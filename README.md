# Demo_MongoDB
First Assignment of Big Data course. In this repo there are 3 folders:
1. JSON: contains the files that have been used to test and edit the database; city_inspections_db.json is the final file that has been used to make the queries and all other test
2. Python: contains the main program and the file that fix the date format in the old json file (city_inspections.db)
3. JupyterNotebook: contains the notebook of the main code

You need to have installed mongodb on your machine and PyMongo module for python. Once you have done these things is possible to run the demo by the `run.sh` script that is written in bash. It will check for python version >= 3 and if PyMongo is installed. This is a really simple README, so I add also my first version of the pdf documentation written in Italian language. In the "Pre-requisiti" chapther you can find all the link to the documentation to install all the things you need to run this assignment. Hope you enjoy, greeting from Italy!
