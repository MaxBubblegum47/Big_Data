[Verse 1]
I could liken you to a werewolf the way you left me for dead
But I admit that I provided a full moon
And I could liken you to a shark the way you bit off my head
But then again I was waving around a bleeding open wound

[Chorus]
But you are such a super guy ’til the second you get a whiff of me
We’re like a wishing well and a bolt of electricity
But we can still support each other, all we gotta do is avoid each other
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key

[Bridge]
The lava of a volcano shot up hot from under the sea
One thing leads to another and you made an island of me

[Verse 2]
And I could liken you to a chemical the way you made me compound a compound
But I'm a chemical, too
Inevitable you and me would mix
And I could liken you to a lot of things but I always come around
‘cause in the end I’m a sensible girl
I know the fiction of the fix

[Chorus]
But you are such a super guy ’til the second you get a whiff of me
We are like a wishing well and a bolt of electricity
But we can still support each other, all we gotta do’s avoid each other
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
