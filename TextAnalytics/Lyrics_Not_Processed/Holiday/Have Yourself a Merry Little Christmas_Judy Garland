[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles
Will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles
Will be miles away

[Verse 3]
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

[Outro]
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now
