[Verse 1]
Lights on the trees under falling snow
You get a bit closer when winter's cold
Now I can't wait till you're by my side
All of the best gifts, you just can't buy

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, you light up the room
I hope that you'll make it back home soon
'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you

[Verse 2]
I wish we were kissing under mistletoe
The stars on the sky just can't match your glow
Now I can't wait till you're by my side
We'll be warm by the fire all night, oh

[Verse 3]
I wanna hold you while the bells are all ringing
Want you to be here while the angel's singing
Days are perfect when I got you near
My only wish is you here

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, you light up the room
I hope that you'll make it back home soon
'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you
Wherever you are, you brighten the moon
I hope that you'll make it back home soon
'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you (Without you)

[Bridge]
We could be outside dancing on the moonlight
Watching the sky roll over our heads
We could be inside trying to sing the lines right
Laughing until we fall out of bed
So when I wake up on Christmas Day
I hope the first thing I see is your face

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, you light up the room
I hope that you'll make it back home soon
'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you
Wherever you are, you brighten the moon
I hope that you'll make it back home soon
'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you (Without you)

[Outro]
It won't feel like Christmas without you
