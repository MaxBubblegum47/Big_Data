[Sabrina Carpenter]:
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on
Let's go and play

[Rowan Blanchard]:
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away

[Kelli Berglund]:
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why

[Piper Curda]:
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye...

Ooh....

[Jordan Fisher]:
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bikes around the halls?

[Grace Phipps]:
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to
The pictures on the walls

[Olivia Holt & Tyrel James Williams]:
It gets a little lonely

[Olivia]:
All these empty rooms
([Tyrel]:
These empty rooms)
Just watching the hours tick by
([Tyrel:]
Tic-tock, tic-tock, tic-tick, tic-tock, tic-tock)

[Piper Curda]:
Do you wanna build a snowman?
([Jake Short]:
Do you wanna be a snowman?)

[Leigh Allyn Baker]:
It doesn't have to be a snowman
([Kevin Chamberlin] :
It doesn't have to be a snowman)
Okay, bye...

Oooh...

All:
Elsa
Please, I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say "have courage"
And I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you
Just let me in

We only have each other
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do?

[Kelli Berglund]:
Do you wanna build a snowman?
([Peyton Clark]:
Do you wanna build a snowman?)

[Rowan Blanchard]:
It doesn't have to be a snowman...

[Rowan Blanchard & Dylan]:
Okay, bye...
