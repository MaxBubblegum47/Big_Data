[Verse 1]
The cold wind is blowin' and the streets are getting dark
I'm writin' you a letter and I don't know where to start
The bells will be ringin' Saint John the Divine
I get a little lonely every year around this time
The music plays all night in Little Italy
The lights will be going up on old Rockefeller tree
People window shopping on Fifth Avenue
All I want for Christmas is you

[Chorus]
I've got to know (Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Where do the lonely hearts go
(Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Oh 'cause nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas

[Verse 2]
Things are different since you've been here last
Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past
Maybe you can bring us some hope this year
Visions of sugar plums have disappeared
Do you remember sleigh riding in the snow
And dancing all night to "Baby, Please Come Home"
Today's celebration is bittersweet
There's mothers and children in the street

[Chorus]
I wanna know (Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go
(Nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas)
'Cause nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas

[Verse 3]
I'm all grown up but I'm the same you'll see
I'm writing you this letter 'cause I still believe
Dear Santa I've been good this year
Can't you stay a little while with me right here

Ooooooh
I've got to know

Saxophone Instrumental

(Tell me) I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go

Oooooh, because nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas
Oooh, nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas
Oooohhh, nobody ought to be
Oooh yeah on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
All alone on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Tell me I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Don't leave me alone (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
All alone  on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Tell me I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do they all go (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
I've got to know (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
Nobody on Christmas (Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas)
