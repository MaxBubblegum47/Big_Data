Old Mr. Kringle is soon gonna jingle
The bells that'll tingle all your troubles away
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is coming again
He's got a sleigh full, it's not gonna stay full
Stuff that he's droppin' every stop of the way
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is coming again

He'll be here
With the answer to the prayers that
You made through the year
You'll get yours
If you've done everything you should extra special good
He'll make this December the one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waitin' for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is coming again

Old Mr. Kringle is soon gonna jingle
All the bells that'll tingle all your troubles away
Everybody's waitin' for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is here again

He's got a sleigh full, and it's not gonna stay full
Got stuff that he's dropping every stop of the way
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
'Cause Christmas is here again

He'll be here
With the answer to the prayers that
You made through the year
You'll get yours
If you've done everything you should extra special good
He'll make this December the one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waitin,' they're all congregating
Waitin' for the man with the bag

Better watch out now!
