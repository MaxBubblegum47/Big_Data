[Verse 1]
Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree
For me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2]
Santa baby, a 54 convertible too
Light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check off my Christmas list

[Verse 3]
Santa baby, I wanna yacht
And really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 4]
Santa honey, one little thing I really need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 5]
Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with a duplex
And checks
Sign your 'X' on the line
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Bridge]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

[Outro]
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, tonight
