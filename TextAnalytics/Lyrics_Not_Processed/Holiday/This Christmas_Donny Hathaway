[Verse 1]
Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas

[Chorus]
Fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me

[Verse 2]
Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town they do
This Christmas

[Chorus]
Fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Shake a hand, shake a hand now

[Verse 3]
Emm, fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

[Outro]
Merry Christmas
Shake a hand, shake a hand now
Wish your brother merry christmas
All over the land, yeah
Merry Christmas
Merry, merry Christmas
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Merry, merry, merry, merry
Emm, em
