[Verse 1]
Winter days, turn to grey, put the headlights on
Snow and rain, wiped away, I can't keep my eyes on the road
When I'm driving home
I got tears, running down, burning in my eyes and
You and I, heated by the flicker of a lighter glow
And I let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
But I just got here
I know it's been a while darling, dear
There's been a change in the time of year
When the frost bites the snow
And Christmas comes around

[Chorus]
For the down-and-outs
And broken lay-abouts
What will they do now?
When Christmas comes around
We were so in love
Till I messed it up
But who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around

[Verse 2]
Family asking me, why I let you go
Telling me, its a mistake
I'm telling them that I know
But I can't call you
You're in a space, better place
Loving on a new man
I don't blame you at all
You did all that you can, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
But I just got here
I know it's been a while darling, dear
There's been a change in the time of year
When the frost bites the snow
And Christmas comes around

[Chorus]
For the down and outs
And broken lay-abouts
What will they do now?
When Christmas comes around
We were so in love
Till I messed it up
But who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around

[Bridge]
And I'm sick of all the songs
The Christmas sing-alongs
The merry and the cheer
'Cause I don't feel like that this year
All the bells are out of sync
And my soul is on the brink
So I'll have myself a drink, and sing
When Christmas comes around

[Chorus + Outro]
For the down-and-outs
And broken lay-abouts
What will they do now?
When Christmas comes around
We were so in love
Till I messed it up
But who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around
Who will love me now?
When Christmas comes around
