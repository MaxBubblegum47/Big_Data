[Chorus]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow, snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Interlude (spoken)]
The sun is shining
The grass is green
The orange and palm trees sway
There's never been such a day in old L.A
But it's December the 24th
And I'm longing to be up north
So I can have my very own white Christmas

(sung)
Oh yeah!

[Chorus]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white, yeah
Be white!
