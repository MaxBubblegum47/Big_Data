[Verse 1: Avril Lavigne & Johnny Blu]
I really can't stay
Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away
But baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fire place roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour

[Verse 2: Avril Lavigne & Johnny Blu, Both]
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
Ain't no cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no, sir
Do you Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Baby it's cold outside

[Verse 3: Avril Lavigne & Johnny Blu]
I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is "No"
But, baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So very warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Ooh, your lips are delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

[Verse 4: Avril Lavigne & Johnny Blu, Both]
I've got to get home
But Baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a coat?
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life-long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you got pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that hold out
Baby it's cold
Baby it's cold outside
