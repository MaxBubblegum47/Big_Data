[Intro]
Helluva made this beat, baby

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Off top, run a nigga out his socks
Niggas talk more than bitches, niggas really be on cock though (Pussy)
Just fucked a ho out in France, paint her face like Picasso
I iced out my vatos, I'm really up (Yeah)
Big ass Bimmer, big Benz, and my Bentley next (Skrrt)
Don't play around on my phone, ho, give me sex
Watch on my wrist out of date, but it's Rolex
Grizzley up next, I'm up now, strap your bullet vest

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Five-hundred fifties, six-hundred hundreds
Seven-hundreds twenties, let's get straight to it
Eight-hundred tens, what's that, eight bands?
Hit the store and get some rubber bands, let's get straight to it
Everybody come together, everybody got the plan
He came with you, so if he steal, it fall on you, we on your ass
Have your mans call his mans, make sure they ain't movin' fast
Soon as they touch Atlanta, get with Boat, secure the bag, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Uh, oh, a bag secured, that's on my mama, bro
Asian lil' ho, she ride that dick, Yokohama flow
Made that shit double, got an Uzi, I don't scuffle
Not a banger but that banger in my car like an airbag
Niggas only aimin' in the sky, call those Air Mags (Yeah)
All up in Neiman's, coppin' shit like fuck a price tag
I'm ballin', ain't near a rap nigga in the game that I'm callin' (Nah)
If I need help, I'll dial it by my se-kelf

[Verse 4: Tee Grizzley & Lil Yachty]
You swear your bitch faithful, she sent her location
I hit her at the trap in Decatur, she basic (Crazy)
Chop with the laser, get decapitated (Grrah)
Can't smoke, I'm on papers, hold on, this my Jamaican (Love one)
Niggas want me dead, so I'm steady prayin'
Ain't no disrespect without retaliation
Fuck a hotel, I hit her in the basement
Text her later like, "I'm done with you, I got a situation, baby"

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Hmm, well shit, bro, let me get her then (Yeah)
I'ma dog her out then switcheroo into the lion's den (Gang)
Nigga talkin' down, my bro got more heat than a fryin' pan (Doo-doo-doo)
Gucci 'round my hair, wrapped tight like I'm Taliban

[Verse 6: Tee Grizzley & Lil Yachty]
Like I'm Taliban, how we drop shit (Begone)
Lot of dreadheads, lot of chopsticks (Ah)
Touch my nigga Yachty, get your top ripped (Lil Boat, boom)
Don't ask the price if you know you ain't tryna cop shit

[Verse 7: Lil Yachty]
You the type to look around but never cop shit, ayy
I'm the type to buy the store, make them restock it, ayy
Beam on everythin' I own, I will not miss (Doo-doo-doo)
Grizzley by my side like a pilot ridin' cockpit (Yeah, bro)

[Verse 8: Tee Grizzley & Lil Yachty]
Yachty, I might stop rappin' for this one reason (Oh, for real?)
If the Feds hear this shit I'm doin' a hundred seasons
In the hood, shootin' craps in my Yeezys
Put angels on you niggas who be playin' like y'all demons
You dig?

[Verse 9: Lil Yachty]
Middle finger to them niggas hatin' and fakin'
They plottin' on my death, I give their mothers deep penetration
This diamond choker for some reason give me pure ventilation
Every real nigga livin' will respect this collaboration (Gang gang)

[Verse 10: Tee Grizzley]
We the bust down brothers, check the Rollies out
Say you winnin' one more time, I'm pullin' trophies out
Niggas know we out, no Shaqs, all Kobes out
In other words, I'm with all shooters that'll blow you down (Buh-buh-buh-buh)

[Verse 11: Lil Yachty & Tee Grizzley]
From the D to the A, put respect on it (Bitch)
If that's your ho, why my dick got her mouth on it? (Bitch)
I'm from the south, I got diamonds in my teeth
I got fur on my fleece, my new ring could pay your lease
(Lease, nigga)

[Verse 12: Tee Grizzley]
Chain on my dresser next to my indictment
When they said not guilty I was so excited
From the A to the D, bitch you heard Yachty
Wraith comin' this summer, I'ma have your bitch drivin'
Bitch!
