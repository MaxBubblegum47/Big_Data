[Intro]
I like 'em big, and I like 'em small
And if I had to take the oath, I would take them all
Gimme that rough stuff
(It's what I want)

[Verse 1]
She's a saint, she's a sinner
She's a rave, rave, rave
She's a woman, she's a winner
In every way, way, way

[Bridge]
She don't want love
Nor cabaret, that's out
She like to play it wild
That suits me fine
I like it better when she read my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
You know, don't want a woman with a ball and chain
Don't wanna play that game

[Chorus]
Just gimme that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby, gimme ruff stuff
You don't want ruff stuff?
Don't want your face around here

[Verse 2]
Make you shake, make you shiver
Make you pray, pray, pray
Gonna make you quake, make you quiver
And turn you grey, grey, grey

[Bridge]
I don't need brakes
They slow me down too much
They keep me out of touch
They lock me out
I like it better when I pull the pin

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't want a woman with a ball and chain
Don't want to play that game

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Intro Reprise]
I like them big, and I like 'em small
And if you asked me to take an oath
Why, I would take them all

[Chorus]
Gimme that ruff stuff
Gimme that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby, gimme ruff stuff
Babe, I want ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff, baby
Baby, gimme ruff stuff
I'm takin' all the ruff stuff
I want it, yeah

[Outro]
Don't want your face 'round here, that's it
Don't want your face 'round here
I don't want your face around my backyard any more
I don't
