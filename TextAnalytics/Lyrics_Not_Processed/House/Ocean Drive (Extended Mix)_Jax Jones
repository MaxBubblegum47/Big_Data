[Verse 1]
We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding through the dark night, night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love, but it's never enough, nah
As the sirens fill the lonely air
Oh, how did we get here now, now, now babe
We see a storm is closing in
Pretending we ain't scared

[Pre-Chorus]
Picked you up on Ocean Avenue
With neon in your eyes
And dreams of city lights
Oh yeah, oh
You're the one I used to idolize
I knew it wasn't right
Addicted to this high
Addicted, so I...

[Chorus]
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (ooh, yeah)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (ooh, ooh)
We're out of time on the highway to never (ah, yeah)
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)

[Verse 2]
We're running all the red lights down
No way that we can stop, nah, nah
A quarter tank and almost gone
Pretending we're in love, but it's never enough, nah
I wish we could take it back in time
Before we crossed the line now, now, now, babe
We see a storm is closing in (oh, oh, oh)
I reach out for your hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Picked you up on Ocean Avenue
With neon in your eyes
And dreams of city lights
Oh yeah, oh
You're the one I used to idolize
I knew it wasn't right
Addicted to this high
Addicted, so I...

[Chorus]
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on), hold on
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (ooh, yeah)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (ooh, ooh)
We're out of time on the highway to never (ah, yeah)
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on), hold on

[Bridge]
Ooh, oh, ooh yeah
Hold on
Hold on, oh yeah, oh
Hold on
Hold on
(Ocean Avenue)
(Ocean Avenue) Hold on, ooh yeah
