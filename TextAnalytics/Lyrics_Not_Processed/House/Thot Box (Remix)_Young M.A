[Intro: Mulatto]
Hitmaka
N-N-Nonstop
Yeah

[Chorus: Mulatto]
I ain't fuckin' with no thot box
Make him eat it in the drop-top (Skrrt)
Think she ill, but she not hot
Racks comin' in nonstop (Yeah)
Big rocks on that crop-top (Rocks on that crop-top)
I took his Benz to the chop-shop (Ooh)
He ain't fuckin' with no thot box
I'm gettin' topped in a drop-top (Mmh)

[Verse 1: Young M.A]
She high class, Henny in her wine glass
Closet full of shoes and design bags
She got a name, but everybody call her fine ass (Why?)
With that fine ass (Ooh)
Ain't even gotta see her top half
Foreign and a foreign, she a mix breed (She a mix breed)
Hips on parentheses (Parentheses)
If she drive stick, it's a six speed (Skrrt)
Yellow in the inside, Swiss cheese (Ooh)
Vroom vroom, and that pum-pum on pooh-pooh
She got that wet wet, we gon' have the best sex
I'ma kill the kitty, that’s a death threat (That's a death, ooh)
So you can say we fuckin' on her deathbed (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Chinese Kitty]
Wack bitch call and said she want her boo back
Send that nigga home, pussy juice on his durag
I ain't gotta suck dick for no verse
If I put money on your head, then put money in my purse, bitch
Nigga slid in my DM with the blue check
Only want them blue racks, nigga, you can keep that
Make the nigga go down, tell him eat that
Had the nigga singin' to my pussy like Keith Sweat
This ain't no motherfuckin' thot box
Pussy had a nigga sweatin' like a hot box
He be searchin' for that pussy like wifi
Rich nigga, eight figure, that's my type

[Verse 3: Dreezy]
Thought he was catfished, I look better off of IG (My pretty ass)
Let him slurp out the box like a Hi-C
I'm with my bloods and that pump like an IV
Full course meal, your main nigga my side piece
Play with me, you off more than just pot smoke (Stupid)
Nigga thinkin' he a player, he a thot though (Hah)
Shawty rent late but flying out to Cabo (What?)
I'm just sayin', you gotta watch hoes (Got to)
Got ten star credit, my pictures don't need no editin'
That work still sellin', my pussy, ain't no comparison (Uh-huh)
He hit it once, nigga thought I sold crack
When he hit it doggystyle, grab his balls from the back, yeah
Three G's and a blunt for the hot spot
If it ain't head, leave it read, that's a cock block, yeah (Bye)
Now this thot want a shot
'Fore I even get to pour up, she suckin' out the top (Damn)

[Verse 4: Dream Doll]
You don't eat it, you don't beat it, I say that 'cause I mean it
Treat the pussy like the paper, don’t let nothin' come between it
Call my box Medusa, you get hard when you see it
I might put it on the app, you gotta download and stream it
Wanna beat it, wanna skeet it, spend a rack (Spend a rack)
I told him throw them hundreds if you want me throw it back
I get face in the Phantom and get brains in the back
He say he don't be on head, but we all know he cap (You cap)
Now back to the track, I'm rollin' in my droptop (Skrrt)
And my titties sittin' pretty in my crop-top (Hey, hey)
Nigga say he tryna get up in that thot box (Ah)
But you be fuckin' anything that walk, you got thot cock (Nigga)

[Chorus: Mulatto]
I ain't fuckin' with no thot box
Make him eat it in the drop-top (Skrrt)
Think she ill, but she not hot
Racks comin' in nonstop (Yeah)
Big rocks on that crop-top (Rocks on that crop-top)
I took his Benz to the chop-shop (Ooh)
He ain't fuckin' with no thot box
I'm gettin' topped in a drop-top (Mmh)
