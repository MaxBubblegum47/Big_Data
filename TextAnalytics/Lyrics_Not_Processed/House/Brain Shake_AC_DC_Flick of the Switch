[Verse 1]
Alright, hold tight
I really want to ball tonight
On a bender, no space defender
A joy on the floor, I'll get it tight
Toe-to-toe with a black widow
Fee-fi-foe, smell the blood of rock 'n' roll
All out drive on a rockin' suicide

[Pre-Chorus]
My feet are jumping, she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, a joy to ride
She's a joy to drive on a rocking suicide

[Chorus]
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
All I can take
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake

[Verse 2]
She's a mean, lean rockin' machine
A hip-hugging blue jeaned dream
She's a woman worth giving
A sweet sweet kissin'
Lips are running 'round on me
Well, it's a toe-to-toe with a black widow
Fee-fi-foe, smell the blood of rock 'n' roll
All out drive on a rocking suicide

[Pre-Chorus]
My feet are jumping, she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, joy to ride
She's a joy to drive on a rocking suicide

[Chorus]
Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Ready to shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake[x2]
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, joy to ride
She's an all out drive on a rocking suicide
It's a shake

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Ready to shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Don't have to beg
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
You can't fake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Well it's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
For mercy's sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain[x3]
Shake
