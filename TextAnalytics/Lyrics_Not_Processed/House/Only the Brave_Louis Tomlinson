[Verse 1]
Pour mercy, mercy on me, set fire to history
I'm breakin' my own rules, I'm cryin' like a fool
Tall stories on the page, short glories on the fade
I been close enough to touch, but I never cared for love

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a church of burnt romances
And I'm too far gone to pray
It's a solo song and it's only for the brave

[Chorus]
If the truth tell, darling, you fell
Like there ain't enough dying stars in your sky
It's a tall tale, and it's only hello, hello, no goodbye (Goodbye)

[Verse 2]
Pour mercy, mercy on me, I'll fall upon my knees
And they'll say, "I told you so
Come on, when you know, you know"
All the lonely shadow dances from the cradle to the grave
It's a solo song and it's only for the brave
