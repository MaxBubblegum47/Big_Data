[Intro] [Big Sean]
Aye. Aye, B.I.G. (Detroit) yeah
Look, G.O.O.D. Music, T3, Black Milk yeah (Finally famous in this)
Mick Boogie (Get money). Uh, aye, aye

[Verse One] [Big Sean]
Look
Man I do it for the life, love, lights, the glory
Fresh from the battle field with no injuries
And yes, still I rise more than juries
I hear success callin' so I'm in a hurry
To be the best that you have seen
On a journey of my life, no canteen
And I ain't into splittin' ends, no Pantene
Man, I ball without bricks, kept my hands clean
Hittin' every C-Note but I can't sing
Fully fueled off my dreams, fuck caffeine
My heads in the clouds
You have been warned
Lightening might strike if I make it brain storm
Right on yo bitch, now she's on
On her way home and she might bring Sean
Ha, man I can tell they gettin' tired
Cause I gotta listen to my own shit to get inspired

[Hook] [Peter Bjorn & John] [x2]
Is it your present
Or just the past?

[Verse Two] [Black Milk]
Yeah, Black Milk
They tryin' to figure out how the rhymes keep comin'
Beats keep drummin'
He's most persistent, he's onto something, yeah
Just keep tellin' yourself that
But it ain't hard for me to be better than the rest at
Who ya?
The game y'all ruin
So now I'm one of the best in this thing called music
Humble pie
Son don't lie
He spits steady clips just so the sun won't shine
Leave him in darkness
Don't, became heartless
Left him headless once the sword became sharpened
I should lighten up
But instead I'm the shades of the future of this game's not bright enough
Destroy
Then we build from the ground up
We build a movement, felt how the ground shook
Look
I left the world outdone from the past to present you get the same outcome

[Hook] [Peter Bjorn & John] [x2]
Is it your parents
Or just the past?

[Verse Three] [T3]
Yeah, it sound epic
Expect the best methods
Trey Allah
The ? God father
I built a machine that was dead from the get go
Got a little green like that Geico gecko
And kill a little scene like sicko psycho
Yo, I tell a nigga, you gotta get your weight up
Jumpin' in the water with a shark will get you ate up
You should have read the warning signs
One of them was "Dan-ger"
Like The Love Of Ray, y'all niggas is come-dy
You know me
Black Shakespearean, modern day
Poet
Seein' more girls than the Jonas Brothers
We ain't gotta guess
We know what they thinkin' of us
Man, this is why it's so tight
Get 'em hype like, Mike
We the highlights when the light's bright (right)
The game is ours
We got it locked
Watch my verses turn to prison bars
Go

[Hook] [Peter Bjorn & John] [x2]
Is it your parents
Or just the past?
