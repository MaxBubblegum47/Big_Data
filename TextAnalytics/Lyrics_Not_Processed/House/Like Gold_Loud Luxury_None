[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know you make me feel like gold?
I'm hypnotized and under your control
Don't want you to ever let me go
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel

[Chorus]
With every touch, your body feels like home
You write a symphony inside my soul
I don't want you to ever let me go
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel

[Drop]
Like gold
Like gold
Like gold
Like gold

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause don't you know you make me feel like gold?
I'm hypnotized and under your control
Don't want you to ever let mе go
'Cause you make me feel, you makе me feel

[Chorus]
With every touch, your body feels like home
You write a symphony inside my soul
I don't want you to ever let me go
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel

[Drop]
Like gold
Like gold
Like gold
Like gold

[Post-Drop]
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel

[Drop]
Like gold
Like gold
Like gold
Like gold

[Outro]
'Cause don't you know your body feels like home?
You write a symphony inside my soul
I don't want you to ever let me go
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel
Like gold
