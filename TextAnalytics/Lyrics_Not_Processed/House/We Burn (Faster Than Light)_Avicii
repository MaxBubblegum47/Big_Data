[Verse]
All my life I've been learning
I've always lived for today
And I don't know about tomorrow
But I can choose who I become

[Pre-Chorus]
Got wasted too many days
I got led on the wrong way, oh
You left on a Wednesday
It might have even been your birthday, oh
You told me to "go fuck yourself"
Guess I rubbed you the wrong way, oh
I wasted too many days

[Chorus]
And we
We burn faster than light
Shine across in the night sky
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Got wasted too many days
I got led on the wrong way, oh
You left on a Wednesday
It might have even been your birthday, oh
You told me to "go fuck yourself"
Guess I rubbed you the wrong way, oh
I wasted too many days

[Chorus]
And we
We burn faster than light
Shine across in the night sky
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light

[Instrumental Outro]
