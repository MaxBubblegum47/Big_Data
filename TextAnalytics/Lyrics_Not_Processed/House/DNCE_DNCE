[Intro]
D-N-C-E
D-N-C-E
D-N-C-E
D-N-C-E, dance
Okay, see if you can catch up
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Sippin' on a bottle, 'til the bottle's starin' back at you
(Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Back against the wall, 'til the poison makes my body move
(Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Refrain]
If he can, and she can, then they can get weird together
If he can, and she can, then we can be weird forever
Sippin' on a bottle, 'til the bottle's starin' back at you
(Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't fire but it burns my throat
This ain't water but it floats my boat
Put your feet above your hands and D-N-C-E, dance

[Chorus]
Woo, if you ain't leavin', dance
You better D-N-C-E, dance
Don't fight the feelin' now, dance
You better D-N-C-E, dance
Dance, D-N-C-E

[Verse 2]
Sippin', and I'm slippin' even further into make believe
Whiskey got me wishin' that you'd come D-N-C-E with me

[Refrain]
If he can, and she can, then they can get weird together
If he can, and she can then we can be weird forever
Sippin', and I'm slippin' even further into make believe

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't fire but it burns my throat
This ain't water but it floats my boat
Put your feet above your hands and D-N-C-E, dance

[Chorus]
Woo, if you ain't leavin', dance
You better D-N-C-E, dance
Don't fight the feelin' now, dance
You better D-N-C-E, dance
Dance, D-N-C-E

[Bridge]
Alright, let's see if you can do this!
Ah 
(Dance)
Dance, step left foot, then the other foot 
(Dance)
Wave right hand, then the other hand 
(Dance)
Shake your head like you don't understand
How to dance, how to dance, how to D-N-C-E
D-N, you, wait, you forgot the A, bro 
(Dance)

[Chorus]
Woo, if you ain't leavin', dance
You better D-N-C-E, dance
Don't fight the feelin' now, dance
You better D-N-C-E, dance
Dance, D-N-C-E
Woo, if you ain't leavin', dance
You better D-N-C-E, dance
Don't fight the feelin' now, dance
You better D-N-C-E, dance
Dance, D-N-C-E
