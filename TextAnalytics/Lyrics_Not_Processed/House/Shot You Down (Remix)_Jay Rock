[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
I take a drag at the square, I feel anxious, spit dangerous
As the verbal appears, it's reflectin' my perspective
Beer goggle and fear, role model so hollow
Shadow adolescence and a gaggle of them bitches
Road to the rich is still paved with the ditches
Get caught up in the hype, your career is for a night
I ain't these other niggas, 'cause these niggas is fake
They ain't poppin' shot, these niggas is Papa Doc
Fine as the shine, beam me up, and I'm ridin' Spock
No cryin' 'til I'm in a pine box
I got the bitches hittin' Mikey like where Zay at?
Prolly fuckin' on her friend, prolly L.A. at
Prolly plottin' on a mil', stayin' well fed
Bitch, don't run your mouth, we don't play that
Momma taught me better, can't count on niggas
Can't count on weather – go figure, nigga
They ain't worried 'bout this cheddar
Them niggas just sky divin' in my propellers, I don't feel 'em
Ain't tryna be no freshman, I'm chillin'
'Cause they'll bring a knife to the fight, and 
I'll
 kill 'em
Me and my niggas is hungry, we're willin'
To bring a little ho to the party and Meek Mill 'em
Yeah, I feel like talkin' my shit
Come in the house, actin' friendly, you can suck my dick
I'm prayin' for some good rappers and a Fleetwood
Why I gotta bring my A game? You just D goods
We don't wanna hear that weak shit, nigga, speak up
Rockin' old flows, cornrows, and a beeper
You niggas hoes, you niggas hoes, and I ain't even trippin'
'Cause we'll be laughin' to the bank and ridin' by these niggas
Mikey, bring that mink with your low body Bentley
Put the hood in the fuckin' trunk and bring the party with me

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad & 
Jay Rock
]
I came, I saw, I conquered, ayy – I shot you down
Now your brain no have no conscious, ayy – what you do now?
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered, ayy – I shot you down
Now, I bang, I bang, I blocka, ayy – what you do now?
Oh, bitch-ass rappers, ayy – I shot you down
No sensitive niggas, ayy – I shot you down
No bitch-ass rappers, ayy – I shot you down
No Hypebeast pussies, ayy – what you do now?
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered, ayy – I shot you down
Now your brain no have no conscious, ayy – what you do now?
Check, check, one, two, what's up?
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered, ayy – I shot you down
It's Rock, yo, yeah, what's up?
Now, I bang, I bang, I blocka, ayy – what you do?
Yeah, look
Don't make a sound

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Everything takes time
Is you sellin' or you buyin', nigga? Get rich or die tryin'
Yay Yay on the stove, I had the choppers in the Cutlass
Just a young nigga tryna get some hundreds
I had a little bucket – yeah, I rode it like a Benz
Yeah, I spent my little ends on that Butlass
Tell me, who you trust – look, I got my faith in God
'Cause these clown-ass niggas all busters
These niggas not Jesus, they ain't gon' die for you
And only time will tell what's gon' lie for you
It's funny, right? What a couple lies will do
But seein' is believin' what defines the truth
I keep shooters on the wing when I'm ridin' through
And if niggas out of bounds they gon' probably shoot
(Block, block) 'Cause killing is the hobby
Eastside niggas, yeah, we known for catchin' bodies
I used to have a deuce five ridin' on the trolly
On my way to school like dare, nigga, try me
Look, 'cause where I'm from, I'm a blood on an island
Surrounded by blue water, sharks all around me
Pigs on my ass, hoes tryna drown me
Niggas know I'm up, so these haters wanna down me
Niggas know I'm king but they don't wanna crown me
It's okay, I ain't 'bout to whine about it
Look, a real nigga for real nigga, now check it
I'm still here, I'm still counting my blessin's
With no chains on, with no rings on
Watchin' these fake rappers, gettin' my aim on
Pop a shot, kill 'em all (kill 'em all)
And watch 'em fall like confetti, fuck 'em all (fuck 'em all)
It's just me and my niggas, we takin' over the game
And since I conquered this craft, nothin' will be the same

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Not a dollar on me, this home invasion a payday
Two-time felon, they jerkin' me on my pay rate
Slavin' all these hours but couldn't shake that my rent late
Makin' eight a hour, I'm leanin' towards my AK
Moms thinks I'm vicious, don't want me 'round the kitchen
My livin' room, bathroom, my bedroom was evicted
Missin' from your homeroom, my good grades was crippin'
Before I even learned division, nigga, I learnt the mission
See I'm from where fiends scratch that itch, won't hit the lotto
And I'm from where fiends fix that fix and not a bottle
And that little nigga that missed that bottle gon' catch a hollow
Or maybe even throw him pyro, pyro
See this set don't make too many niggas rich that I know
You either gang bang, sell dope, or bet on the four
Seen money on the ground, my eyes glued to the floor
I double deuce by my toe, see Figg get it and go
I feel stuck in my ways, a nigga just tryna get paid
I'm tired of answerin' questions; "Why 
Oxymoron
 delayed?"
See I was thinkin' November, but January is sweet
It set my 
Setbacks
 free, my 
Habits
 won in my sleep
So January agree, get a taste of this gangsta
See, I'm just tryna eat, with the freak of the week
I just wanna hit 'em and leave 'em, dawg, they yours for the keep
But don't be kissin' them broads, my sperm on their teeth
Last night was nothin', this mornin' I'm a hero
No belief in me, dawg, they said I'd mount to zero
Cocaine, cocaine, rock-rock kilo
Fishscale, cut well, you won't find Nemo
Pull up to the block and they call me real nigga
See, I can be a real nigga, but my daughter see me bigger
See a body full of love and yours full of liquor
But you'll always be my nigga, said, you'll always be my nigga

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad]
I came, I saw, I conquered, ayy – I shot you down
Now your brain no have no conscious, ayy – what you do now?
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered, ayy – I shot you down
Now, I bang, I bang, I blocka, ayy – what you do now?
Oh, bitch-ass rappers, ayy – I shot you down
No sensitive niggas, ayy – I shot you down
No bitch-ass rappers, ayy – I shot you down
No Hypebeast pussies, ayy – what you do now?
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered, ayy – I shot you down
Now your brain no have no conscious, ayy – what you do now?
Now, I came, I saw, I conquered, ayy – I shot you down
Now, I bang, I bang, I blocka, ayy – what you do?
Don't make a sound
