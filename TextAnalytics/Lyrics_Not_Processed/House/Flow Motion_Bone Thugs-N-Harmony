[Intro]
Flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow
I flow (flow) when I go (go) in flow mo
I flow when I go in flow mo
I flow when I go in flow mo
I flow when I go in flow mo

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
Layzie Bone is in the house, I'm gettin' it starrrted up
And it's my parrrt of the cut to let you know
That the harrrder not to haul, you're stuck
I get the gauge, and let it blast and get you shot
And then you drop, you're popped
So now I got to free the block
I'm breakin' 'em, takin' 'em, makin' 'em
Fakin' 'em, shakin' 'em off to a new height
I rocks the mic, yes, I'm hype
I love to write, so don't you bite
Yeah, I'm the Bone, that nigga that's on the microphone
You shoulda known, you're fuckin' with me, yeah, it's on
'Cause I got Krayzie and Bizzy Bone without a doubt
Wish Bone, and my bigger brother Stan Howse
So call your posse, you gonna need 'em
When the Bone's approachin', 'cause I be doin' a flow motion

[Verse 2: Wish Bone]
We never get caught whenever we run
Because we throw bolo
I'm hypin' 'em up, and strikin' 'em up
To keep 'em in flow mo
You step and you're stuck
Now, what in the fuck is up with this dumb shit?
I'm packin' a 9 most all of the time, now back up, bitch!
I'm locked down all the time
Because I might go psycho
For drinkin' that Cisco, and poppin' my pistol
You're claimin' you're rough
I'm callin' your bluffâ€”so, what's up, sucka?
I'm callin' my niggas, pullin' them triggers
Quicker than a mothafucka

[Hook]
I flow (flow) when I go (go) in flow mo
I flow (flow) when I go (go) in flow mo
I flow when I go in flow mo
I flow when I go in flow mo

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
A 187, a lesson
For niggas who think they get with the Bone
The weapon is kept in a trench and
So give me the gat, at once you're shown
There's nothin' flow like flow mo
I roll with the Bone, no never go solo
Time and time again, think I'm gonna need for smoke 'em
So, so, no, no, 'cause I don't think
That Biz will ever back down
You cross our ways, so you sing
Then you chill in the background
I'm psycho and like Michael, no one on my level
Let's meet in the cemetery
And no, don't forget the shovels
(Layzie Bone: I'm diggin' a ditch]
For the sucka who thought that they could fade me
Chillin' with my nigga Wish, Layzie and Krayzie
The gauge be pointed at your temple in our land
My F-L-O-M-O-T-I-O-N can

[Hook]
Flow, flow, flow, flow
Flow, flow, flow, flow

[Verse 4: Krayzie Bone]
Well, it's the nigga, the nigga, the nigga, the once again
And niggas they pick up the pen and they try to contend
See, all that they win is a MAC-10
It's blastin', pick up my gun
And you're runnin' now from the assassin
Pumpin' the clip and you askin'
"Who in the fuck was that masked man?"
The nigga that pulled the trigga
'Cause I'm slimmer they figured they bigger
But when you can see the real killer is peelin' your cap
Nigga that's runnin' the pack
They step, so pack the gat, tossin' your life
I proceed with the murders
Servin' off in a coffin, you're fucked
Because your niggas, they heard that I buck
So, don't think you'll win when I got my steel
And I'm feelin it, when you feelin' a pain
Well, like I'm insane
And know I can throw the gauge if you complain
There's never another to go with a brother
While smutherin' suckers been goin' undercover
We leave 'em in gutters, ain't goin' to get caught
But who was the sucka that's squealed on a murder?
Well, 187 the weapon is kept and
You step and get learned a lesson
I grab my Smith & Wesson for punks that run to test
And so punks get ready to drop
'Cause I'm on a roll and you'll get smoked, and
I'm kickin' a gangsta twist
Let's keep 'em movin' in flow motion

[Hook]
I flow (flow) when I go (go) in flow mo
I flow (flow) when I go (go) in flow mo
I flow when I go in flow mo
I flow when I go in flow mo
Flow, flow, flow, flow
Flow, flow, flow, flow
