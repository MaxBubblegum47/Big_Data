[Intro]
RedOne, MT
Hey

[Verse 1]
Aren't we all born in the middle?
Somewhere, somewhere in the middle babe, uh
Don't we all wonder a little?
Undress me now, I'm flexible

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't only one word for me
I don't wanna close my mind
So you better get used to me

[Chorus]
I've never been conventional baby
I'm original
I've never been one dimensional baby
I'm original
I've never been conventional baby
I'm original
I've never been one dimensional baby
I'm original
I've never been one dimensional baby
I'm original

[Verse 2]
Trust me, I'm more than my body
Soul is singing through my body, babe uh
I could be yours if you want me
Don't let me down, undress me now

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't only one word for me
I don't wanna close my mind
So you better get used to me

[Chorus]
I've never been conventional baby
I'm original
I've never been one dimensional baby
I'm original
I've never been conventional baby
I'm original
I've never been one dimensional baby
I'm original (Don't you know me baby?)
I've never been one dimensional baby
I'm original

[Bridge]
Let me show you what
Original, unconditional love is
Girl, don't be shy
Let me show you what
Original, unconditional love is
I won't be shy

[Chorus]
I've never been conventional baby
I'm original
I've never been one dimensional baby (woo)
I'm original (I'm original)
I've never been conventional baby  (don't you know me baby?)
I'm original
I've never been one dimensional baby (don't you know me baby?)
I'm original
Don't you know? Don't you know?
I've never been one dimensional baby
I'm original
