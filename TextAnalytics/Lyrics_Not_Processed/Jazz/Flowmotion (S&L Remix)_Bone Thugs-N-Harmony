[Intro: Krazyie Bone]
Flow round by the wind
Flow motion
Flow round by the wind
Flow motion

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
Who is that cuttin' with a tongue like a double edged sword?
Talkin' out the neck, like we wouldn't push forward
But we murdered you niggas and ran circles 'round you niggas
And we looked for competition but there wasn't none for us
Shit got bor'n, back to the hood
Where the thugs and the fiends sold crack in the hood
Took my money and my trophies, and my plaques to the hood
Niggas wasn't goin' out Hollywood, not Bone
We keep it gutter, thuggish ruggish niggas from the nine-nine
I flip a hustle, been around the world a couple times
Check the record, you could see I'm workin' double time
Give 'em somethin' they can feel when I'm on the grind
Let the gangsta's ride, in the summer time shine real bright
Did you wanna get down?, Let the top back slow
Take a drag of the dro, 'cause it's Bone's time now, you can burn that now

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
I flow when I go in flow mo’ (Flow round by the wind)
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo'
I flow when I go in flow mo’
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo' (Flow motion)
I flow when I go in flow mo’ (Flow round by the wind)
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo'
I flow when I go in flow mo’
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo' (Flow motion)

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Tryna keep it to the rhythm if a nigga really figure you can handle
I'll make you an example, sample, when I start releasin' lyrics at random
Clearin' on 'em makin' out just like a phantom, famine
See me with a gun doin' a hundred while I'm runnin'
Comin' at ya with it sound like thunder, strike like lightnin'
Hit 'em and they wonder, where the hell that all them thuggish
Ruggish niggas come from? Bone-Bone-Bone
Never be another that can fuck with them thug brothers, they all the same
They talk a lot but never got the balls to play
Niggas better not look at all this way, no, not this way
Whenever we gon split 'em to this grissle
Blew the whistle, on the Swizzle it's official
And we about to get it crackin' in the middle of the action
We got cha' in Flow Motion

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
I flow when I go in flow mo’ (Flow round by the wind)
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo'
I flow when I go in flow mo’
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo' (Flow motion)
I flow when I go in flow mo’ (Flow round by the wind)
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo'
I flow when I go in flow mo’
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo' (Flow motion)

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
Ball your fist, pull your pistol, put your finger in the middle
I'ma show ya how to disrespect a disrespectful nigga, let him loose
Fuck a lawsuit, I gotta get him, lay him up somewhere where his cap spinnin', you ain't get it?
Hospital rehab, he alright, one to the chest, to the knee-caps
I'ma keep it raw so you know you better back off
Swizz said get 'em so you know we 'bout to bite ya'll, F.S. yup, yup
See when we roll up, everybody roll up, everbody toast up
Get it twisted, nigga, pay attention when you leave
With your 'realness' and feelings hurt, shirt full of dirt, nigga we work with cha
I'ma let that nigga be first
Back again and get it, gotta be heard
Had a intermission but it's over, it's over
Back to flow motion on 'em

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
I flow when I go in flow mo’
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo'
I flow when I go in flow mo’
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo' (Flow motion)
I flow when I go in flow mo’
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo'
I flow when I go in flow mo’
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo' (Flow motion)
I flow when I go in flow mo’ (Flow round by the wind)
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo'
I flow when I go in flow mo’
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo' (Flow motion)
I flow when I go in flow mo’ (Flow round by the wind)
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo'
I flow when I go in flow mo’
I flow-flow when I go in in flow mo' (Flow motion)
