SCAT CAT
]
Everybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat
Who knows where it's at

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Tell me
Everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat
'Cause everything else is obsolete

[SCAT CAT, spoken]
Strictly high-button shoes!

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
A square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born

[SCAT CAT]
Ever'time he plays

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
But with a square in the act
You can set music back

[SCAT CAT]
To the cave man days
Cha-cha-ba-dum-bo-day

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing

[SCAT CAT]
Still a cat's the only cat who knows how to swing

[BILLY BOSS]
Who wants to dig a long-haired gig and stuff like that?

[SCAT CAT, THOMAS O'MALLEY]
When everybody wants to be a cat
A square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born
Ever'time he plays

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Oh, a-rinky-tinky-tinky

[SCAT CAT, THOMAS O'MALLEY]
With a square in the act, you can set music back
To the cave man days

[MARIE]
Oh, a-rinky-tinky-tinky

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Yes

[MARIE, THOMAS O'MALLEY & SCAT CAT]
Everybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at
While playin' jazz you always has a welcome mat
'Cause everybody digs a swingin' cat

[DUCHESS]
If you want to turn me on
Play your horn, don't spare the tone
And blow a little soul into the tune

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Let's take it to another key

[SCAT CAT]
Modulate, and wait for me
I'll take a few ad-libs and pretty soon

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
The other cats will all commence
Congregatin' on the fence
Beneath the alley's only light

[DUCHESS]
Where every note is out of sight

[ALLEY CATS]
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Hallelujah!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (I'm telling you!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Yeah!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Mmm)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Hallelujah!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat...
