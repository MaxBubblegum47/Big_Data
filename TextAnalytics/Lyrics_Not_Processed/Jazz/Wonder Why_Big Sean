[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Verse 1 (Wale)]
Don't wonder my hours long and I never tire
Because a nigga grind well exceeding 9 to 5
Who fear a 9 to 5, seein' me again?
I came through with diseased semen on my pen
That's AIDs to the ill
LA to the Chilly
East Coast, still them W's just raised up for real
Felatio fetish, broads know me where I live
Brought dimes to Brazil, fuck the currency ya dig?
Still they wonder how I seem so confident
One can seem pompous
Me and you just need to talk a bit
I ain't your regular rapper who just be talking shit
Listen to it a lil' closer, hear the gospel in it
How I maneuver through the studio is hallelujah
You dudes peak too early like Biakabutuka
I share rhyme in the sewer
Pepe Le Pew my music
You ain't the reason why they came like the fries at hooters
I'm beside the future
They can't get rid of it
I'm past, present, every day's December 25th
Jolly ol' Saint Nicholas
Take your pick
Admire my style, flyer than Kid Icarus

[Hook (Mike Posner)]
Just because you know me, you don't know me
I've been tryin'a do it big since '03
And I got a little big, keep it low key
Tryin'a keep up with my mind, and you wonder why
You on my mind
Don't wonder why
Their sayin on my mind

[Verse 2 (Big Sean)]
Better then whoever nigga as is
I'm always dressed up but I never slack shit
So good, man I feel like I could be the 8th wonder of the world
And the 9th is on the track bitch
On track 'til I go hoarse
Hear my voice, and they pray that they never hear the chorus
Cause thinking logical to me was illogical
So I took impossible and turned it into optical
Seen blood, sweat and tears like a locker room
But you should take a look at where it got us to
We grind so when we shop out we cop out, like precincts
Even if it's not out, bring the whole stock out
We ain't on the court but everything is getting boxed out
Got it on lock, you just locked out
Skinny jeans, but a nigga still hood
I bet they thought they'd never see a Big gone good
But I swear to god my biz bad boy
And that's word to my nigga bad boy
Saw Puff, I was finna' speak
Nigga turn around and he recognise me
Damn, now that's what the fuck you call dedication
Get money, you still waiting on your reparations
Weight of the world, I lift without preparation
And it's time to make a real nigga separation

[Hook]

[Verse 3 (Kenn Starr)]
I used to be the most humble until
I figured out that it don't matter for real
Now I'm arrogant
Ill as a blood born pathogen to the killed
The reason why they had to give me a deal
Because I'm gettin it in
Look this the joint that could get me the spins
You get the point? Listen this what it is
Here's the lesson
I'm a force to be reckoned with
Why would you question it man?
Of course it's a definite
Enforce, I'm elegant and
You're soft and you're delicate
You should have a flower logo
My power awesome like Austin Powers with his mojo
Crossed them powers or devoured in a heartbeat
Sharper than sharpies
I'm sharper than shark teeth
Start beef bigger then your spouse
Should be harder to find
Than diggin' in your couch, looking for your car keys
Give it back with a sensitive mouth and some hard knees
From gettin' the jimmy like a car thief is
Wale and Ken Starr, we
Outt'a your league
Get grand slam fans out of they seats
Let's get paper, and 
caked up
Like six layers of thick make-up
On the self-conscious chick over-compensating for A-Cups

[Hook]

[Outro (Mike Posner)]
Ohhh, wait 'til I get back to campus
Everybody and their momma gon' chant this
I'm gon' make a pretty big sandwich
