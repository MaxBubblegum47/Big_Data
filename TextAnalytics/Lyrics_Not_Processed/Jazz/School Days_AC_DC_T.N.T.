[Verse 1]
Up in the mornin', out to school
The teacher is teaching the golden rule
American history, practical math
You're studying hard and you're hoping to pass
You're working your finger right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

"Ring, ring", goes the bell
The cook in the kitchen's ready to sell
But you're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you get time to eat
Well, back in the classroom, open your books
Ooh, the teacher don't know how mean she looks

[Chorus]
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
As soon as 3 o'clock rolls around
And ya lay your burden down
Throw down your books and out of your seat
You go down the hallway, into the street
And you're tryin' to forget just where you been
You find a juke joint, you go in
You drop the coin right into the slot
You gonna have something that's really hot (like me, girl)
With the one you love, you're makin' romance
All day long, been wantin' to dance
And ya feel the music from head to toe
It's round, and round, and round we go

[Chorus]
Long live rock and roll (x6)

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Rock, rock, rock and roll (x12)
