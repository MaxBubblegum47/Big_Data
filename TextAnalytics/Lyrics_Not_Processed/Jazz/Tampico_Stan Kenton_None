I, Tampico, Tampico, on the Gulf of Mehico
Tampico, Tampico, down in Mehico

You buy a beautiful shawl
A souvenir for Aunt Flo
Authentic Mexican yarn
Made in Idaho

I, Tampico, Tampico, on the Gulf of Mehico
Tampico, Tampico, down in Mehico

The senoritas, they waive, when you arrive at the dock
The native costumes they wear
Are slacks and bobby socks

I, Tampico, Tampico, on the Gulf of Mehico
Tampico, Tampico, down in Mehico

You buy some pottery there
To beat the luxury tax
You find that when you get home
They sell it cheaper at Sachs

I, Tampico, Tampico, on the Gulf of Mehico
Tampico, Tampico, down in Mehico

You ask a Mexican band
To play a rumba-down-dare
He turns and says to the boys
"Hey, fellas, dig that square!"

I, Tampico, Tampico, on the Gulf of Mehico
Tampico, Tampico, down in Mehico

Down in Mehico
