Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
The days are getting shorter, I noticed
Seems like time is movin' fast forward while I'm in slow motion
Losing loved ones with really no one to cope with
It's cool, my third and my fourth eye open
Man, I dodged the cell but still locked on my cell
I never thought I'd see the day my mom wouldn't agree with Oprah and Gayle
Myra [?] was my peace and Heaven on Earth and living Hell
Who gave me everything but never took anything for herself
Imagine '06 Impala with zero mileage
Seventeen, baggy clothes, not like Billie Eilish
Some niggas grow up and not old, they still as childish
Demons wearin' masks as my friends, they favorite disguises
But niggas not gon' forget about me like niggas forgot 'bout how Harriet was supposed to be on top of that twenty dollars
Dog, my life was seen out of Casa Blanca
You got it wrong, I'm the monster
Burning Man, ayahuasca
My check got no diagnostics
You disappear in the D like you Jimmy Hoffa
I-, yeah
