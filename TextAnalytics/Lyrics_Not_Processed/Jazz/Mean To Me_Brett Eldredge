[Verse 1]
If I could be the reason your hair's a mess
The bass drum beatin way down deep in your chest
If I could be the voice on your radio
Then I could be your long ride home

[Verse 2]
If mine could be the name that changes yours
The wine in your glass, the swing on your porch
The dollar in your pocket and the peaceful in your sleep
Then I'd be what you mean to me

[Chorus]
Standing here, watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low, dancing slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me

[Verse 3]
If I could be the fire in your firefly
The cool in the rain, the spark in your eye
The answer to your prayer
And the faith that sets you free
Then I'd be what you mean to me

[Chorus]
Standing here, watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low, dancing slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me
What you mean to me

[Bridge]
And oh, all of this talking makes you laugh
But I've gotta let you know
Just how I feel while i'm

[Chorus]
Standing here, watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low, dancing slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me
What you mean to me

[Outro]
Yeah, if falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me
Be what you mean to me
Ohhhhh, be what you mean
What you mean, what you mean
What you mean to me, mmm-mmm
