[Intro]
To lead a better life I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Bridge]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Verse 3]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Bridge]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

[Verse 3]
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Outro]
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
