[Intro]
Sykes, Sykes

[Chorus: Headie One]
Top floor penthouse
I reminisce just once in a while
Q and Q for free
Everybody getting high when I come to the town
I was locked down down South
Had t'ugs tryna tell me ’come to the mount'
Had a couple months 'til I’m out

[Verse 1: Headie One]
Just three months later, had a nine in that presser
And it come straight out that blender
I was out 'ere playin' catch up
Cah I know that my timin' is precious
How many times did I do that fast lane?
Reach that junction, take that exit?
It could've been wrap when I throw this twenty
But it got spent on a sawn off Trenton
Get yourself caught on the lack
No one can't save him
You're gonna see a doctor, who?
David Tennant
Four long kickin'
Swear down this one here ain’t from Tekken
Caught me a suttin’ and it got left leakin'
I done it just like my pendant
This black blade, that’s my best friend, that's my best friend
And all the fiends know about the bando, that's their entrance
Face-to-face with judge
But I'm thinkin’ no way that that's my sentence
Do it for bro cah he do it for me
That's my bredrin

[Chorus: Headie One]
Top floor penthouse
I reminisce just once in a while
Q and Q for free
Everybody getting high when I come to the town
I was locked down down South
Had t'ugs tryna tell me 'come to the mount'
Had a couple months 'til I'm out

[Verse 2: Bandokay]
Bro got a couple months 'til he's out
No doubt, Bando, man do it and bounce
This Bad B's comin' qway from South
Said she loves Bando and SJ, that's clout
Jump out, creep up like a mouse
But bro's too fast, he wan' scream and shout
Bring smoke to the dance, go bow
Have mouth and watch me back it from my pouch
Ouch, smoke on me, I got it
My bro got it too but he's high off loud
If I pull up, don't be in the crowd
Bandokay, bad yute from a child
The opp boys know gang go wild
And my fam telling me that I make them proud
Year 9, school times, weren't allowed
I would've have my Rambo like man does now
This sweet one wants Nandos now
On my line said she wants to take Bando out
I ain't leavin' the bando now
Trap boy, Bando, I'm a bando child
Swing that, got my Rambo out
Put a hand on Mango, man take him out
Man break it down, man chase him down
And pray that he don't make it out

[Chorus: Headie One]

[Verse 3: Double Lz]
Free SJ, pray he beats his trial
I swear I got beef with the Mali's
Cah they're tryna take over the town
Spin-ting spins like a merry-go-round
This brown skin brucks her back, she's from South
Two got shh in a week, like, how?
Normal procedure, load that beater
Creep up then you hear click-clack-bow
Double Lz, I'm classed as bad
You can get chinged out your DSquared pants
SJ, my bro, my fam
I swear I can't wait 'til my broski lands
You don't want us to get this call
We're doing our duties in Transit vans
I was on them sides when my guys decamped
Jump out, shing-shaow, or you might get slapped
Smoke in the ride, man got it and my bro got it too
But he's high off the pack
Do it and dash, and pray I get back
Can't call no cab cah he's smarter than that
Phones at home, we don't do it for Snap
Free Boogie B, he got caught on the cam
Go and ask opps how they dislike man
I'll tell you for a fact that I'm know as a sav'

[Verse 4: SJ]
Ay, all eyes on me, all eyes on bro
Sweet one on me, she's winnin'
She don't know that my Rambo's twinnin'
Man stepped in the rave, smoked up and drillin'
Free Boogie B, he got bagged for a killin'
We're drillers and the opp boys keep on singin'
I'm in love with spinners, shotgun and swingers
Right back tryna boot these wingers
Smoke in the ride, man got it and my bro got it too
But he's high off fumes
If I slap off this pocket rocket
You won't hesitate to go hide in groups
Man lean and shoot
Bro off this roof, create a movie in the 2's
Ay, spin this coupe, bro, paigon, shoot
Slap man then head straight to the booth
SJ, I'm anti, I don't fuck with socials
Ching my man in his throat
He's singin' all shit, he ain't got no vocals
OFB, we ain't got no totals
Scorin' and scorin', and scoreboard's hopeful
OFB's tryna make it global
Cock it, jump out and watch bro-bro smoke you
No Snapchat, we don't do it for socials
