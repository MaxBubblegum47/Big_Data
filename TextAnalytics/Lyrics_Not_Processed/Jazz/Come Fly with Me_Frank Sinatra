[Verse 1]
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

[Verse 2]
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

[Chorus]
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

[Verse 3]
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

[Verse 3]
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
You just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly

[Outro]
Pack up, let's fly away
