[Intro]
You know everybody been waiting on that Baby, man
I mean, it's like ever since Baby on Baby dropped, man, like, you know (Ever since Baby on Baby dropped)
Ain't nobody drop shit 
(
Oh Lord, Jetson made another one
)
Let's go, hah

[Chorus]
I needed some shit with some bop in it (Let's go)
I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country
I finish the show and I hop in it
I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (Hot)

[Verse 1]
Oh, you asking for pictures with niggas? (Huh?)
What's your name? Get the fuck out the spot, nigga (Get the fuck)
Tryna figure which deal I'ma take (Uh-huh)
I woke up, couple mil' on my plate (Let's eat)
I'm investing in real and estate (Uh-huh)
I just went gave my mama a hundred (A hundred)
Probably won't hear me open my mouth 'less you hearin' me talkin' 'bout finding some money (Let's go)
As soon as I found it, I flipped that (Flip)
I'm a little bit different, they get it (They dig)
Know I'm stiff on a bitch and she dig it
Tryna find out why Baby ain't all in her mentions (Hah)
No, she ain't get no DM from me (Bitch)
This rich nigga dick, it ain't free
She be throwin' that ass, yeah, she good at it
Turn around when we fuck, make her look at it (Uh, she like, hah)

[Chorus]
I needed some shit with some bop in it (Let's go)
I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it (Woo, okay)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country
I finish the show and I hop in it (Yeah)
I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (Hot, let's go)

[Verse 2]
I'm unorthodox than a motherfucker
Ayy, when you gon' switch the flow? I thought you'd never ask
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me
And ain't 'bout what the fuck they be rappin' 'bout with they lil' scary ass (Hah)
But to each his own, nigga (Huh)
If you like it, I love it, no biggie (No big)
That boy say he get money, oh, really?
How much they just cut you a check for? A milli'
I'm going back to Cali like Biggie (Go back)
'Bout to go get a pound just to smoke (I smoke)
They told me to come work on my album
I'm tryna go find out the price on a boat (Okay)
My lil' bitch act like Megan Thee Stallion
She ghetto and nasty, she drivin' the boat (Drive the boat)
All this shit that they makin' be boring
Play me something to bop while I ride with the pole
Here you go (Uh, oh, hah, okay)

[Chorus]
I needed some shit with some bop in it (Let's go)
I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country
I finish the show and I hop in it
I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (I'm hot)

[Interlude]
Like, this shit feel like, you know
The sophisticated ratchet hoes, you know
The ones that go to work by day, then, you know
Dance in the mirror by night (Hah)

[Chorus]
I needed some shit with some bop in it (Okay, let's go)
I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country
I finish the show and I hop in it
I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly
I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (I'm hot)

[Outro]

Tryna figure which deal I'ma take (Uh-huh)
