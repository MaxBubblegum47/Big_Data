[Intro]
Black suede, don't mean you're good for me
Black suede, just brings your mystery
I want to be inside of you
But you're black and I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
You're a smooth dancer
But it's alright
Because I'm a freelancer
And you can never break me though you try
To make me think you're magical

[Verse 1]
Baby, you're the one who can never see the sun
Because it don't shine nightly
Don't you look at me because I'm going to shake free
You'd better hang on tightly
You want to rule the world, but you're acting like a girl
Who's got a false pregnancy
You've swollen up inside with nothing but your pride
And yet you keep on dancing
Black suede, don't waste your time on me
Black suede, I sense your mockery
I tried to go along with you
But you're black and I know just what to do

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I think you're crazy, your two-timing ways
They don't bother me none
You'd better do it right because one day or night
I'm going to walk to freedom
You know I loved you once and I want to love again
But you don't give nothing
You can see it in my eyes so you've got to realize
Baby, I am not bluffing
Black suede, don't waste your time on me
Black suede, don't bring me misery
I tried to be inside of you
But you're black and now I know what to do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Baby, you're the one who can never see the sun
Because it don't shine nightly
Don't you look at me because I'm going to shake free
You'd better hang on tightly
You know I loved you once and I want to love again
But you don't give nothing
You can see it in my eyes so you've got to realize
Baby, I am not bluffing
Baby, you can rock'n'roll
But you can never show your soul, smooth dancer
