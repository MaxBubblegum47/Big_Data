Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me
Starlight and dewdrops are awaiting thee
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day
Led by the moonlight have all passed away

Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song
List while I woo the with soft melody
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng

Beautiful dreamer awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer awake unto me!

Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelei
Over the streamlet vapors are borne
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn

Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart

Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
