[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why do you look so familiar?
I could swear that I have seen your face before
I think I like that you seem sincere
I think I'd like to get to know you a little bit more

[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something more
Life's worth living for

[Chorus]
Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do, just keep on laughin'
One thing's true, there's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
How do you always have an opinion?
And how do you always find the best way to compromise?
We don't need to have a reason
We don't need anything, we're just wasting time

[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something more
Life's worth living for

[Chorus]
Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do, just keep on laughin'
One thing's true, there's always a brand new day
Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do, just keep on laughin'
One thing's true, there's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

[Bridge]
Find yourself, 'cause I can't find you
Be yourself, who are you?
Find yourself, 'cause I can't find you
Be yourself, who are you?

[Chorus]
Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do, just keep on laughin'
One thing's true, there's always a brand new day
So you go and make it happen
Do your best, just keep on laughin'
I'm telling you, there's always a brand new day
Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do, just keep on laughin'
One thing's true, there's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day
