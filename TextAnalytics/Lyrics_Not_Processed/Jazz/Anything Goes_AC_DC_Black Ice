[Verse 1]
Got a taste of a rocking band
Standing there holding out your hand
Better lock up all your doors
She's like a spinning dynamo

[Pre-Chorus]
They're handing out the token prize
Giving you a brand new ride

[Chorus]
There she goes, she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes, she goes

[Verse 2]
Banging drums, rockin' on all fours
Heavy tune rockin', play it loud
You know she blown away all the others
You'll never let it up, take it on all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You better razzle-dazzle on that stage
Keep a-rocking on all through the night

[Chorus]
There she goes, she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes, she goes
Hey, hey, hey

[Bridge]
A heavy rocking tune is playing
Playing as the night rolls on
Sneaking off with her Romeo
Where she goes, nobody knows

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
A heavy rocking tune is playing
On a fine new color T.V
Sneaking over, creepy-crawly
Never let it up to take it on through the night

[Chorus]
There she goes, she goes
And nobody knows
There she goes, she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes, she goes
And nobody knows
Where she goes, she goes
Nobody knows
Where she goes, she goes
