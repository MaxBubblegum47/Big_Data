[Verse 1]
Mary, you don't know
How much you mean to me
If you did you'd never
Ever make me feel this way
Mary, you don't know
How much I care for you
If you did I'd know you
Wouldn't make me hurt this way

[Refrain]
Now I realize you may
Not feel the same for me
Or are you trying to
Hide how much you care
Have you thought
About how hard this is for me
To live in this
One sided love affair

[Verse 2]
Mary, you don't know
How much I feel for you
If you did you'd never
Ever make me hurt this way
For you have to know I care, baby
Cause everything I've ever said or done
Should let you know that you're the one
Hmmm...

[Refrain]
Now you have to know you're
More than just a friend to me
Are you using me or are you just don't aware
Mary, can't you see that this is hard for me
To live in this one-sided love affair

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Now you know that in your heart
You feel the same for me, baby
You're just trying to hide how much you care
Oh, let me in your heart or just let me be
But put an end to this one-sided love affair...
