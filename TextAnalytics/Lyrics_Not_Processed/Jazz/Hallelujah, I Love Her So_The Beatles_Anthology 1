[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby, and I love her so
And every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so

[Verse 2]
When I call her on the telephone
She says, "Baby, I'm all alone"
Before the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door

[Verse 3]
Every evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and then she holds me tight
"Hey baby, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I just love that chick so
