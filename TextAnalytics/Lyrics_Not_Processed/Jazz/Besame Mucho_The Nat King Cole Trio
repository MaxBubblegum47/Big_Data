Bésame, bésame mucho
Each time I cling to your kiss, I hear music divine
Bésame mucho
Hold me my darling and say that you'll always be mine
This joy is something new
My arms enfolding you
Never knew this thrill before
Whoever thought I'd be
Holding you close to me
Whispering "It's you I adore"
Dearest one
If you should leave me
Each little dream would take wing, and my life would be through
Bésame mucho
Love me forever and make all my dreams come true
Bésame mucho
Bésame mucho
This joy is something new
My arms enfoldong you
Never knew this thrill before
Whoever thought I'd be
Holding you close to me
Whispering "It's you I adore"
Dearest one
If you should leave me
Each little dream would take wing, and my life would be through
Bésame mucho
Love me forever and make all my dreams come true
Bésame mucho
Bésame mucho
