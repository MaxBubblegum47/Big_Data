Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over
If I never have a cent
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover has crossed over
If I never, never have a cent
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
With gold dust at my feet
On a sunny, sunny side of the street
On a sunny, sunny side of the street
