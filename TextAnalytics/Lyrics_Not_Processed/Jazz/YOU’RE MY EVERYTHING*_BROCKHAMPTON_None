[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Who finna point me in the right direction?
Every day I feel my mistakes are a sign from heaven
I wanna move back to the block and get right back to seven
Drug dealers, candy paint, and chop and screw the message
I stay truer than true
I’m feelin’ bluer than blue
I wonder what would I do if I ain’t have me a group
Baby boy, look at you, why you trippin’ off of school?
You should feel like a troop for the days you had to do

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You’re my everything, my everything, yah
