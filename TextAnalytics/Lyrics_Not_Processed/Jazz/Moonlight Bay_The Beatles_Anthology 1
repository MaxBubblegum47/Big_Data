[Verse 1]
We were sailing along (Twist and shout)
On Moonlight Bay (Ooh)
We could hear the voices singing (I like it!)
They seemed to say (Keep on, Bongo)
You have broken my heart (Oh, twist and shout)
So go away

(Are the Beatles gone?
No, they're here
Oh)

[Verse 2]
With you big, far, hairy legs
On Moonlight Bay
On Moonlight Bay

[Outro]
Ooohhh
Yeah!
Ha ha!
