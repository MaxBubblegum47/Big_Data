Some day when I'm awfully low
And the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
You're lovely with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you look tonight
With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
And your laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
You're lovely and never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it
'Cause I love you just the way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
