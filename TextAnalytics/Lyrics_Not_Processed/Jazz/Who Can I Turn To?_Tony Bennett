Who can I turn to
When nobody needs me
My heart wants to know
And so I must go
Where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way
After the day
The darkness will hide me
And maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter
With you I could learn too
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away
And maybe tomorrow (Maybe tomorrow)
I'll find what I'm after (I'll find what I'm after)
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter
With you I can learn too
With you on a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away
