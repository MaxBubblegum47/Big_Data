Love is like a never-ending melody
Always have compared it to a symphony
A symphony conducted by the lighting of the moon
But our song of love is slightly out of tune
Once your kisses raised me to a fever pitch
Now the orchestration doesn't seem so rich
Seems to me you've changed the tune we used to sing
Like the bossa nova, love should swing
We used to harmonize, two souls in perfect time
Now the lyrics and the melody don't even rhyme
For you forgot the melody our hearts would always croon
And so what good's a heart that's slightly out of tune
Tune your heart to mine the way it used to be
Join with me in harmony and sing a song of loving
We've got to be together and before too long
There'll be no desafinado
When you give your heart  to me completely
Then you won't be slightly out of tune
You'll sing along with me

There'll be no desafinado
When you give your heart  to me completely
You won't be slightly out of tune
You'll sing along with me
