Forget your troubles
Come on get happy
You better chase all you cares away
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
Get ready for the judgement day
The sun is shining
Come on get happy
The lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
We're going to the promise land
We're heading across the river
Wash your sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side
Forget your troubles
Come on get happy
You better chase all you cares away
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
Get ready for the judgement day
Forget your troubles
Come on get happy
Chase your cares away
Hallelu get happy
Before the judgement day
The sun is shining
Come on get happy
The lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
We're gonna be going to the promise land
We're heading across the river
Wash your sins away in the tide
It's quiet and peaceful on the other side
Forget your troubles
Get happy
Your cares fly away
Shout halleluja
Get happy
Get ready for your judgement day
Come on get happy
Chase your cares away
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy
Get ready for the judgement day
The sun is shining
Come on get happy
The lord is waiting to take your hand
Halleluja
Come on get happy
We're going to the promise land
We're heading across the river
Wash your sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side

You better chase all your cares away
Shout halleluja
Come on get happy

For the judgement day
