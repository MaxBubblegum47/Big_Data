[Frank Sinatra]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes "ah"

[Frank Sinatra]
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes
 
 "ooh"

[Frank Sinatra]
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

[Frank Sinatra]
Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see
(doesn't see)

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
Ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
O seu balançado mais que um poema
A coisa mais linda que eu j vi passar..

[Frank Sinatra]
Ooh, but I watch her so sadly

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Ah, Porque tudo to triste

[Frank Sinatra]
Yes, I would give my heart gladly

[Frank Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

[Frank Sinatra]
Tall, tan, young, lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Por causa do amor

[Frank Sinatra]
She just doesn't see

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Nem olha para mim

[Frank Sinatra]
She never sees me

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Por causa do amor
