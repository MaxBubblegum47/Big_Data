[Verse 1]
Wide awake
Won't you give me space
Take a holiday
Take a break... down
It’s enough
That we never touch
Is it even love or con-ve-nience?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't listen when you run your mouth (Run your mouth)
Try to listen when I spell it out (Spell it out)
Another story I could live without
Another reason I've been having doubts
Guess I’m gonna have to spell it out

[Chorus]
ISOU
I'm so over you
ISOU
I'm so over you

[Verse 2]
I don't know what's inside your phone
Spend my nights alone
But you're beside me
It's a trend
Everything depends on the mood you're in
What about me?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can’t listen when you run your mouth (Run your mouth)
Try to listen when I spell it out (Spell it out)
Another story I could live without
Another reason I’ve been having doubts
Guess I'm gonna have to spell it out

[Chorus]
ISOU
I’m so over you
ISOU
I'm so over you

[Bridge]
Always run your mouth (run your mouth)
Are you listen, listen, listening (spell it out)
Always having doubts (having doubts)
Better listen, listen, listen in (better spell it out)

[Chorus]
ISOU
I'm so over you
ISOU
I'm so over you
ISOU
I’m so over you
ISOU
I'm so over you

[Outro]
I'm so over you
You
You
