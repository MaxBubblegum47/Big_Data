My boy
I got so much love in my heart for him
That I really don't feel like me when he's not around
Yes, there are boys and there are boys
But he's a fine, fine boy
I wanna tell the world about the boy I love
Just the kind of guy I was dreaming of
He's so sincere when he holds me tight
And when I'm blue he makes me feel alright
Oh he's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And something tells me that we'll never part
He's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And he's fine, fine, fine
I know he's fine, fine, fine
I know he's a fine, fine boy
He can take me places and buy me things
But love is more important than a diamond ring
So all I wanna do is stay by his side
And take care of him and I'll be satisfied
Oh he's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And something tells me that we'll never part
He's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And he's fine, fine, fine
I know he's fine, fine, fine
I know he's a fine, fine boy
Musical interlude
Oh he's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And something tells me that we'll never part
He's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And he's fine, fine, fine
I know he's fine, fine, fine
I know he's a fine
My boy
He's a fine, fine, super fine boy
Fine, fine boy
Fine, fine boy
