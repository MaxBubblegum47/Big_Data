[Part I: Palace]

[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Ayy, y’all ain't never been to a party before?

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
I don’t know what to say
But I couldn't let you get away
I was admiring your pretty face
Come to my house you can get away
I got a pool
A tennis court if you wanna play
A couple ramps if you wanna skate
Wings on my back if you wanna fly away

[Chorus: Syd]
Come into my palace, girl
Everything you’ve ever wanted
Come into my palace, girl
Even if you don’t wanna stay
It’s okay
Come into my palace
Come into my palace, girl

[Break: Tyler, the Creator]
Yeah, you havin’ a good time tonight y’all?
I said, we havin’ a good time tonight y’all?
We haven't had a party like this in a while
Yeah it’s that new Internet right here
It’s called “Palace,” aight?
Groove, now let’s rock

[Verse 2: Syd]
I don’t know what to say
But I know I had to get a taste
Pretty girl, it’s a pretty day
Come to my house, you can get away
I got a view
A little weed if you wanna blaze
Couple games if you wanna play
Wings on my back if you wanna fly away

[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Come into my palace, girl
Everything you’ve ever wanted
Come into my palace, girl
Even if you don’t wanna stay
It’s okay
Come into my palace
Come into my palace, girl

[Break: Tyler, the Creator]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Y'all havin’ a good time tonight y’all?
Hahaha, yeah, yo

(Hell yeah)
Can I get a “hell yeah?”
(Hell yeah)
Can I get a “fuck that shit?”
(Fuck that shit)
Can I get a “whoop that trick?”
(Whoop that trick)
Hahahahahaha aw man, hope y'all get home safe tonight, aight?
No drinkin' and drivin'

Witch' yo’ broke ass, hahahaha
Aw man, I’m happy y'all came out tonight
Feel good, feel real good
Speakin’ of that listen, listen, listen

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Syd just sent me some new Internet shit that I’m not supposed to play. Alright? So I'ma play it real low 'cause we not supposed to hear this shit. And then when-when I play it, don't tell nobody 'cause I’ll get in trouble, so I'ma play this song real low. This a world exclusive

[Part II: Curse]

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Baby, you make me believe
I could fall in love at first
Sight, how you stunned me with your
Body, I'm under your curse
Baby, I'm under your curse
Baby, I'm under your curse

Love is such a sweet thing
Maybe we should try it out
See what love is all about

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Baby, you make me believe
I could fall in love at first
Sight, how you stunned me with your
Body, I'm under your curse
Baby, I'm under your curse
Baby, I'm under your curse

Sight, how you stopped me with your (Ohh)
Body, I'm under your curse
(Don’t worry, darling)
(Hey) Baby, I'm under your curse
(You know I’d try, but there's something about you)
Baby, I'm under your curse
(Maybe, maybe it’s all meant to be)
Baby, I'm under your curse
