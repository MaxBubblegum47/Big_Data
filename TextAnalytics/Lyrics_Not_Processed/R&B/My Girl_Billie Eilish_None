[intro]
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da-ba-da
Mmm, mmm

[verse 1]
My girls bein' sus, she was shady enough
But now she's just a shadow
My girl loves her friends
Like i love my split ends
And i that, i mean she cuts them off
(what?)

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
She don't love me like she promised
My girl, my girl, my girl
She ain't no women and sure as hell ain't honest

[verse 2]
My girl's bein' sus and she don't know how to cuss
She just sounds like she's tryna be her father (who are you?)
My girl's an ugly crier but she's such a pretty liar
And by that, i mean she said she'd change

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
She don't love me like she promised
My girl, my girl, my girl
She ain't no women and sure as hell ain't honest

[bridge]
My girl, my-my girl, my friends
I love-love, i-i love-love my split ends
My girl (love, love, love, love, love, love)
My-my girl (love, love, love, love, love, love)
My girl, my (love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
(alright, dude, go trip over a knife)

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
She don't love me like she promised
My girl, my girl, my girl
She ain't no women and sure as hell ain't honest

[outro: billie eilish]
You want me to be yours? well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours? well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
