[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
Fireballs falling out, out of the sky, sky
Ricocheting off the brain into the eye, eye
It's the fate we created in our mind, mind
If we stay, we'll be hated
Looks like we're the only lovers left alive

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
We're the only lovers left alive, left alive
Clearly we've been running all our lives to survive
We're the only lovers left alive, look alive
We're the only lovers left
We're the only lovers left alive

[Post-Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
If they don't believe us, they'll keep us from freedom
And being beings of light, beacons of light
If they don't believe us, they'll keep us from freedom
And being beings of light, beacons of light

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
Fireballs falling out, out of the sky, sky
Ricocheting off the brain into the eye, eye
It's the fate we created in our mind, mind
If we stay, we'll be hated

[Refrain: Jhené Aiko]
Tell me how you love me again
Tell me how you fell often, often, often
Tell me how you love me again
Tell me how you fell often, often, often
Tell me how you fell, tell me how you feel
Tell me how you fell, tell me how you feel
Tell me how you fell, tell me how you feel
Tell me how you fell, tell me how you feel
We're the only lovers left alive

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
We're the only lovers left alive, left alive
Clearly we've been running all our lives to survive
We're the only lovers left alive, look alive
We're the only lovers left
We're the only lovers left alive

[Post-Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
If they don't believe us, they'll keep us from freedom
And being beings of light, beacons of light
If they don't believe us, they'll keep us from freedom
And being beings of light, beacons of light

[Verse 3: Jhené Aiko & TWENTY88]
Yeah, so sweet
I guess we the roses that grew from concrete
I can't even picture you without me
That's too sad to see like a pic of Mobb Deep
You never lied, never gave me bad vibes
And we in over our head like we getting baptized
And that's a feeling money can't buy
Baby girl, you matter to me like black lives
I've been daydreaming these nightmares
Of me waking up and you not there
So crazy, my lady, I look at you, I wanna have a hundred babies
Raising hell 'til we see Heaven gates
We gon turn 100 when it's 2088
And I'ma look at you and say, "Ay"

[Bridge: Jhené Aiko]
We're the only lovers left alive
Under the sun
I'm drunk, baby, I'm drunk
I'm drunk, baby, I'm drunk
We're the only lovers left alive

[Break]
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Time for backwards skate
Couples only, couples only
If you don't got a lil bae to play, get off the floor
Couples skate backwards, lovers only
It's the end of the world, y'all, it's the end
This is for lovers only
Come on, 1, 1-2, 1, 1-2, 1
Back, yeah, slow, uh, slow, back

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
We're the only lovers left alive
We're the only lovers left alive, left alive
Clearly we've been running all our lives to survive
We're the only lovers left alive, look alive
We're the only lovers left
We're the only lovers left alive
We're the only lovers left alive, left alive
Clearly we've been running all our lives to survive
We're the only lovers left alive, look alive
We're the only lovers left
We're the only lovers left alive

[Refrain: Jhené Aiko]
Tell me how you love me again
Tell me how you fell often, often, often
Tell me how you love me again
Tell me how you fell often, often, often
Tell me how you fell, tell me how you feel
Tell me how you fell, tell me how you feel
Tell me how you fell, tell me how you feel
Tell me how you fell, tell me how you feel
We're the only lovers left alive

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
We're the only lovers left alive
We're the only lovers left alive, left alive
Clearly we've been running all our lives to survive
We're the only lovers left alive, look alive
We're the only lovers left
We're the only lovers left alive
