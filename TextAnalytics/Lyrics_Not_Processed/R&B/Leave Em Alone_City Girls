[Intro: PnB Rock]
Hitmaka
Ow
I see
Girl, you out here tryna be my wifey
I'ma eat that pussy like it’s ice cream
Bet you ain't met a nigga like me

[Verse 1: Layton Greene]
No need to say what I been through
He already know what I'm into
He be reading my mind like it’s simple
Got him banging my line like it's his too
Never gotta worry 'bout no issues
He pay it on time when the rent due
Made him ice out my neck and the wrist too
Hold down your pussy and your pistol (
Let him know, girl
)

[Pre-Chorus: PnB Rock]
I see
Girl, you out here tryna be my wifey
I'ma eat that pussy like it's ice cream
Bet you ain't met a nigga like me

[Chorus: Layton Greene]
I can't leave 'em alone
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin’ me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can’t leave 'em alone (Can’t leave 'em alone)
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin' me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can't leave ’em alone

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Why you tryna leave me alone?
I'm a D-boy, you know that come with doin' you wrong
Nah, I'm playin', you should know that we been in this too long
And all your friends really wish that they was on what we on
Girl, you know I got that deep stroke, that heart skip a beat stroke
That put us both to sleep stroke, forget about him, he broke
Serious as they come, I don't play no jokes
Middle of the winter, I'll give that ass a heatstroke, yeah (
Let 'em know
)

[Pre-Chorus: PnB Rock]
I see
Girl, you out here tryna be my wifey
I'ma eat that pussy like it's ice cream
Bet you ain't met a nigga like me

[Chorus: Layton Greene]
I can't leave 'em alone
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin' me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can't leave 'em alone (Can't leave 'em alone)
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin' me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can't leave 'em alone

[Verse 3: Yung Miami]
Jackrabbit when he put the dick in it
How you nut and you barely put the tip in it?
Sixty seconds, got him gone, that's a quick minute
He ain't never felt some pussy with some grip in it
Hair done, nails done like a bad bitch
Broke niggas turned me to a savage
I can't fuck him if he average
Way more bad than your last bitch (Period)

[Chorus: Layton Greene]
I can't leave 'em alone
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin' me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can't leave 'em alone (Can't leave 'em alone)
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin' me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can't leave 'em alone

[Outro: Hitmaka]
I swear we not tryin'
Ayy, yo, 4Rest, let's go grab homegirl from the front, you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause, uh
