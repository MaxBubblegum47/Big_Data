[Intro]
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Mmm-mmm-mmm

[Chorus]
A woman needs a love just like you do, hoo
Don't kid yourself into thinkin' that she don't
She can fool around just like you do, hoo
Unless you give her all the lovin' she wants

[Verse 1]
Don't the mistake of thinkin' old fashioned
Times have changed from yesterday
But no longer will those old double standards
Be accepted by the women of today
So when you think you're foolin' her
She just might be foolin' you
Remember if you can do it
She can too

[Chorus]
Because a woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don't kid yourself into thinking that she don't
She can fool around just like you do, hoo
Unless you give her all the lovin' she wants

[Verse 2]
When her eyes are beggin' for affection
Don't put her off, don't make her wait
Don't try to give her that worn out excuse
About being tired and workin' late
I tell you one day you'll come home
Early from work
Open up the door
And get your feelings hurt

[Chorus]
Because she needs it, yeah (Just like you do)
A woman's got to have it, whoa, yeah, just like you
And if you're smart, mmm, (Just like you do)
You better stop foolin' around, hey, hey
Cause she will too, oh

[Interlude]
Just like you do, hoo
Thinking that she don't, hoo, ooh
Just like you, hoo
Now an example to you

[Bridge]
Is by the time poor Jack
Returned up the hill
Somebody else
Had been lovin' Jill

[Chorus]
A woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don't kid yourself into thinkin' that she don't
She can fool around (Yeah), she will fool around so
You better take out some insurance and be sure she won't
Give her the love, mmm (Just like you do), yeah
That sweet, sweet love, she wants it just like you
'Cause she can fool around (Just like you do) just like she will fool around (Hoo)
With you or without you, just like you do

[Outro]
A woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don't kid yourself into thinking that she don't, hoo, ooh
She can fool around just like you, hoo
A woman needs it just like you
