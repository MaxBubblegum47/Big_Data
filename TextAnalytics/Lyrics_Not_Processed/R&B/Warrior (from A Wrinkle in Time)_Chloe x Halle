[Verse 1: Halle]
Oh my darling I've been missing you for quite some time
So I'm gonna lift the oceans, just to see your eyes

[Chorus]
I could be a warrior, yes I am a warrior
There's no need to worry love
Look around it's glorious
Close your eyes and taste the sun
You know where to find me
(You know where to find!)

[Verse 2: Chloe]
Oh my darling I am getting closer, hold on tight
And I, know it hasn't been so easy
I'm fighting for my life

[Chorus]
I could be a warrior, yes I am a warrior
There's no need to worry love
Look around it's glorious
Close your eyes and taste the sun
You know where to find me
(I know where to find!)
And I know where to find you

[Post-Chorus]
Inside side the light!
Inside side the light!
Inside I'm alive
Inside side the light!
Inside side the light!
Inside side the light!
Inside I'm alive
Inside side the light!
Inside side the light!

[Bridge]
Almost there overcome my fear
I'll save the light in our lives
Just look deep inside to find you and I
Like stars in the sky will brighten the light
You know where to find me
(Oh! Oh! You know, you know where)
(I know where to find!)
And I know where to find you

[Post-Chorus]
Inside side the light!
Inside side the light!
Inside I'm alive
Inside side the light!
Inside side the light!
Inside side the light!
Inside I'm alive
Inside side the light!
Inside side the light!

[Outro]
I could be a warrior, yes I am a warrior
There's no need to worry love
Look around it's glorious
Close your eyes and taste the sun
You know where to find me
And I know where to find you
