[Verse 1]
It's perfect outside, it's like God let me dial up the weather
Got the whole crew here, I ain't seen some of them in forever
It's one of those 'never forget it; better stop and take it in' kind of scenes
Everything's just right, yeah, except for one thing

[Chorus]
You should be here
Standing with your arm around me here
Cuttin' up crackin' a cold beer
Sayin' cheers
Hey y'all, it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
You should be here
(You should be here)

[Verse 2]
You'd be takin' way too many pictures on your phone
Showin' 'em off to everybody that you know back home
And even some you don't, yeah
They say now you're in a better place
And I would be too if I could see your face

[Chorus]
You should be here
Standin' with your arm around me here
Cuttin' up crackin' a cold beer
Sayin' cheers
Hey y'all, it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
Aw, you should be here

[Bridge]
You'd be lovin' this
You'd be freakin' out
You'd be smilin'
Yeah, I know you'd be all about
What's goin' on right here, right now
God, I wish somehow
You could be here
Aw, you should be here

[Chorus]
Yeah, this is one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
Aw, you should be here
(You should be here)
(You should be here)
You should be here
