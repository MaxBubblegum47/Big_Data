[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
She so good for me
Mr. good stuff, Mrs. good stuffin', good lovin'
Watch me pull up 'til I pull somethin' on a full stomach
Take her out to eat like, "I'm hungry if you're hungry"
Hoppin' it off, then droppin' her off
Then toppin' it off with a muah on her jaw
And a smack on the ass, and a call me tomorrow
And a walk to the door and a honk on the horn
Got Monica on my playlist and she on my bae list
But since I got a situation, I use imagination, alright

[Verse 2: Monica & 
Lil' Wayne
]
Baby, baby, baby, baby (
Tunechi
)
Can't no one come take me from my baby (
One, two, three, four
)
Like I can give my heart and all my time (
Alright
)
Gotta keep my lovin' on your mind (
Yeah
)

[Pre-Chorus: Monica & 
Lil' Wayne
]
Oh, you got me goin' (
Woo, I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'
)
So far and deep (
I'm deep, I'm deep, I'm deep
)
I can't control it (
No, I can't control it, control it, control it, control it
)
Meant to be together through the times

[Chorus: Monica]
'Cause you're just right for me (Baby, I)
Boy, you know your love's the best
And it's just right for me (Baby, I am sure)
And I don't care about your past
'Cause you're just right for me (Baby, I-I-I)
Just right for me, me-me, me (Baby, I know it)
And I don't care about your past, hey

[Verse 2: Monica & 
Lil' Wayne
]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
It's like you're always tryna keep me happy
So you know what a wife like me gon' do
Got me thankin' on the two that made you (
Thank you, baby
)

[Pre-Chorus: Monica & 
Lil' Wayne
]
Oh, you got me goin' (
Woo, uh
) so far and deep (
So far, so deep
)
I can't control it (
I can't control it, no
)
Meant to be together through the times (
Meant to be, ayy
)

[Chorus: Monica]
'Cause you're just right for me (Baby, you know)
Boy, you know your love's the best (
The best, yeah
)
And it's just right for me (Baby, I will show you)
And I don't care about your past
'Cause you're just right for me

[Bridge: Monica]
You know it
Oh, oh, you got my attention
Boy, you never lose 'cause you know I miss it (You know)
The things we do, my king, you're my best friend

[Chorus: Monica]
And it's just right for me (For me)
And I don't care about your past
'Cause you're just right for me (Just right for me)
Baby, I will show you
(Uh huh, just right for me)
Just right for me
Just right, my time
The only one in my life (Ohh, oh-oh)
Baby and you know it
Ooh, youâ€™re just right for me (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
Just right for me, oh
