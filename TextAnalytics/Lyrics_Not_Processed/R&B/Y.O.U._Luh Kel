[Intro]
Looney Tunes in your area
Bankroll Got It

[Chorus]
If I said I need you by my side, just stay close to me
Just keep on holding me, telling me you won't ever leave
I feel like somethin' inside me just keep controllin' me
But you take all the pain, I need your energy
I, I, I, I'm needin' you
I, I, know you see me through
I, I, I'll be there for you
I, I, I'll be there for you

[Verse 1]
It's a different feeling when all of the checks on (Yeah)
I'ma trap and I'ma trap until the pack gone (Yeah)
Sometimes I know I'm right but I feel wrong
When your arms not around me, I feel all alone
I feel like I'm pacin', chasin', hopin' I'ma make it (Yeah, yeah)
It's a lot inside my mind, my life been super crazy
Praying that one day my brother get up out of them cages
You was there for me, I swear that I'll be here for you

[Chorus]
If I said I need you by my side, just stay close to me
Just keep on holding me, telling me you won't ever leave
I feel like somethin' inside me just keep controllin' me
But you take all the pain, I need your energy
I, I, I, I'm needin' you
I, I, know you see me through
I, I, I'll be there for you
I, I, I'll be there for you

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been in my mind, I feel I'm faded
Every time you come around, my heart is racing
I'm grinding so hard, I gotta make it
But you told me it's coming, so I'm patient (Yeah, yeah)
I've been in my mind, I'm gone (Oh)
It might take some time, I'm strong
I need you by my side because I need you
And when you tell me I'm that nigga, boost my ego (Oh, oh-oh)
All the way to the stars like the aliens (Oh, oh-oh)
I know we ain't hit the top, but girl, we grazing it
When I look into your eyes, it's some amazing shit (It's amazing)
And girl, you're not in love just for the place I'm in

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I, I'm needin' you
I, I, know you see me through
I, I, I'll be there for you
I, I, I'll be there for you

[Chorus]
If I said I need you by my side, just stay close to me
Just keep on holding me, telling me you won't ever leave
I feel like somethin' inside me just keep controllin' me
But you take all the pain, I need your energy
I, I, I, I'm needin' you
I, I, know you see me through
I, I, I'll be there for you
I, I, I'll be there for you
I, I, I, I'm needin' you
I, I, know you see me through
I, I, I'll be there for you
I, I, I'll be there for you

[Outro]
I'll be there for you
I was there for you
Know you see me through
I, I, I'm needin' you
