Smiling face and loving eyes
But you keep on telling me all those lies
How'd you expect me to believe?
Honey, I ain’t that naive
Baby, I've got my eye on you
'Cause you do all the things I want you to
Stop your crying and dry your tears
I ain’t that wet behind the ears

And you can throw me lefts
And you can throw me rights
But where was you last night?
Beatin' around the bush

Wish I knew what's on your mind
And why you're being so unkind
Remember those nights we spent alone
Talking on the telephone?
Thoughts of you go through my brain
Told me that you felt the same
Don't say that you love me too
Tell me who would lie with you?

I was talking birds
And you was talking bees
Or was he down upon his knees?
Beatin' around the bush

You're the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're looking for
You've eaten your cake, you want some more
I'm gonna give you just a one more chance
Try to save our romance
Done everything I'm going to do
The rest is up to you

And you can chew it up
And you can spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beatin' around the bush

Chew it up
Spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beatin' around the bush
