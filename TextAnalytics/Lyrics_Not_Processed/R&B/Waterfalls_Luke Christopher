[Verse 1]
Yeah, last lie I told
All my feelings intact, I knew she wasn't sold
Think I'm such a romantic, she ain't been to a show
Better that way, she say, "Why?", I spit the perfect reply
She say to spare me the lines
Thought that I could just buy you and not spend the time
And now I'm stuck with my pride hurt, left me on my high horse
And I told you that I'd try more to give you what you need

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm saying, "Baby
Your doorstep's looking hella crazy"
There's flowers everywhere, girl
You said I don't know you at all

[Chorus]
Weekends in the mountains, in the mountains
Picnics under rainbows and rainbows
Kissing under waterfalls, that's not love
The flowers ain't working, when you gonna show up?
Throwing pennies in the fountain, in the fountain
Lying on my payroll, my payroll
Kissing under waterfalls, waterfalls, that's not love
Love is you and me, babe

[Post-Chorus]
I took a break, now I know it's not for sure (Oh, oh)
Yeah, known for a fact, yeah, I know it's not for sure (Love is you and me, babe)
Yeah, I took a break, I know love is not a show (Oh, oh)
Yeah, I took a break, I know love is

[Verse 2]
Yeah, just once a month I could put you first
Bury your sadness in Louis caskets, shit never works
First-class to Paris, it's just you and the wine
Told you I would be there, couldn't find you the time
I told myself that I gave you my all
But wasn't there when you needed me most
So I give you things, thought I filled that space
I thought that we were great

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm saying, "Baby
Your doorstep's looking hella crazy"
There's flowers everywhere, girl
You said I don't know you at all

[Chorus]
Weekends in the mountains, in the mountains
Picnics under rainbows and rainbows
Kissing under waterfalls, that's not love
The flowers ain't working, when you gonna show up?
Throwing pennies in the fountain, in the fountain
Lying on my payroll, my payroll
Kissing under waterfalls, waterfalls, that's not love
Love is you and me, babe

[Post-Chorus]
I took a break, now I know it's not for sure (Oh, oh)
Yeah, known for a fact, yeah, I know it's not for sure (Love is you and me, babe)
Yeah, I took a break, I know love is not a show (Oh, oh)
Yeah, I took a break, I know love is

[Outro]
All the moments that I had, yeah
Could've gave you something you ain't never had, yeah
Yeah, I don't know why I do what I do
But I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I really am this time
