Snippet

[Chorus ?]
Tell me that you love me once again
'Cause sometimes you try to pull me closer
And I think it might be pretend
So if you wanna love me 'til the end
I might need to hear it over and over
'Cause I get lonely in my head

[?]
And I
Get lost in time
And in the night
Without a friend
And only you
Can help me through
I'm scared to lose what we have

[Chorus ?]
So tell me that you love me once again
'Cause sometimes you try to pull me closer
And I think it might be pretend
So if you wanna love me 'til the end
I might need to hear it over and over
'Cause I get lonely in my head
