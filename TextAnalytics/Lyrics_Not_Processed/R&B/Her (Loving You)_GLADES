[Verse 1]
I can’t make you say my name when all you know is hers
You're falling for that someone else I know
I can’t make you feel this way, my hurt is sinking in
There's no way to change it for you

[Chorus]
My feelings go forever
You’re exactly what I needed
Even when we're breaking
I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you
Here we go again now
Running 'round in circles
I don’t care my heart aches
Cause I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you

[Verse 2]
I thought you would feel the same, your touch it said it all
But clearly you were quick to flaw, now I know
I thought you would make it right and slowly start to mend
This broken love affair of ours, but no

[Chorus]
My feelings go forever
You’re exactly what I needed
Even when we're breaking
I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you
Here we go again now
Running 'round in circles
I don’t care my heart aches
Cause I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you

[Bridge]
You stopped my heart
Made it an echo of
Time gone by
Pulling the strings again
You make me cry
You make me scream
But love is holding me to you

[Chorus]
My feelings go forever
You’re exactly what I needed
Even when we're breaking
I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you
Here we go again now
Running 'round in circles
I don’t care my heart aches
Cause I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you

(I'll be loving you, I'll be loving you)
(I'll be loving you, I'll be loving you)
