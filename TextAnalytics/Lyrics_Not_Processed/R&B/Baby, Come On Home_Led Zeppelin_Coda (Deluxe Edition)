[Verse 1]
There was a time, I used to call you on my very own
We were so happy woman, Talking for hours and hours on the telephone
Then one day, I set you up to walk right out of my life
Leaving me all by myself, All alone, to cry every night

[Chorus]
(Babe...) oooh, I want you to come back home yeah (come on home)
(oooh yeah) Sweet little girl (ooh yeah, been gone so long)
Been away so long

[Verse 2]
Now listen to me: I said I made up my mind
Woman when you left me there, oh
I was going to find another sweet lover
Who is going to feel all of my... cares
So I met a sweet little girl, Just about as nice as she could be, oh
I fell in love with that woman, But she turned around
And did the same thing again to me

[Chorus]
(Babe...) Baby, please come home (come on home) home yeah
I know, (you been gone too long) been away so long
(Babe...) I want you to please come home, oh (come on home...)

[Verse 3]
So I made up my mind, I going to crawl right back to you woman
I am going to plead and plead and plead, yeah, 'Till you are here by my side
I cannot even walk down the same old streets we used to walk down
Because I keep thinking about all the good times
Keep thinking about it, I want to make you mine

[Chorus]
Babe, babe, babe, please (come on home, yeah) (come on home)
(You have been gone too long)
