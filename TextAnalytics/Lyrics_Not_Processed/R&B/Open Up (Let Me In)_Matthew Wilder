Who's dancing up my stairway?
A strange voice echoes in the hall
Who's that knocking at my door?
I'm here all by myself, so
Who can that be so late at night?
You're sure it's me you're looking for

Open up
Let me in
Won't you open up?
Let me in

Mystique is my seduction
I don't ever stand a chance
Nothing matters to me more
Who keeps knocking?

Open up
Let me in
Won't you open up?
Let me in
Baby, open up
Let me in

Who's that knocking?
Who keeps knocking?
Who's that knocking?

A stranger is temptation
Sending shivers up my spine
Danger makes me feel alive

Open up
Let me in
Won't you open up?
Let me in
Baby, open up
Let me in
Won't you open up?
Let me in

Baby, open up
Let me in
Won't you open up?
Let me in
Baby, open up
Let me in
Won't you open up?
Let me in

Baby, open up
(Who keeps knocking?)
Let me in
(Who's that calling?)
Won't you open up?
(Who keeps knocking?)
Let me in
