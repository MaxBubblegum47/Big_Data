[Verse 1 - Sean Biggs]
I'm from the hard knock academy, automatically had to be
Carryin' automatics, sprayin' sporadic, inaccurate
Clips to the back of it, barrel cockin' immaculate
Learn to move packages in and out of Los Angeles
We savages, bustin' off rounds, sprayin' banana clips
Knockin pounds off 'em like Anna Nicole Smith
Shit, I'm in the hood, walkin' with choppers
Cockin' and poppin' at coppers, Glocks be talkin' like
Blockedie block, block
I probably popped Hoffa and possibly just forgot where I tossed 'em
This nigga's obnoxious, me and Top got your bitch in the cockpit
She want a pit stop, just see how the cock spit
These bosses deposit the profit, they watch as we cop it
On top of the ostrich and foxes (That's right)
I used to be a little bastard of stress
Now I'mma boss where I'm from
With Alaska on my chest (Yes!)

[Hook - Akon]
See I know you'll like my swagger
No strap when I come through
Chain hangin' like Ali Baba
Know me, ya know how I do

The way that I move, nigga
(Ya never gon' get it)
Cause I'm too smooth, nigga
(Ya never gon' get it)
I thought you knew, nigga
(Ya never gon' get it)
But you ain't got a clue, nigga
(Ya never gon' get it)

[Verse 2 - Topic]
Who in the hell left the gate open?
I put it down for the wild, wild west
Like the 1800s in 'em stage coaches
If I ain't strapped then my blade's pokin'
If it ain't a 600 big body, then the '64, honey, is spokin'
The drama spokesman, streets endorsed 'em
I rather be opening up my nine, then closed in my coffin
I'm from West Covina, this ain't Compton
Still money passed around like we takin' a offerin'
I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
When they see the sad happy faces, they know the drama's on
It's the west coast back at your front door
We up close and personal, we ain't done till the curtains close
Could be friend or foe, love it or hate it
I'm the king but I play with the aces
Run up to find out I keep it loaded like bases
Get wise and your mouth and knees need braces (Hey!)

[Hook - Akon]

[Verse 3 - Akon]
See when I walk through the door
I wonder why these fake niggas jackin' me for?
On display, like I came from the store, you know
I'm posin' like a mannequin in front of your ho

Up front block runnin' 50 deep now
Convicts surroundin' the whole compound
Cause you don't really want what you're starin' at
Clip full of bullets, don't mind sharin' that (That)

[Hook - Akon]
