[Verse 1]
I drink straight to my head
I went outside to smoke a cigarette
And I shattered my phone on the cement
But I don't give a fuck
Now I'm not making sense
I'm laughing at a joke that I don't get
I'm acting like these strangers are my friends
But I don't give a fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
Yelling at the DJ, "Bro, your shit is boring"
Doing things that I will not regret until the morning
Imma make it rain down, another round is on me
I'm just here for fun and I don't care about the money
(Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh oh oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?
Whoa, oh oh
We can do whatever
As long as we're together then we're gonna be alright
Don't leave, just wait
You can tell your friends that you're staying out late, singin'
Whoa, oh oh oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?

[Verse 2]
Alright, alright, finish your G & T
The Uber's here, so now it's time to leave
Hey, driver could you pass the AUX to me?
Go ahead and turn it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Head out of the window, you could call me shameless
Waving to my people now I'm acting like I'm famous
Tell him take the long way, we could see the sunrise
Damn, you look so pretty when that sunlight hits your blue eyes

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh oh oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?
Whoa, oh oh
We can do whatever
As long as we're together then we're gonna be alright
Don't leave, just wait
You can tell your friends that you're staying out late, singing
Whoa, oh oh oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?

[Refrain]
(For the night, for the night, oh yeah)
I drink straight to my head
I went outside to smoke a cigarette
And I shattered my phone on the cement
But I don't give a fuck
(Hey)

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh oh oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night? (stay together)
Whoa, oh oh
We can do whatever
As long as we're together then we're gonna be alright
Don't leave, just wait
You can tell your friends that you're staying out late, singing
Whoa, oh oh oh
Nothing lasts forever
But wouldn't it be nice to stay together for the night?
