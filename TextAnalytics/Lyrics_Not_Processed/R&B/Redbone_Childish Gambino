[Verse 1]
Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, ooh
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it

[Chorus]
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

[Verse 2]
Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, oh
You can have it, you can have it
If you need it, you better believe in something
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it, ah

[Chorus]
But stay woke (Stay woke)
Niggas creepin' (They be creepin')
They gon' find you (They gon' find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Gon' catch you sleepin', put your hands up now, baby)
Ooh, now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes
But stay woke (Ooh)
Niggas creepin' (They gon' find you)
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh (Gon' catch you, gon' catch you)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes

[Outro]
How'd it get so scandalous?
Oh, how'd it get so scandalous?
Oh, oh, baby you, how'd it get
How'd it get so scandalous?
How'd it get so scandalous?
But stay woke
But stay woke
