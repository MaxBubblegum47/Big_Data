[Verse 1]
Mother nature's been good to me
That's why I'm sitting in this cherry tree
But it's alright, it's alright
It's not so bad
I'm just a touch away
The shady lady
From shady lane
Is lying in my bed again
And it's alright
It feels good
It's not so bad
When she's just a touch away

[Chorus]
Nothing much
Is all I ask
And it's alright, ok yes
Light as a feather, oh yes
And just a touch away

[Verse 2]
Like a rosebud
When the sun is high
She opens up
Before my eyes
And the light falls
On her wet skin
It's alright
I'm just a touch away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Put a finger to her lips again
She cries with pleasure
Cries wih pain
And it's alright
It feels good
It's not so bad
We're just a touch away

[Chorus]
Nothing much
Is all I know
Not too fast
Not too slow
And it's alright
Soft as a feather
And just a touch away
