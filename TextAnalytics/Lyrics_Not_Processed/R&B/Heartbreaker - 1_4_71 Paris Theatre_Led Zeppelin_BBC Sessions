Hey fellas, have you heard the news
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long just watch an' see
How the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new but the face is same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

Well, it's been ten years and maybe more
First set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace of the Lord above

People talkin' all around
'Bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name
Baby, when I, baby, when I, baby, when I
Oh, try to make love

Mmm, work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand time
However hard I tried
Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, Heartbreaker

Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heart
