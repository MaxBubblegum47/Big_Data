[Intro]
Uh-oh, uh-oh
J. Dash
Uh-oh, uh-oh

[Chorus]
I made a little bit of money (I made a little bit of money)
I paid my bills (I paid my bills)
I paid this cover (I paid this cover)
I ain't finna stand still (I ain't finna stand still)
'Cause now I'm finna
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop
Now let me see you
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop (Yeah)
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
Wop if you love me, get lost if you don't
Look at the reaction when I hit 'em with the front
Got fleezy in the back, got chello in the front
Listen to the record boy, I got what you want
Beats so fly 'cause the club on chomp
Got hizz like woofs beatin' in the back of the door
Ladies take it back, throw back the joint
Bend at the waist, lean to the front
Now bounce yo' body to the, just a little bit harder
Shawty move yo' feet just a little bit
Ain't nobody here wop better than me
Purple flag to the left, who better than me?
I got an all-star squad, who better than me?
Man, listen to the beat, who better than me?
I paid to get in, so I ain't finna chill
And my week been way too long to stand still

[Chorus]
I made a little bit of money (I made a little bit of money)
I paid my bills (I paid my bills)
I paid this cover (I paid this cover)
I ain't finna stand still (I ain't finna stand still)
'Cause now I'm finna
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop
Now let me see you
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
J. Dash why you had to do it like that
Got the ladies checkin' they bags
Looking like they breakin' they backs
Breakin' they backs
Takin' it back, back, back, wait
Now I'm checkin' shawty with a microbraids (Braids)
Hotta' than a baby in a microwave
Look at how she woppin', man she might get paid
Wop, wop, wop a little harder
Look at how she wop, she a party starter
I hope that security remembered to card her
'Cause I ain't finna wop, but with you ain't holler
Said I never drop dime but I drop you a dollar
Told her give me your number and maybe I call her
She said that she knew me and she know I'm a baller
Man I better wop outta here, I'll see y'all tomorrow

[Chorus]
I made a little bit of money (I made a little bit of money)
I paid my bills (I paid my bills)
I paid this cover (I paid this cover)
I ain't finna stand still (I ain't finna stand still)
'Cause now I'm finna
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop
Now let me see you
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop (Yeah)
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop (Ayy)
