[Click here to read how Leon Bridges wrote “Lisa Sawyer”]
Ooh oh, Oooohoo oh, Oohoo ooh, Oohooho
She was born in New Orleans
New Orleans, Louisiana
Branded with the name Lisa Sawyer
Circa 1963
Grandmother was Indian
Indian
Her mother's name was Eartha
Swift as the wind
Fierce as fire
Her father's name was Victor
Worked two jobs to provide for his flock
She was the youngest of seven
Seven
She grew up on Louisa Street
Chaos around but inside cozy
Small but a mansion in her eyes
Eyes, eyes, mansion
Never had much money
Money
But was filthy rich
With the wealth you couldn't get from a dark casino
Or a lottery ticket
They had love
Love, love
Rich in love
She had the complexion of
The complexion of a sweet praline
Hair long as the sea
Heart warm like Louisiana sun
Voice like a symphony
Of the most beautiful instruments, Ooh
Beautiful
At the age of sixteen
Sixteen
She found Christ at an altar
All along he was calling her name
The gospel spoken from an old wrinkly man
Man, man
Gospel
She was born in New Orleans
She was born in New Orleans
She was born in New Orleans
New Orleans
