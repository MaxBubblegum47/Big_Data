[Intro]
Okay
Yeah this will work
Okay 100 episodes
Where do I start?

[Verse 1]
He was boy she was a girl
Can I make it anymore obvious
He was a punk she did ballet
What more can I say?

He wanted her
She'll never tell secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

[Chorus]
Where going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar we're going down
Swing swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love in this club

[Bridge]
Infinite content
Infinite content
We're infinitely content
'Cause we lost it all nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry I can't perfect

Infinite content
Infinite content
We're infinitely content
Now it's just to late and we can't go back
Sorry I can't perfect

[Verse 2]
Five years from now she sits at home
Feeding the baby all alone
She turns on the tv
Guess who she sees
Skater boy rocking up MTV
She calls up her friends
They already know
They all've got tickets to see his show
She tags along
Stands up in the crowd
Looks up at the man
She turned down in an earlier round

[Chorus]
And sugar we're going down
Swing swing from tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love in this club
