[Intro]
I never wanted to
Run away from you
I felt real bad
But that was what I did

[Verse 1]
I never wanted too
I didn't hear from you
And you weren't there for me
So that was what happened

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not sorry
Cause we were boring
I'm not ignoring anything   anything

[Chorus]
There's only so much I can take
Before I start to doubt it
There's only so much I can give
You should think about it
Yeah, you should think about it

[Verse 2]
It's time to have my fun
There's no way it's done
Take me with no regrets
And that is what I'll do

[Verse 3]
I'll never understand
Where were you coming from?
And where did you go?
You weren't there for me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
There's only so much I can take
Before I start to doubt it
There's only so much I can give
You should think about it

[Verse 4]
There's only so much we can do
Can we do without it?
There's only so much you can say
Did you forget about it?
Did you forget about it?

[Verse 5]
I never wanted to
Run away from you
I felt real bad
But that was what I did

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
There's only so much we can do
Can we do without it?
There's only so much you can say
Did you forget about it?
Did you forget about it?

[Outro]
I never wanted to
Runaway from you
I felt real bad
But that was what I did
