[Intro: Usher]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Ur-sher, baby
Oh-woah-oh-oh
I'm gonna love you, yeah
Baby, oh-woah-oh-oh
Soon as I touch you there

[Verse 1: Usher]
Come and ride on me like the waves
I flip the pages 'cause I wrote the book
On the way how to sex you up, sex you up
We can do it like I'm on the stage, we'll have an audience
Baby, I'll show you the way that I sex you up
Or I can lick you up and down 'til you say
You love how I eat on that pussy
You just might go put a tat' on that pussy
That says Usher, Usher
There's no other, other (Yeah!)
Damn girl, yeah, you got that juicy
Love when I make you cum, I make it gushy
One without the other
I'm the champion lover, lover
Fuck you to sleep, wake you up again (Oh)
I go so deep, beat it up again (Oh)
Girl, come and sit on my tongue again
'Cause I love to taste you, yeah
I can tell you been eating your pineapples (Mmm)
Girl, your pussy taste like pineapples (Oh)
Girl, when I hit your G, you feel like you gon' pee
Baby, cum for me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Huh, now where you been? It's been a year
Baby, I ain't seen you, you know I miss you (Oh, woah)
Baby, let me love you back to sleep once more
And I know we don't speak no more (Oh)
But I just wanna tell you I'm sorry (Hey!)

For all the Georgia peaches in Decatur
For all these bitches in the elevator
I just want you to love me (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, baby, don't test me (Huh), you know I'll do it
You want me to say your name, girl? Okay, Karrueche

Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, and rock you back

[Verse 3: ZAYN]
Baby, just stay comfortable, I want you as you are
Baby, just lay there naked waiting for me
Let's not get emotional, let's be who we are
Can we do that? Can we do that? Can we?
Know it's been a long day, it's 'bout to be a long night
So keep your eyes closed 'til I roll through
So, baby, when you're feeling like a woman in the sheets
Somebody splitting your knees, don't worry that's me
I'm over here putting work in
Baby, you ain't gotta tell me what you want

[Chorus: Chris Brown, 
ZAYN
 & 
Both
]
Just let me rock (And let me love you, baby, 
ooh
, oh girl)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh (Yeah)
Don't say a word no, girl, 
don't you talk
 (Huh)
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, girl (Yeah), and rock you back (
Fuck you back to sleep
)

[Outro: Chris Brown & 
ZAYN
]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah,

Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love (Rock you back, oh)
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, girl,

Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
Right back, rock you back
