[Verse 1]
I know you're out in Cabo
Hanging with your brother
Wishin' that I was your bottle
So I could be close to your lips again
I know you didn't call your parents and tell 'em that we ended
'Cause you know that they'd be offended
Did you not want to tell 'em it's the end?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else
So, I guess that it's gone
And I just keep lying to myself
Oh, I can't believe it, I-

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now

[Verse 2]
You weren't a fan of pictures
So I hardly ever took 'em
Got them saved in my mind from the bedroom
So that way I can't forget your skin
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else
So, I guess that it's gone
And I just keep lying to myself
Oh, I can't believe it, I-

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now

[Bridge]
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is
Yeah, I saved all the texts off of my ex
Minus the tears
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was
'Cause I-

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now
I can't help it, I just
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now
I can't help it, I just
