[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real-ass bitch
A real-ass bitch, bitch
What are the rules for breakfast today? (Grow it like a real)
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?  (Grow it like a real)
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real-ass bitch  (Grow it like a real)
A real-ass bitch, bitch (Grow it like a real)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
My niggas taking over
BROCKHAMPTON, call your momma
My niggas goin' platinum
Break necks, send you to the doctor

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Best boy band since One Direction
Makin' niggas itch like a skin infection, mm
Did me wrong like a perfect stepson, mm
Been a wrong, you can change the song, hon

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
Who got me riled up?
Who the lame-ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, who got me riled up?
Who the lame ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, come get it from me, ugh
Come get it from me, ugh
Come get it from me
Ugh, ugh, ugh, come get it from me

[Verse 5: Joba]
Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I gotcha
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Realign the spine, fuck the haters
Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I gotcha
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Realign the spine, fuck the haters

[Verse 6: Merlyn Wood]
When you see me in the street, they say, "Willy, Willy!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Now I'm sad, everybody wanna suck my willy
When you see me in the street, they say, "Willy, Willy!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Now I'm sad, everybody wanna suck my willy

[Verse 7: Dom McLennon]
They be like, "What the fuck is you on?" when we hit the room
Move til' these niggas throw me in the tomb
Hear the sounds of the fader when we spin the tunes
Everything feel right now you in the womb
Wanna motivate you in the afternoon
Top-shelf money, that's my new perfume
Twist it up, light the end and inhale the fumes
I'm the one that zoom if you just assume

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
