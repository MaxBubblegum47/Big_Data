[Intro]
(Song fading out)
So you just heard "Dance On Me" by GoldLink here on Soulection Radio. I have an exclusive featuring Masego, called Late Night
Keep it locked

[Verse 1: Masego]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I admit it, I admit it
Yeah, you're not the only woman in my phone, yeah
I be up late chattin', interactin', straight mackin'
With all these other people, I'm sorry

[Hook: Masego]
Especially up 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Especially up 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Got me askin' for 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Baby I don't know what to do, for me, for more
Late night life
Late night life
Late night life
Late night life

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
I admit it, I admit it
You're not the only woman in my phone
I'll be up late chattin', interacting
Wit' all bad bitches and these other people
Oh, I'm sorry
Drivin' in Oakland girl
Forgot the night before
Stayed at the Westin Inn
Looked in those tempting eyes
And you're all on my mind
Confident in you skin
Me, my boys and your friends
Yeah we had a good time
I hope to see you

[Hook: Masego]
Especially up 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Especially up 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Got me askin' for 'round 2, or 3, or 4
Baby I don't know what to do, for me, for more

[Outro]
When I saw him, there was just something different. Like we always have so much fun. And they're crazy, like - him and his friends, they're so funny. It makes me so happy to be with them. Even when they say that he's the bad guy. You hear shit, but you find how to tune it out. Life's too short to ask questions. When you see Goldlink...just know that's all me, baby
