[Verse 1]
Honestly

Honestly, I'm tryna stay focused
You must think I've got to be joking when I say
I don't think I can wait
I just need it now
Better swing my way

I just need some dick
I just need some love
Tired of fucking with these lame niggas baby
I just need a thug

Won't you be my plug, ayy
You could be the one, ayy
We could start with a handshake baby
I'ma need more than a hug

[Chorus]
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now

Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now oh now

[Verse 2]
Give it to me like you need it, baby
Want you to hear me screaming, heavy breathing
I don't need a reason baby
I want it till you can't fight
I can give it to you right babe oh

I wanna be your healing
I can be real good
Please don't get in your feelings
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, and you can't judge

[Chorus 2]
Girls need love too (Yeah)
Girls, girls need love too
Girls need love (Let me tell you something)
Girls need love (Girls need loving too)
Girls need love too
So what's a girl to do when she needs loving too
