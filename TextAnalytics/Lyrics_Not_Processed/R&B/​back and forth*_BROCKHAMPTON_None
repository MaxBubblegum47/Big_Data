[Lyric
s
 from Snippet]

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I keep rapping with my kin
Back and forth, don't let them niggas in
I know some things some niggas don't
You are laughing with yo' friends
I keep rapping with my kin
Back and forth, don't let them niggas in
I know some things they don't

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
I wish you'd stop
