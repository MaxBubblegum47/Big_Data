[Verse 1]
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

[Chorus 1]
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

[Piano interlude]

[Verse 2]
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

[Chorus 2]
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

[Guitar solo: George Harrison]

[Verse 3]
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone

[Chorus 3]
It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
