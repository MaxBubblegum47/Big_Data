[Intro]
Always been feeling low
It never seems to go
This shit is getting old
I wanna change, you know

[Verse 1]
I know it's coming
The change is coming
I felt so lonely
Now I'm becoming
The one I wanted
The sun is helping
To feel stronger

[Chorus]
You can't stop me
I don't wanna love it
Me
I don't wanna love it

[Verse 2]
This is the time
To do something more
I know you can
Today is the day
I know it's coming
The change is coming
I felt so lonely
Now i'm becoming
The one i wanted
The sun is helping
To feel stronger

[Chorus]
You can't stop me
I don't wannaï»¿ love it
Me
I don't wanna love it
Me
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna love it
