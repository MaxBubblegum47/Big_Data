[Verse 1]
Today was the worst day, I went through hell
I wish I could remove it from my mind
Two months away from you, but I couldn't tell
I thought that everything was gonna be just fine

[Pre-Chorus]
The postcard that you wrote with a stupid little note
Something wasn't quite right about it
It smelt like cheap perfume and it didn't smell like you
There is no way you can get around it
Because you wrote

[Chorus]
"I wish you were her"
You left out the "E"
You left without me
And now you're somewhere out there with a
Bitch, slut, psycho babe
I hate you, why are guys so lame?
Everything I gave you
I want everything back but you

[Verse 2]
My friends tried to tell me all along
That you weren't the right one for me
My friends tried to tell me to be strong
I bet you didn't think that I would see

[Pre-Chorus]
The postcard that you wrote with a stupid little note
Something wasn't quite right about it
I wanna see you cry, like I did a thousand times
Yeah, you're losing me, you're losing me now
Because you wrote

[Chorus]
"I wish you were her"
You left out the "E"
You left without me
And now you're somewhere out there with a
Bitch, slut, psycho babe
I hate you, why are guys so lame?
Everything I gave you
I want everything back but you

[Pre-Chorus]
The postcard that you wrote with a stupid little note
Something wasn't quite right about it
It smelt like cheap perfume and it didn't smell like you
There is no way you can get around it
Because you wrote

[Chorus]
"I wish you were her"
You left out the "E"
You left without me
And now you're somewhere out there with a
Bitch, slut, psycho babe
I hate you, why are guys so lame?
Everything I gave you
I want everything back but you

[Outro]
"I wish you were her"
You left out the "E"
You left without me
Everything back but you
"I wish you were her"
You left out the "E"
You left without me
Everything back but you
