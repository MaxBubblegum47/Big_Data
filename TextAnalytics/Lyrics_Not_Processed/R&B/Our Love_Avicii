[Verse 1]
I'd sail away
Just to follow you
I'd chase the dream
Across the blue
'Cause I am rich
No matter what I lose
I'd rather risk it all
And find the truth

[Chorus]
It's all because of, our love
Oh all because, of our love
All because, of our love
It's all because, of our love
It's all because, of our love
Oh all because, of our love
All because, of our love
It's all because, of our love

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna change my heart
And start anew
And turn myself
Into someone new
If I can't be the one I choose
I'd rather leave it all
And die with you
And something new
And die with you
And die with you

[Chorus]
It's all because of, our love
Oh all because, of our love
All because, of our love
It's all because, of our love
It's all because, of our love
Oh all because, of our love
All because, of our love
It's all because, of our love
