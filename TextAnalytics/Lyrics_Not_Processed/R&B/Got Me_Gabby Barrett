[Verse 1: Gabby Barrett]
Finally found the kind of man who stays
Like He promised, like He said on that day
There's never been a sweeter love I've known
When I left him, He never left me alone

[Chorus: Gabby Barrett]
Nothing can separate
Me from amazing grace
Jesus, You're all that I need
If everything falls apart
And I don't know where to start
You'll bring me back to my knees
'Cause You're good and a God who's got me
Who's got me

[Verse 2: Gabby Barrett, Shane & Shane & All]
When I was stuck inside my sin in shame
You pursued me though I spit in Your face
Nothing I could ever do to change
'Til You changed me ('Til You came)
'Til You died in my place

[Chorus: Gabby Barrett & Shane & Shane, Gabby Barrett]
Nothing can separate
Me from amazing grace
Jesus, You're all that I need (Mmm)
If everything falls apart
And I don't know where to start
You'll bring me back to my knees
'Cause You're good and a God who's got me
Who's got me

[Bridge: Gabby Barrett, Shane & Shane & All]
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
Give me Jesus (Give me Jesus, ooh)
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus (Give me Jesus)
You can have all this world
You can have all this world
You can have all this world (You can have all this world)
But give me Jesus

[Chorus: Gabby Barrett]
Nothing can separate
Me from amazing grace
Jesus, You're all that I need
If everything falls apart
And I don't know where to start
You'll bring me back to my knees
'Cause You're good and a God who's got me
