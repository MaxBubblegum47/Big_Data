[Vedo:]
Do you remember girl what we had, I was your first and still cool wit cha dad
Do you remember girl late nights watching movies on the sofa everything was kosher
Even before you went away to school
Yes I was mad at you, but you were still my boo
I remember late nights talking on the phone
You get upset, hang up
I call you back, know that get to me
Only nigga never did you wrong
I know, you got a man
But he don't know the history
I can still pull up on ya parents
Pictures still on the fireplace
Girl I miss you and its apparent
I know I got a girl, but you're still my baby
You were my, you were my baby
That's alright girl and its driving me crazy
Even though we use to argue (argue)
We got something special (oh!)
I know its been a minute, but baby we ain't finished
You will always be my boo

[Sydney Renae:]
Do you remember boy
The first day that we met
Cause I remember
Do you remember boy
The way you looked at me
Had me all smiling, feelings so differently
You know you still make me laugh
Can't nobody do that
Or even come close
To still miss the days
Where I use to come hold you
I still miss yo mama cooking
I see you on instagram know you be looking
I know you be lurking and inside I'm hurting
I'm still the same person but still out here searching
For what we had, I could never duplicate that
Just thinking back to when you were my baby

[Vedo:]
You were my baby (you were my)
And its driving me crazy
Even though we used to argue (know we use to)
We got something special (oh!)
I know its been a minute, but baby we ain't finished
You will always be my boo
Do you remember girl
Who put that nigga in his place
On my mama, I don't play about my bae

[Syndey Renae:]
Yes I remember boy
You will protect me and you will never let me get hurt

[Vedo:]
I don't want nobody lying to you
I don't want nobody crying to you or breaking down to you

[Syndey Renae:]
Well you don't have to worry because what we had is so much deeper

[Vedo:]
Girl you remember from the bed to the floor, to the shower
They was knocking bout a hour

[Sydney Renae:]
Yes I remember, but what the point of reminiscing when I can't even have what I've been missing

[Vedo:]
True, but she might have my time
But you always gonna have my heart

[Syndey Renae:]
And you gonna have my heart too
And I'ma always love you
And I will never put no one above you

[Vedo:]
You were my baby, you were my baby
And that's alright girl, and its driving me crazy
Even though we used to argue (argue)
We got something special
I know its been a minute but baby we ain't finished
You will always be my boo
