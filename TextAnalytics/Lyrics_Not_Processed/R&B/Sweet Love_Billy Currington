[Verse 1]
9:00, May 28th
The first time I saw your face
You walked up and said
I hate this place
I said, I do too
We stayed up and talked til dawn
Every night all summer long
Figuring out how to get along
Then it all fell through
And then the leaves fell too

[Chorus]
We had sweet love
Dancing in your room all night
Couldn't stop kissing you
To save my life
Baby, baby, we had sweet love
Just cause we got off track
Don't mean we can't get back
Baby, baby to that sweet love
Love, love, sweet love

[Verse 2]
I know the third time's a charm
But you and I ain't gonna go that far
Cause if I get you back in my arms
I ain't letting go again
Cause all of my sleepless nights
They're just a waste of time
Without you I'm living a lie
And it's a lonely sin
So let's dive back in

[Chorus]
To that sweet love
Dancing in your room all night
Couldn't stop kissing you
To save my life
Baby, baby, to that sweet love
Just cause we got off track
Don't mean we can't get back
Baby, baby to that sweet love
Love, love, sweet love
To that sweet love
Love, love, sweet love

[Bridge]
So come on, come on
Give me one more try girl
A love like ours
Shouldn't never die, girl
So come on, come on
Bring it back to life, girl
Cause I ain't gonna lose it
Another time
Oh, sweet love
Oh, sweet
Oh, sweet
Oh, sweet love

[Chorus]
Sweet love
Dancing in your room all night
Couldn't stop kissing you
To save my life
Woah, baby, baby
Sweet love
Dancing in your room all night
Couldn't stop kissing you
To save my life
Baby, baby, to that sweet love
Just cause we got off track
Don't mean we can't get back
Baby, baby to that sweet love
Love, love, sweet love
To that sweet love
Love, love, love
Oh, sweet love
