[Intro]
I better slow down
'Cause I keep keep trippin' on words I don't wanna say
Just tell me right now
'Cause I keep keep seein' the signs you want me to stay

[Verse 1]
I can't commit, I can't make plans
Sometimes the bet ain't worth the hand
I think you're special, it makes me sad
Don't wanna wonder what we could've had
And I hope you understand

[Chorus]
Don't get your feelings broken for nothin'
Maybe I'm leavin'
Leavin' here with nothin'
I might regret that I can't be your man
Sometimes the bet isn't worth the hand
And I can't keep lettin' this wave carry me away
So tell me right now
'Cause I keep keep seein' the signs you want me to stay

[Verse 2]
I got it bad
I think you know
You're everything, you're beautiful
But my life is fast, can't make it slow
We're here right now
Kiss me before I go, but you got to let me go

[Chorus]
Don't get your feelings broken for nothin'
Maybe I'm leavin'
Leavin' here with nothin'
I might regret that I can't be your man
Sometimes the bet isn't worth the hand
(I been hurt before, don't wanna hurt no more)
Sometimes the bet isn't worth the hand
I gotta let ya know girl
I can't let it go any longer
Sometimes it ain't worth the hand
