[Verse 1: Bea Miller]
Is she the one?
The one you've been waiting for?
Is she the one?
Is she the one?
The one you've been dreaming of?
Is she the one?

[Pre-Chorus: Bea Miller]
I'm tired of staying up all night with you on my mind
Still I'm laying here
Yeah, I'm laying in the shirt you used to like
No, I shouldn't mind
All I think about is

[Chorus: Bea Miller]
Does she move your body?
Like I moved your body?
'Cause I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know
Does she make you feel wanted?
Is she all you wanted?
'Cause I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know

[Post-Chorus: Bea Miller]
I want to know
I want to know
Is she all you wanted?
'Cause I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know

[Verse 2: Bea Miller]
Is she the one
That I couldn't be for ya?
Is she the one?
Mm, I hate that you're the one
That I never get over
That I wanna get closer to

[Pre-Chorus: Bea Miller]
I'm tired of staying up all night with you on my mind
Still I'm laying here
Yeah, I'm laying in the shirt you used to like
No, I shouldn't mind
All I think about is

[Chorus: Bea Miller]
Does she move your body?
Like I moved your body?
'Cause I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know
Does she make you feel wanted?
Is she all you wanted?
'Cause I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know

[Post-Chorus: Bea Miller]
I want to know
I want to know
Is she all you wanted?
'Cause I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know
I want to know

[Chorus: Bea Miller]
Does she move your body?
Like I moved your body?
'Cause I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know
Does she make you feel wanted?
Is she all you wanted?
'Cause I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know

[Post-Chorus: Bea Miller]
I want to know
I want to know
Is she all you wanted?
'Cause I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know

[Outro: Bea Miller]
I want to know
Is she all you wanted?
'Cause I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know
I want to know (I want)
Is she all you wanted? (I want)
'Cause I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know
I want to know
