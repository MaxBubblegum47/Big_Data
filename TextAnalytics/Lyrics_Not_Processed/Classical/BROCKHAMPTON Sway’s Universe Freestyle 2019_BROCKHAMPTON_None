Came up in this bitch, Sway, and I ain't use protection

[Verse 3: Joba,

Suckin' on kinky binkies
They put the pole in their derrières, we drink milk straight from the titties (
Titties
)
She call me daddy, play truth or dare (
Truth or dare

Lysergic acid on gummy bears
Sour or sweet like the Chinese chicken
If the booty bouncin', I stop and stare

Let's go, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
Said, "Change your clothes," like Pharrell to Jay
Prolly wearin' how I feel today
Bootleg Versace, platters on the platter
We servin' these niggas like B2K
Roll paper planes of that MIA
Bari got visa, he here to stay
Niggas is talkin', they do not play
I game for keeps like I'm Dolla, Dame
Niggas know I do not play when I run in this beat
Niggas know I be runnin' in these streets
Like I'm a vagabond
Everything I do I fuckin' get ratted on

[Verse 5: Merlyn Wood]
Do what I want
This what I do what I want
I see it, I like it
Now it's in my pocket
Off the top, off the topic
I'm off the top, and I'm off the topic
Doin' shit off the topic
She wanna sloppy top me
I'm not that naughty

[Outro: Kevin Abstract & 
Joba
]
You a freak hoe
Ooh

Okay, BROCKHAMPTON on Sway
Nah, nah, okay

Not watchin' any day
You just go and say okay
I got the camera up front
Now you all about to be on YouTube
Now you see me on YouTube

I don't know what to do, do
I'm just rappin' on Sway
Ian, go and take it away
You got it?

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Mic check, mic check

BROCKHAMPTON, never threatened
Never feel pressure from the threat
I could've been Nas, I'm more like Lil Nas X

Merlyn Wood

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (
Bounce baby, bounce baby

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Watching' my life change in front of my eyelids
Saint without a God, I represent for the hybrids
Was ridin' out through the city, when somethin' hit me
Just to go on and say fuck anybody not comin' with me
'Cause there's only one of me
Without y'all, there be fifty niggas
Really must be silly, I can break it down so simply
To a point where you would figure and nearly forget what I'm sayin'
What can I say man, I guess I am a rap genius
King flow, only seven queens on my penis
Iceman, you can see frost on every anklet
Rollin' up the greenest, Odd Future, you couldn't dream us
Saw my life upon the floor, went to go pick up the pieces
I really broke it down
Like I was a Mobb Deep with the choir sound
Quiet storm, when I go with the violent form
Everybody know I'm spittin' in my final form

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Final form, yeah, you see me, bruh
I used to have blond hair like Vegeta
I used to be smokin' that reefer
But I ain't smoke today, Sway
How Sway, how Sway?
Sway, are you okay?
Somebody tell me
I'm hot, somebody jail me

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Bitch, I told my dogs that I gotta ball
I'm from Texas, so it's all y'all
Catch me, bitch, that's a trust fall
