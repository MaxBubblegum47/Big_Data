[Verse 1]
All you gotta do is say yes
Relieve your mind, no pain, baby, don't stress
'Cause we can take the long way home
Tipping on 44's so the neighbors can't see my chrome
Where you at? What you on?
I'll pick you up, promise won't take too long
What you need? You know I got it
We smoking on this gas and you know it's exotic
You give me weird feelings, and bae I can't hide it
We walk up in the club and they bumping on my shit
Two middle fingers up, got me blushing and smiling
It's only 2 AM but this moment is timeless
And we the flyest

[Chorus]
Crusin' in my 64
I be riding through your city, yeah
Crusin' in my 64
Riding through your city, yeah
Jockin' bitches and hoes
Crusin' in my 64
Riding through your city
Crusin' in my 64, 64
Riding through your city, yeah
Crusin' in my 64
Riding, riding, riding
Crusin' in my 64
Riding, riding, riding
Jockin' bitches and hoes
Crusin' in my 64
I be riding through your city, yeah
Crusin' in my 64, 64
Riding through your city, yeah

[Verse 2]
We can take our time now
Baby, let's just vibe out
Fuck them girls, you're mine now
It's my time, let me shine now
Rolling on 16's
Gripping wood grain and thinking 'bout big dreams
The silver still stained and wonder if you feel me
'Cause Kaash still playin, should be in the big leagues
Tryna hit the top speed
64, tryna hit the top speed
Let the windows down, I'm tryna cop a nice breeze
You my boo thing, my lil' yeah, my main squeeze
You'll never find nobody ever like me

[Chorus]
Crusin' in my 64
I be riding through your city, yeah
Crusin' in my 64
Riding through your city, yeah
Jockin' bitches and hoes
Crusin' in my 64
Riding through your city
Crusin' in my 64, 64
Riding through your city, yeah
Crusin' in my 64
Riding, riding, riding
Crusin' in my 64
Riding, riding, riding
Jockin' bitches and hoes
Crusin' in my 64
I be riding through your city, yeah
Crusin' in my 64, 64
Riding through your city, yeah
