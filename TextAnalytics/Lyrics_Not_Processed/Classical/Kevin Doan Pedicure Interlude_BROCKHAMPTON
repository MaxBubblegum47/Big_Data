[Interlude: Kevin Doan]
"And then I had like, um, my mom and dad had, like, nail shops and I would, like, go to my mom's and she would have the pedicure chairs. I would sit in them sometimes and just fill them up and put my feet in the water like this and I would make sure it's really high and then like, sometimes, like McDonald's had, like, their happy meals and their toys. And I remember they had surfs up and I got, like, the penguins and stuff and they had, like, the surfboards and l would like, put them in the water and we'd play with them. The toys in the water. And like, I can't imagine, like, I guess adults, like going in to get their nails done would just, like see this kid playing with toys in the water. And this is Kevin Doan, you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."
