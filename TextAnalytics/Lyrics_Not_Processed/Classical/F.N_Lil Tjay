[Intro]
(Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If  you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga)
If  you tell, you a fuck nigga
(How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What’s  up with you? I grew up with you
Used  to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you)
(Fuck  niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga)
Fuck nigga
Nah, Lil Tjay (Fuck nigga), yeah, yeah
(Now  I'm wishing that a bus hit you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt, yeah)

[Refrain]
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust

[Verse 1]
Cartier glasses, 20/20, got a clear view
You a man, I don't fear you
Act up, we gon' mask up, boy, I dare you
Brody catch a body, I'ma leave you in the rearview
Could have did it to me, lil' nigga, you were scared to
You a bluff and you not who you appear to
You'd be starstruck if you see a nigga near you
And your bitch wanna fuck, I don't care to
Careful, if I say links, plan's canceled
I can have your shorty in my bed doing dance moves
Fuck that, let's get right back to the real shit
In the field shit, niggas really used to drill shit
Mama stressed out, whole lot she gotta deal with
Swear every real nigga gon' feel this
Smokin' on drugs 'cause there's too much to deal with
SB strapped up in the field with it

[Chorus]
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga
How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What's up with you? I grew up with you
Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga
How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What's up with you? I grew up with you
Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you

[Verse 2]
My mama know about the pain, thought I'd never change
But looking back, for the fame, I felt the same
I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain
I ain't have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain
And shit, all I ever wanted was to have a name
Had a lot of shit to lose, not enough to gain
And that fuck nigga changed, went against the grain
Found out my homie went fed, almost went insane
Strictly business, you ain't with it, you get parked, nigga
I don't know you, you wasn't with me from the start, nigga
I remember catching stains in the park, nigga
Me and Bubba tryna catch an opp after dark, nigga
My mama told me, "Wisen up, be a smart nigga"
So all my niggas on go like a kart, nigga
Smelly drive mean a bullet to your heart, nigga
I don't really wanna speak facts, see the chart, nigga

[Refrain]
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust

[Chorus]
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga
How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What's up with you? I grew up with you
Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga
How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What's up with you? I grew up with you
Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, and now I'm wishing that a bus hit you

[Outro]
Lil Tjay
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
