[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
A loser, a rental
A dentist, I been to
And take a lose from me and I'll be out it, out it
Tryna make y' smile, wanna make out
But I'm too childish, childish
Fucked a loser, in his rental
A dentist, I been to

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
You got freckles on your lip, lip, lip
They might give you cancer, shit, shit, shit
Wring your wrist and take a swish, swish, swish
Big hole, flushin' out the script, script, script
Backwoods, blowin' off a zip, zip, zip
So we still spit the belt, ain't no heaven on a hell
Brush your hair so I see yourâ€”

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I don't wanna be sober
So I can lie to my lovers
Got sad and said I loved her
I was high, I ain't mean it
I ain't lyin', I got problems
I'll leave for no reason
Make love with no feelings
I be your nigga for the evening

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
In between the bridges filled with kerosene
Are words we never said, turned into a routine
My feelings still remain unseen
Can't intervene with anything that's on the screen
When life is playin', they play games and expect me to pick a team
I can't win, I can't breathe, everything ain't what it seems
I played my case and then erase my underlying self-esteem
I know it's awful for my health, I know it all becomes extreme
I can't redeem from this regime that's invaded all of my dreams
From the asphalt to the steam, we found a theme then made a scene
At the moment that the guillotine was the only vaccine don't intervene
Shit ain't been the same since I was 17
Fuckin' up is in my genes, I think I need a quarantine, yeah

[Outro: Joba]
Chain-smoking, got twenty things on my mind (Yeah)
Fake feelings, when I hit it from behind (Yeah)
Consenting to my heart's demise (Oh)
I fall in love and fall in line (Oh)
Tip toe-in' in tap shoes when you're sleepin' in the corner (Shh)
Leave before I fall in love with you, I'm a self-proclaimed loner (Shh)
A novice with a master plan (Yes I am)
Genuine but fraudulent (Yes I am)
