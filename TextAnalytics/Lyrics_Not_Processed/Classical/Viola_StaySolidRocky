Woah (
Chris Beats

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

[Chorus]
Viola, I used to know ya
Creep with my toaster, tonight I must hold ya
Pray for my soldiers that's ridin’ in stolens
Metal stay low, they will strike when provokin'

[Verse]
I feel I'm chosen
They know that I got it
They look in my eyes and they see what I’m rockin' (Bling, bling)
I'm all in the fire, I stay on my .9 so you know that I'm plottin'
I ain't beatin' 'em up
I’m gettin’ 'em gone, I can’t smoke out the profit
Life it be new to all us
We all hella young, but we totin' our rockets
I feel I'm fallin' and you’re lettin' me fall
I call the jail, I tell 'em free all my dawgs
If you fuckin' with Lil Nine, you know we gettin' involved
It broke my heart that time I'm missin' a call
Wash my hands with these niggas, but my spray dirty
Fuck her, call an Uber, make her leave and catch her flight early
Niggas say we beefin', ain't no beef, boy, you don't like jerky
I ain't even mad, I'll drop a bag for any slight purpose
I'm prayin' to the Lord he come and save me, I don't like service
The truth gon' bring you pain
I saw the truth and now my eyes hurtin'
Walkin' in the rain with no disguise, but I got slight service
Walkin' in the rain, I hide this .9, I'm only slight nervous
I might pop another from the gutter, I predicted this
I tried to let them jump up on this train, but they done missed this shit
With my dog, like Scooby Doo, we turn you to a mystery
Look at Rocky now, he got them books, ain't talkin' history

[Chorus]
Viola, I used to know ya
Creep with my toaster, tonight I must hold ya
Pray for my soldiers that's ridin' in stolens
Metal stay low, they will strike when provokin'
Viola, I used to know ya
Creep with my toaster, tonight I must hold ya
Pray for my soldiers that's ridin' in stolens
Metal stay low, they will strike when provokin'
