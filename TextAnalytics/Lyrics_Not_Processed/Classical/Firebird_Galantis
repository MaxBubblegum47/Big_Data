We started at the cinema
T-roof dancing, hands in the wind
Rizlas, rolling up a cigarette
The boys are calling shotgun again!

Hot-blooded like a harlequin
Our heroine is trembling
Shake-shaking like a tambourine
Colors running into our skin!

Under the stars awaken to the sound of a firebird
Under the sky, half-naked, oooh oh oh oh
Under the stars awaken to the sound of a firebird
Under the sky, half-naked, oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh

Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh

And all the stars are awaken
To the sound of the firebird
Under the sky half naked
Oh oh, oh oh oh

We started at the cinema
T-Roof dancing hands in the wind
Rizlas, rollin up a cigarette
The boys are calling shotgun again
Hot blooded like a harlequin
Our heroine is tremblin
Shake shaking like a tambourine
Colors runnin into our skin

Oh oh, oh oh oh Oh oh, oh oh oh

Under the stars awaken
To the sound of a firebird
Under the sky, half-naked, oooh oh oh oh
