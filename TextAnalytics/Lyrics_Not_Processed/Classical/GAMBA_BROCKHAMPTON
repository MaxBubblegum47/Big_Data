[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I don't know why I wanna fuck with you
But all I know is that I really fuck with you
Really wish you didn't like to fuck with me
Wish you took that energy and trusted me
I get so exhausted when you fuss with me
'Cause all that time could be spent in love with me
I know I need it and you deserve it
You like to size me up to see if it's all worth it
I don't know where it is now, but I'm searchin'
I think you want what I don't ever want: be perfect
'Cause I ain't perfect, I just wanna be good to you
I would take my heart right out the hood for you
Wanna do the things I know I should for you
Standing by myself until I stood for you
If I knew this love, I woulda looked for you
But I'm glad you found me, I'm glad you found me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip
What you gonna do when you older?
What you gonna do when you grow?

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Split the diamond with us, fuck taking the bus
I want a whip to call my own and a home to call my own
All 14-15 of my niggas
To figure, ooh, that's a step-back
Ooh, my nigga, that's a step-back
If I had to choose, I would not choose you
If I had to stop, I would turn around and choose glue
If I had to hit the brakes, I'ma stop right here
If I had to choose, I'ma not choose you
If I had to turn around, I'ma turn into some glue
If I had to hit the brakes, I'ma stop right here, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip
What you gonna do when you older?
What you gonna do when you grow?

[Breakdown: bearface]
You're all I love, washing off my hands
You're all I love, washing off my hands
You're all I love, washing off my hands

[Bridge: bearface]
Don't waste your mind
I'll be the one to say it all
To do what I am
To say what I am
Don't waste your mind
I'll be the one to settle
To do what I am
To say what I am

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & bearface]
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall (you're all I love)
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip (washing off my hands)
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall (you're all I love)
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip (washing off my hands)
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip, fall (you're all I love)
Callin', callin', callin', callin', trip (washing off my hands)
What you gonna do when you older?
What you gonna do when you grow?

[Outro: Joba]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
