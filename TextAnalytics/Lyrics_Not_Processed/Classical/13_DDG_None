[Intro]
Tre on the beat, yuh

[Chorus]
I was 13 when I lost my virginity
Fast forward, 8 years, bitches still feeling me
Dropped 6 racks on a penthouse and amenities
Watch how I'm finna be, loose off this Hennessy
I was 13 when I lost my virginity
Fast forward, 8 years, bitches still feeling me
Dropped 6 racks on a penthouse and amenities
Watch how I’m finna be, loose off this Hennessy

[Verse 1]
Trust all of you niggas, all you niggas is my enemies
Niggas only hate when they main bitch be feeling me
Like are you in a relationship like bitch are you kidding me?
Like she don't already know I still fuck with Kennedy
Running from these demons and these ghosts like I'm Pacman
Broke niggas be robbing, I’m more like Batman
You ain't buy shit, why the fuck are you capping?
I copped a beamer before i started rapping

[Chorus]
I was 13 when I lost my virginity
Fast forward, 8 years, bitches still feeling me
Dropped 6 racks on a penthouse and amenities
Watch how I'm finna be, loose off this Hennessy
I was 13 when I lost my virginity
Fast forward, 8 years, bitches still feeling me
Dropped 6 racks on a penthouse and amenities
Watch how I'm finna be, loose off this Hennessy

[Verse 2]
In the biggest section with a bad bitch
One on my left and my right like a sandwich
Bitch I'm a baller, I shoot in her basket
I'ma Chris Paul her, she not cute I pass it
Millions I have, G Wagon gas it
Getting the bag from the Earth 'til my casket
I'm a dog nigga, I should bark and quit talking
Her Uber too much so i told her she walking

[Chorus]
I was 13 when I lost my virginity
Fast forward, 8 years, bitches still feeling me
Dropped 6 racks on a penthouse and amenities
Watch how I’m finna be, loose off this Hennessy
I was 13 when I lost my virginity
Fast forward, 8 years, bitches still feeling me
Dropped 6 racks on a penthouse and amenities
Watch how I’m finna be, loose off this Hennessy
