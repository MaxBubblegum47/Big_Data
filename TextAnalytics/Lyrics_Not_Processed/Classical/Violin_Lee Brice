[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I'm down on my knees again
A call for my repentance
The war has taken over me
I beg for the forgiveness
The bullets ricochet, uh
I hear 'em when I sleep now
The blood is on my hands Lord
From man, woman, and child (A soldier from my country)
I'm a soldier from my country (A slave unto my gun)
But a slave unto my gun (The screams to echo louder)
The screams to echo louder (Kill, kill)
God, what have I become? (Whoooa)
I pledge my allegiance
I left my family, a new born baby
To slay the enemy, the struggle for power
The lust, the vanity
I trusted America, she took my sanity

[Hook: Lee Brice]
Winds of change rollin' in
Take your love back again
I'm your fool, Amen
Just a bow for your violin
You played me
You made me your violin

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
She looks at her reflection
Eyes black and blue
She told them she would leave him
She said she was through
He took her from a small town
Showed her the big city life
He promised her the world
Then he made her his wife (He runs around town)
But he runs around town (Lies, lies)
He's a cheater and a beater (She's sleepin' with the enemy)
She's sleepin' with the enemy (No one believes her)
But no one believes her (Whoa)
A diamond ring, a glass of whiskey
The bottle of pain pills open and empty
She left a letter “To hell I send thee”
He brought home flowers, ashamed and guilty
Too late

[Hook: Lee Brice]
Winds of change rollin' in
Take your love back again
I'm your fool, Amen
Just a bow for your violin
You played me
You made me your violin

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Uh, used like a rag
I've been washed up, I've dragged
Through the mud like a thief
My beliefs and my loves
Take it up, take it down
Took a left, took a right
It's the one to be found
To explain to me why
Why it was me that was brought to the edge of the cliff
'Cause see this is not fair but why should you care?
The choices I've made are mine
But I swear that all cannot be the fault of just me
I've tried to maintain my wants and my needs
To work and not see the changes I've strived for
A better life for my family I would die for
Take away everything from me
And ask why more?
Tell me to make a decision in front of five doors
As I'm praying, I'm saying “Why Lord?”
Send me to a war without a sword
I'll fight and fight more
I'll travel a long road
'Cause I'm just a violin
My life is another cord
You played me
Uh, 'Cause I'm just a violin
My life is another cord
You made me
Your violin

[Outro: Lee Brice]
You played me (Violin)
You made me your violin
