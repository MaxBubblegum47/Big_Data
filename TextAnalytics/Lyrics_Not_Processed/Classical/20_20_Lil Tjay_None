[Verse 1]
I feel like the greatest
Only been at this for two years, thank God this shit happened so quick
Fashion me the latest, money comin' in but so do hatred
Shit ain't how I pictured, but I faced it
Emotions, I erased it, fuck havin' feelings, I replaced it
Should've peeped that fu' shit from the basis
This when the mistakes hit, tired of gettin' caught up in this fake shit
I just can't sit comfy with no snake shit

[Refrain]
I been holdin' demons inside, I can't lie
So if you ain't ready to die, then don't try
I gotta make it home so my mama don't cry
I'd rather do the sentence, least time'll go by
Feel the pain, so numb, I don't feel nothin'
Shooters still runnin' 'round with no chill button
Still be totin' in the town, finna drill somethin'
Let a nigga run up on me thinkin' I won't kill somethin'

[Verse 2]
And I keep the gang with me, try it, bet we air shit
Everybody get it, if it's static, we don't spare shit
Really on my bully, 2020, we ain't playin'
Now it's lit for everything, don't care 'bout what you sayin'
Mama, she was prayin', I was on that block late
Really put in twenty years of work, but then I got weight
Sunday I ain't never go to church because that block pay
Big .40 cal' in my shirt, no karate
Fuck what the opps say, fuck what the cops say
Big Smelly drive, E for E, that's the block way
If you feel a way, grrt-baow what the Glock say
All my niggas tryna get the bag, fuck the pop way

[Chorus]
I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years
They like, "Tjay, bro, you made it," I still feel like I ain't there
A lot of niggas hated, I said, "Fuck it, I don't care," 'cause I'm takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, huh
I'ma soon be the greatest

[Verse 3]
Words that they did not say, dick suckin' crazy
Everybody tryna beach for clout like it's wavy
Guess I'm just too real, I stood solid, how they made me
I can never be a goofy nigga if they paid me
Songs too heat now, everything is wavy
Lot of niggas think it's competition, they amaze me
I was goin' downhill, jail kinda saved me
Gotta keep the hard work, ain't no gettin' lazy
Smokin' opposition kinda sorta got me dazy
Think you'd last a day up in my shoes, then nigga, trade me
Bitch, I need a billion in blues like I'm JAY-Z
Huh, R.I.P. to Mavy
Bitch, I'm cookin' now, got the sauce like it's gravy
If you want a feature, get your money right and pay me
Still, when the time come, it might be a maybe
It depend on the type of record that you gon' play me
I can't do a wack verse, industry would trade me
Every time you hear my name, you know I'm goin' crazy
Really, I'm a trench kid, SB really made me
Really had the same goal and dream since a baby, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years
They like, "Tjay, bro, you made it," I still feel like I ain't there
A lot of niggas hated, I said, "Fuck it, I don't care," 'cause I'm takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, huh
I'ma soon be the greatest

[Refrain]
I been holdin' demons inside, I can't lie
So if you ain't ready to die, then don't try
I gotta make it home so my mama don't cry
I'd rather do the sentence, least time'll go by
Feel the pain, so numb, I don't feel nothin'
Shooters still runnin' 'round with no chill button
Still be totin' in the town, finna drill somethin'
Let a nigga run up on me thinkin' I won't kill somethin'

[Outro]
I'ma soon be the greatest
I'ma soon be the greatest
