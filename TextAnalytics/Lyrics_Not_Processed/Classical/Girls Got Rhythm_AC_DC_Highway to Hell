[Verse 1]
I've been around the world
I've seen a million girls
Ain't one of them got
What, my lady, she's got
She's stealin' the spotlight
Knocks me off my feet
She's enough to start a landslide
Just a-walking down the street

[Pre-Chorus]
Wearing dresses so tight
And looking dynamite
About to blow me out
No doubt about it, can't live without it

[Chorus]
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

[Verse 2]
She's like a lethal brand
Too much for any man
She give me first degree
She really satisfied me
Love me till I'm legless
Aching and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the Third World War

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'm losing sleep
But I'm in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it, can't live without it

[Chorus]
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

[Pre-Chorus]
You know she move like sin
And when she let me in
It's like liquid love
No doubt about it, can't live without it

[Chorus]
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm
You know she really got the rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
Rock 'n' roll rhythm (Rock 'n' roll rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm
