[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I want to hold your hand

[Chorus]
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

[Bridge]
And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I feel that something
I want to hold your hand

[Chorus]
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
