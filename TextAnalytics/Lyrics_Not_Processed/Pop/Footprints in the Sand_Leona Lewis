[Verse 1]
You walked with me, footprints in the sand
And helped me understand where I'm going
You walked with me when I was all alone
With so much unknown along the way
Then I heard you say...

[Chorus]
I promise you, I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sorrow and despair
I'll carry you when you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand

[Verse 2]
I see my life flash across the sky
So many times have I been so afraid
And just when I, I thought I'd lost my way
You gave me strength to carry on
That's when I heard you say...

[Chorus]
I promise you, I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sorrow and despair
And I'll carry you when you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand

[Bridge]
When I'm weary
Well, I know you'll be there
And I can feel you when you say...

[Chorus]
I promise you
I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sadness and despair (and despair)
I'll carry you when you need a friend (need a friend)
You'll find my footprints in the sand
(I promise you, I'm always there)
When your heart is full of sadness and despair (and despair)
I'll carry you when you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand
