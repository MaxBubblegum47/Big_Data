Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You say that I am insecure
But you really don't know me at all
And you say a lot of things
But I don't understand
Why you don't get me as I am
And I thought you were so cool
But now I can see right through
You act like you own me
But you don't know me
And now I'm finally through
Nothing you can do to make it right
I'm not gonna stay home tonight
'Cause I'm not tryin' to be that girl
And cry about it, cry about it
Should've know right from the start
But I'm not gonna fall apart
Boy you're gonna have to try a lot harder
If you wanna break my heart
(End of chorus)
So tell me what's this all about?
Your friends told me they saw you out
You were with another girl
And I don't know her name
Are you tryin' to hurt me intentionally?
And you know that it was wrong
{It was wrong}
How you just led me on
{Led me on}
I'm tired of pretendin
That's it's my endin
And now I'm finally through
{Here with you}
Nothing you can do to make it right
I'm not gonna stay home tonight
'Cause I'm not tryin' to be that girl
And cry about it, cry about it
Should've know right from the start
But I'm not gonna fall apart
Boy you're gonna have to try a lot harder
If you wanna break my heart
(End of chorus)
And there's nothing you can do
That'll make it right
And there's nothing you can say
Boy I can see through your lies
I'm not the girl
I used to be
There is no happy ending
To the story
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Nothing you can do to make it right
I'm not gonna stay home tonight
'Cause I'm not tryin' to be that girl
And cry about it, cry about it
Should've know right from the start
But I'm not gonna fall apart
Boy you're gonna have to try a lot harder
If you wanna break my heart
(End of chorus)
