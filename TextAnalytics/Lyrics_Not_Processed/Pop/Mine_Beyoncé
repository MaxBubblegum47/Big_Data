[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

[Chorus 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of is
We should get married
, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus 2: Drake & Beyoncé]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

[Chorus 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

[Verse 3: Drake]
From eight until late, I think ‘bout you
You own my nights, I don’t know what to do, do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus 2: Drake & Beyoncé]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

[Chorus 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup...

[Verse 4: Drake]
(Pull up on you) I gotta pull up on you
You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don’t go ghost on me, I'ma go Thriller on you, I'ma just (Pull up on you)
I'ma let my hands do the talking when I see you baby girl
I miss feeling on you,(Pull up on you) I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you (Pull up on you)
I been about you and I’m still about you but
We ain't finished talking (Pull up on you)
I told you you don’t need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking (Pull up on you)
'Cause they don’t wanna see you happier than them
And girl you swear they all ya friends and that's been a problem (Pull up on you)
You the one they hate, just come with that
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
(Pull up on you) And you tell me that you’re done with that
And I believe it's true
As long as you know who you belong to

[Outro: Beyoncé]
All I’m really asking for is you
Long as you know who you belong to
