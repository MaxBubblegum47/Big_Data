[Verse 1: Big Sean]
That into it, spitta so intricate
If they ain't feeling him they get the boot like Timberland
They still hating, I reboot 'em like computers
And let them know that your boy on the ball no hooping
But from downtown like a three-point shooter
To uptown they feel a nigga deeper than masseuses
The truth is I does this, spitting like I was toothless
Coming to you clearer than blueprints, I move in
They sleeping on me man and I ain't sheets
Bloodsuckers so I'm calling 'em leech
I gotta eat and I'm hungry like I skipped breakfast, where's the ketchup?
I'm tryna cop the Benz or Lexus for winter time
So I ain't gotta go head up to Enterprise
Just to get my ass up in a ride
But nigga's can’t see me like they born with tinted eyes?
To me you little so to see you I got squinted eyes
And I'm just tryna show all of y’all I'm a soulful dude
Compared to me you got about as much sole as shoes
And soul is food, to prove this ask your chick
She all on my dick cause I push it like a pool stick
Who is this you’re asking?
He’s cold as Alaskans, I'm on point like assassins
Y’all as common as Jasmines and Ashleys
And if you ask me you’re never gonna pass me, sheesh, I’m good

[Hook: Big Sean]
Yeah, you really wanna talk about good I'm good
You r-really wanna talk about good I'm good
Just a nigga out the hood
With dreams of being, dreams of being, dreams of being rich

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
At a instant, fresh out the trenches
Putting competitive nigga's back on they benches
I make that money my apprentice
Cause it lift me up like benching
Your baby girl wanna trap me like a prison but I can see through her like prisms
After I'm hitting I'm dipping, banana split 'n gone
And I'mma throw it to you harder than a quarterback
Working with a dime I'm just tryna get a quarter back
Whipping up that crack music, you should order that
Every 16 is a quarter that you need to hit
Well that's cool, I'm the number one pusher
If a nigga want heat I'm the number one cooker
If a nigga want beef I'm the number one butcher
I-I-I wrap around that green like a Swisher
My intention of ends getting is hella high
And y'all ain't getting your groove back like Stella di'
