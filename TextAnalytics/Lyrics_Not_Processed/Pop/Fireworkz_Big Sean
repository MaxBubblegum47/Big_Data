Fireworkz (Feat. T.i.)
I said, bitch i do it, a million dollars stacking
Packing in my weed, (?) matching
What is you asking, shut the fuck up
I'm talking in the real nigga accent
Man, and all these hoes attracted
To the fucking main attraction at my shows, my shows
Watch me do, watch me do
A hundred bottles, a hundred bottles
None for you, none for you
I'm rolling weed up, getting high
And since I came up she want me to come inside
I'm the fucking guy, man
I'm just too much, yeah, too much
I touch my fingers, my crew up
I'm from Grenada, get chewed up
Fuck around and I blew up
Me and my niggas hit the charts
Fucked around and I flew up
Yeah, nigga got two nuts and I still don't give a two fucks
Bitch, I'd do it
Uh, uh
She thought that I'd be her keeper
I don't think I ever saw a girl so fly!
Since I said nice to meet ya, I don't wanna leave her
Uh, I think I wanna make you mine!
Uh, baby you're a diva
I don't wanna see her in the whip with another guy
Come on to the table
I got what you came for
Pick up a glass, girl and let's get right!
Cause you got a hell of a body
Let me take you to jail lil mami
You got what I need
And you got what you came for
I can get you what these other niggas ain't able!
Oh, baby girl we're doing it
It's so good!
Make 'em other niggas wanna do it like this!
Oh, baby girl we're doing it
It's so good!
I keep on buying bottles if you keep on doing that!
Go ahead and do it, do it, do it!
Tell 'em bring the fireworks to my table!
Go ahead and do it, do it, do it, do it
Keep on moving, as long as you can do it!
