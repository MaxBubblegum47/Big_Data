[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

[Bridge 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

[Bridge 2: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Outro: John Lennon]
In my life, I love you more
