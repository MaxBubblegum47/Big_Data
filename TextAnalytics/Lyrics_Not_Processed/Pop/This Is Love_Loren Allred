[Verse]
From all the highest heights to the deepest lows
I keep on trying to find someone to call my own
But then the stars align, they put us together
And it feels alright, it couldn't be better
And I won't ever let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I know this is love
I felt it from the start
Yeah baby, this is love
I felt it from the start, this is love
This is love, this is love

[Instrumental]
This is love

[Verse 2]
When the stars align, they put us together
And it feels so right, it couldn't be better
And I won't never let you go, I know
But this is love

[Pre-Chorus]
I felt it from the start
Yeah baby, this is love
I felt it from the start, this is love
This is love
This is love

[Instrumental]
This is love
This is love
