[Verse 1]
I would run a marathon
To make it all up to you
And I was wrong
Yeah, I was dumb
I can tell my body's numb

[Pre-Chorus]
But for the best
It’s time I surrendered the past
There’s no defeat
A blasting heart does not bleed

[Chorus]
I fought so hard
I tried to catch up to your heart
And left for dust
Forgive me for running from us
And now I feel
Trying to capture all I need
A marathon
When I’m with you I’ve already won

[Verse 2]
I give my, my finish line
I am gonna make you mine
So ready for, to ruin my life
Pray you won’t let me die

[Pre-Chorus]
But for the best
It’s time I surrender the past
There’s no defeat
A blasting heart does not bleed

[Chorus]
I fought so hard
I tried to catch up to your heart
And left for dust
Forgive me for running from us
And now I feel
Trying to capture all I need
A marathon
When I’m with you I’ve already won
