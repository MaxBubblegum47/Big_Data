[Intro]
Yo, ADP on beats boy

[Chorus: SAINt JHN]
Anything  can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta  risk it all, tryna live a legendary life
Gotta keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions
Anything  can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta  risk it all, tryna live a legendary life
Gotta keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin'  not to mix the money up with emotions

[Verse 1: SAINt JHN]
Bentley just touched the second gear
Followed up, I say a prayer
Never know, can't be too prepared
Champagne,  booze to catch my tears
Hope this year gon' be my year
Momma told me that I was rare
Chrome Hearts shades, to hide the glare
Both eyes closed, don't fuckin' care, nigga, yeah-i-yeah-i-yeah
Dreams of a Porsche kept me up at night
Facts nigga, I'm not tryna act polite, though
True story, they don't see the sacrifice
They might take a nigga back tonight

[Chorus: SAINt JHN]
Anything can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta risk it all, tryna live a legendary life
Gotta keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions
Anything can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta risk it all, tryna live a legendary life
Gotta keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah
Load up the jet, I'm ready (Load it)
I'm tryna live this shit legendary (Livin' it)
I got these niggas upset already
All these diamonds that's on me, they're necessary
I got King in my blood, it's hereditary (Yeah)
She show me love like it's February (She did)
I fell asleep, I was in that pussy
When I woke up she givin' me head already, yeah (Woo)
She wanna' spoil me (Spoil me), I just want loyalty (Loyalty)
Yeah (Yeah)
Choppa' in a Lamborghini, that shit feel like royalty (Royalty)
Yeah, (Yeah)
Niggas know it when they see me, it ain't no extortin' me (Woah)
Catch me in traffic, it's action, no lackin', I'm movin' accordingly
I’m watchin' Kanye on the television, talkin' Trump
He’s supportin' him (Damn)
I have some niggas with tunnel vision and a plug
They deported them (Damn)
I know some niggas that's jealous of me for my hood
They wanna' slaughter me (Brr)
I know they never can get to me
I done got rich, man these niggas is history

[Chorus: SAINt JHN]
Anything can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta risk it all, tryna live a legendary life
Gotta keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions
Anything can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta' risk it all tryna live a legendary life
Gotta' keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions
