[Verse 1]
I got a fast car, gassed up, sittin' in the driveway
Got a road that I know like the back of my hand
We could head out right now, baby, we could fly away
And disappear outta here fast as we can

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I miss you, baby
Ooh, I'm going crazy

[Chorus]
There's a diamond sky that's waitin' for us just outside of town
With the moon hangin' for me and you, baby
We can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around
Kill the space in between, slide across that leather seat
Heart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do
Is get closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you

[Verse 2]
Wanna taste that great wide open freedom
Wanna make the distance razor thin
Wanna feel you feel me feel you breathing
'Til we can't tell where you end and where I begin

[Chorus]
There's a diamond sky that's waiting for us just outside of town
With the moon hangin' for me and you, baby
We can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around
Kill the space in between, slide across that leather seat
Heart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do
Is get closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I miss you, baby
Ooh, I'm going crazy

[Chorus]
There's a diamond sky that's waiting for us just outside of town
With the moon hangin' for me and you, baby
We can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around
Kill the space in between, slide across that leather seat
Heart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do
Is get closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you
Closer, closer, closer to you
Closer to you
