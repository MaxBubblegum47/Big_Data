[Intro]
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

[Chorus]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh pretty baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

[Chorus]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[Interlude]
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go

[Bridge]
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[Chorus]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[Bridge]
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe?
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
