[Intro]
Oh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

[Verse]
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

[Bridge]
Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one

[Chorus]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

Outro
]
Will never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Break down
Tear me up inside
When you break me down
