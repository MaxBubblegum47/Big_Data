[Verse 1]
I was low, didn't believe in getting higher
Didn't know, how easy it is to walk through the fire

[Hook]
Oh-oh-oh-oh! You
Opened the stars in my heart
You let in the light from the dark
It's like the first time I realized that all you need is love

[Chorus]
And I'm feeling, never letting go
Oh, you take me, somewhere off the globe
Do you feel it? It's like the first time
I realized that all you need is love
Yeah, I'm feeling, never letting go
Oh you take me, somewhere off the globe
Do you feel it? It's like the first time
I realized that all you need is love

[Verse 2]
I was saved, cause nothing's too free for my heart's content
All the way, yeah, up to the edge and I'm fine jumping

[Hook Variation]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Cause you
Opened the stars in my heart
You let in the light from the dark
It's like the first time I realized that all you need is love

[Chorus]
And I'm feeling, never letting go
Oh, you take me, somewhere off the globe
Do you feel it? It's like the first time
I realized that all you need is love
