[Music Visual Intro Annotation]

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Stripped down to my skin and my bones
I love huskies but I feel like a wolf (Howl!)
In a pack but I feel all alone
I'm scatterbrained man, better offer the Clon'
In Tejas apartments with racists doin' weird shit
Like, this'll make the biopic (Haha!)
Rile 'em up, hit Zaxby's, get the wing and tings (Yum!)
Real quick bills still stacking to the ceiling (Uh-oh...)
What you mean, it ain't working? (What?)
What you mean, you ain't finding yourself? (Oh, I am, I'm trying)
What you mean, you ain't got no cash? (I got a little bit...)
What you mean? What you mean?
Shouldn't your pockets be big just like a fat chick? (Uh-huh!)
Shouldn't your mama be done paying the house off? (I guess?)
Shouldn't you have a real big-ass ego? (No?)
Shouldn't these girls be flockin' just like seagulls? (Eh...)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
The original lick-splickety, higher than Yosemite
Breaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting
Making 'em say "ugh!", they worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
Often they say I’m off it, I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on, I’ll remind 'em with hostility
Hot-diggity damn, everyone running scams
Gotta cover your clams and take another glance
Running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans
It's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect
Lap you in a UFO, I haven't started yet
Still gotta figure out exactly where to park it at
Moses with the pen, each line an ocean I can part it at
But that's too deep

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Don't call me stupid
That ain't the way my name pronounced
Don't call me Cupid
I got too many hoes right now
Poolside in Houston
Tryna see if Beyoncé will take me for adoption
Broke-ass rich suburbs
A civilian shot in 3rd Ward, we just by the fountain
This is Merlyn Wood, man
Everywhere I go is The Woodlands
I need a honey-butter
Bodka in a Sprite can
When I'm in the Whataburger
All the kids know who I am
I need a honey-butter
Pouring lean in my Sprite can

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I got a record but I'm clean as they come
I'm Godzilla, when they see me, they run
On 37th, used to run from the Bloods
The undercovers gotta duck when they come
I moved out and in a couple of months
I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug
I used to write raps on the back of the bus
Now I'm in the front seat shifting the gears

[Verse 5: Joba]
It's funny how things can change
Three hundred dollars to my name led to Hollywood
I was living off ramen and change
Five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
Growing up my teachers told me
"You better get them grades up if you wanna finish high school
And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street"
Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan
Listening to *NSYNC, saw my name on the CD
Bleach blond tips, wanted to be JT
Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
One might say I was doomed from the get-go
But those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
