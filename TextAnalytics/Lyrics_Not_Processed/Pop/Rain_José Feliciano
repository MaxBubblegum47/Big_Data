Listen to the pouring rain
Listen to it pour
And with every drop of rain
You know I love you more
Let it rain all night long
Let my love for you go strong
As long as we're together
Who cares about the weather?
Listen to the falling rain
Listen to it fall
And with every drop of rain
I can hear you call
Call my name right out loud
I can here above the clouds
And I'm here among the puddles
You and I together huddle
Listen to the falling rain
Listen to it fall
It's raining
It's pouring
The old man is snoring
Went to bad
And bumped his head
He couldn't get up in the morning
Listen to the falling rain
Listen to the rain
