[Refrain]
Don't know if I'm gonna stay and listen
'Cause I've stayed and listened and nothing else has changed

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know if I'm gonna try and reason
But I'll try to be decent, I owe that anyway

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, take your time when you say (Say)
Take your time when you
Change your mind back
'Cause you've changed your mind, hm-hm

[Refrain]
Don't know if I'm gonna stay and listen (Stay and listen)
'Cause I've stayed and listened and nothing else has changed

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know if I'm gonna try and reason
But I'll try to be decent, I owe that anyway (Way)

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, take your time when you say (You say)
Take your time when you
Change your mind back
'Cause you've change your mind
