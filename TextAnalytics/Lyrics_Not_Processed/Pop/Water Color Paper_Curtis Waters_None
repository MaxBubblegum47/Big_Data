[Intro]
You should know by now that I'm indecisive
We could go on a trip way up in the climate
I know you got to go home so stay a while
I wanna paint you like some water color paper
Yeah
Yeah
(Good job Curtis!)

[Verse 1: Felix Wood]
Water color paint imma color you green
You say you don't love me baby what do you mean?
I look like a rock star in a white tee
Put my hands on your neck and my hip inbetween your knees
What
I-I don't know if I mean it
I say stuff at night and hopin' that you gon' read it
And smile when you see it and call me when you fiendin' and cry up on my shoulder when you're all up in yo' feelings
I'm not simping but I need you to be sympathetic
I have a lot of off days and a lot that I'm regrettin'
But I'm often kinda (?) and I promise you I meant it
And when I said that you my favorite and I need you to feel special yeah
Damn my clothes baggy I be walking with a limp
Shopping at the thrift I got the lobster but the shrimp
Don't judge me by the rock that I lift
I stir that little homie (??)

[Chorus: Felix Wood]
You should know by now that I'm indecisive
We could go on a trip way up in the climate
I know you got to go home so stay a while
I wanna paint you like some water color paper
I'm really hopin' that I'm gonna see you later

[Verse 2: Curtis Waters]
See you later for dinner im hopin
Yeah you made my heart be open
Cry on my chest whenever you breakdown
I try my best I try to not let down
I say something when tryna be honest
I broke your phone repeatedly callin'
Send you a text where I said I'm sorry
Send you a text where I said sorry
I saw that look on your face
You smile then blew me away
I said hi to both your friends
Only to get in your way
I didn't know what to say
But I could not look away
Please give me the time of day
Please give me the time of day

[Chorus: Felix Wood]
You should know by now that I'm indecisive
We could go on a trip way up in the climate
I know you got to go home so stay a while
I wanna paint you like some water color paper
I'm really hopin' that I'm gonna see you later
You should know by now that I'm indecisive
We could go on a trip way up in the climate
I know you got to go home so stay a while
I wanna paint you like some water color paper
I'm really hopin' that I'm gonna see you later

[Outro]
