[Intro]
Ooh, Ooh

[Verse 1]
My tongue is sealed within my mouth
These certain words, they can't come out
These thoughts are walking on their own
Dancing around with no control

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what I did to you was wrong
Hence why I've kept it for this long
Secrets have been brewing up a storm
Did not expect it to transform

[Chorus]
Soaked up in my brain
For another day
These things I'm tryna say
Get drenched and swept away, that's the truth
Soaked up in my brain
Don't know what to say
Something about you, boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do (Ooh, ooh)
Something about you, boy
You soak up half my brain

[Post-Chorus]
You look at me like I hit you (Ooh, ooh)
Stole all your things then left you bruised (Ooh, ooh)
Look what I've got myself into (Ooh, ooh)
My words are stuck, my body too (Ooh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what I did to you was wrong (know what I did to you was wrong)
Hence why I've kept it for this long (So long, so long)
Secrets have been brewing up a storm (A storm)
Did not expect it to transform

[Chorus]
Soaked up in my brain
For another day
These things I'm tryna say
Get drenched and swept away, that's the truth
Soaked up in my brain
Don't know what to say
Something about you, boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do (Ooh, ooh)
Something about you, boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do (Ooh, ooh)
Something about you, boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do

[Post-Chorus]
I know what I did to you was wrong (Know what I did to you was wrong)
Hence why I've kept it for this long (So long, so long)
Secrets have been brewing up a storm (A storm)
Did not expect it to transform (Transform)

[Chorus]
Soaked up in my brain
For another day
These things I'm tryna say
Get drenched and swept away, that's the truth
Soaked up in my brain
Don't know what to say
Something about you, boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do (Ooh, ooh)
Something about you, boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do (Ooh, ooh)
Something about you, boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do

[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh)
