[Verse 1]
Babe, I don't wanna talk right now
Stop, I need a little space
Ooh, ooh
Wait, didn't mean to say it like that
Stay a little longer please
I sleep a little deeper when you're next to me

[Chorus]
Don't you know you're the fire in my bones?
You're my heart and my home
Ooh, and I know I don't say it enough
I've been down on my luck, my luck
But I'll be fine in the mornin' next to you

[Verse 2]
Ooh, think I'm losin' my mind again
Go slow, touch me like you do
Love, come a little closer now
I breath a little deeper when I'm next to you

[Chorus]
And don't you know you're the fire in my bones?
You're my heart and my home
Ooh, and I know I don't say it enough
I've been down on my luck, my luck
But I'll be fine in the mornin' next to you

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Next to you)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Next to you)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Next to you)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
I'll be fine in the mornin'
