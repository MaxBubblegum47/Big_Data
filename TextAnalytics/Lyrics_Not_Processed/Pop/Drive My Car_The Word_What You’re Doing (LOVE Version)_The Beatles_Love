[Verse 1: Drive My Car]
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah!

[Taxman Solo]
Aaaahhhh!

[Verse 2: What You're Doing]
Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

[Verse 3]
You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

[Bridge: The Word]
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Outro: Drive My Car]
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
