[Verse 1]
Bite your face to spite your nose
Seventeen and a half years old
Worrying about my brother finding out
Where's the fun in doing what you're told?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "No!"
"Oh, give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned eighteen year old
Give me a night, I'll make you"
"I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But, girl, I'm not your saviour"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now

[Chorus]
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

[Verse 2]
A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh, she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you"
"You just sit and get stoned with thirty-year-olds and you think you've made it"
"Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now

[Chorus]
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls

[Bridge]
I told her from the start
Destined to be hard
I told her from the start
I'll break your heart
Destined to be hard
Break your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But, girl, I'm not your saviour"
"Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now

[Chorus]
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls
'Cause they're just girls
