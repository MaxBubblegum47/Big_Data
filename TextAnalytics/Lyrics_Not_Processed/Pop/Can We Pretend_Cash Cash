[Verse 1]
I remember conversations
We were dancing up on tables
Taking pictures when we had nowhere to post
You were laughin', I was cryin'
We were dancin', we were dyin'
Sometimes I don't know how we walked away

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If I'm honest what I liked
Were the things we didn't know
Every morning, every night
I'd be beating down your door
Just to tell you what I'm thinking
But you already know
Screw this, I don't wanna let it go

[Chorus]
So can we pretend that I'm 22 today?
Dancin' on the tables with you, oh yeah
Can we pretend that we all end up okay?
I just wanna forget with you, oh yeah
Can we pretend that we both like the president?
Can we pretend that I really like your shoes? Hell yeah
Can we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me
Let's pretend, oh, let's make believe
Can we, can we pretend?

[Post-Chorus]
Can we pretend?

[Verse 2]
I remember what we wanted
What we'd never take for granted
How our daddy issues took us to LA

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I'm honest, what I miss
Is not knowin' what to say
And the feeling of your lips
And it haunts me every day
When you'd tell me what you're thinking
But I'd already know
Screw this, I don't wanna let it go
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
So can we pretend that I'm 22 today?
Dancin' on the tables with you, oh yeah
Can we pretend that we all end up okay?
I just wanna forget with you, oh yeah
Can we pretend that we both like the way it is? Hell yeah
Can we pretend that we like these fake-ass dudes? Oh yeah
Can we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me
Let's pretend, oh, let's make believe
Can we, can we pretend?

[Post-Chorus]
Can we pretend?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If I'm honest, what I liked
Were the things we didn't know
Every morning, every night
I'd be beating down your door
Just to tell you what I'm thinking
But you'd already know
Screw this, I don't wanna let it go

[Chorus]
Can we pretend that we both like the president?
Can we pretend that you like my fake-ass shoes? Oh yeah
Can we pretend? Cause honestly reality, it bores me
Let's pretend, oh, let's make believe
Can we, can we pretend?

[Post-Chorus]
Can we pretend?
Oh, can we pretend?
Can we? Let's make believe
Can we (Can we)

[Outro]
Can we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me
Let's pretend, oh, let's make believe
Can we, can we pretend?
Honestly
