[Verse 1]
You will say you're dreaming up a way
You're dreaming up a way to explode
There's a time you'll seek out a disguise
When you think people hate you the most
And it gets worse before it gets better
That's one thing that I have come to know
Just so you know

[Chorus]
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

[Verse 2]
All the things you don't wanna let go
You wanna look back on and recall
All the times that feel like everything
When nothing really happens at all
They're still here
Oh, in that important room
We've got your pictures up on the wall
Up on the wall

[Chorus]
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

[Bridge]
Break a promise to your ex
(Nothing happens)
You are terrified of sex
(Nothing happens)
The first time is humiliating
(Nothing happens)
Something you'll want to forget
(Nothing happens)
Your parents will eventually separate
(Nothing happens)
Dad's stuff in trash bags and in the pool
(Nothing happens)
Oh guess what? You have a sister now
(Nothing happens)
And as you go on and shit gets hard, don't worry about me

[Outro]
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
(You're ready and you know it)
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
(Something you'll always remember)
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
(Your parents will end up where they belong)
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
(They'll eventually talk again, though)
Do not wait, do not wait, do not wait
(And guess what? She's obsessed with you)
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
(When shit gets hard, don't worry about me)
Oh
Oh
Oh
