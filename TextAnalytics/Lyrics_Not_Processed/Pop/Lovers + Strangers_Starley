[Verse 1]
Wrote another text that I'll never send
Oh, I wanna say so many things
Like you've been on my mind
I hope you're doing fine
Oh, I wanna say but I don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Used to know you better than I know myself, than I know myself
You look familiar but it's clear
You're someone else (Now you're someone else)
Now you're someone else (Now you're someone else)

[Chorus]
Lovers become strangers quick as they became lovers
Fast as lightning strikes, it's feeling like thunder
I know that it's the end and yet I still wonder why we
Why we gotta be strangers
Why we gotta be strangers
Why we gotta be strangers

[Verse 2]
Try not to think about 'cause it's getting late
And I, I hate the fact that it's all a waste
You didn't break my heart
We just fell apart
Try not to think about you and I, I, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Used to know you better than I know myself, than I know myself
You look familiar but it's clear
You're someone else (Now you're someone else)
Now you're someone else (Now you're someone else)

[Chorus]
Lovers become strangers quick as they became lovers
Fast as lightning strikes, it's feeling like thunder
I know that it's the end and yet I still wonder why we
Why we gotta be strangers
Why we gotta be strangers
Why we gotta be strangers

[Chorus]
Lovers become strangers quick as they became lovers
Fast as lightning strikes, it's feeling like thunder
I know that it's the end and yet I still wonder why we
Why we gotta be strangers

[Chorus]
Lovers become strangers quick as they became lovers
Fast as lightning strikes, it's feeling like thunder
I know that it's the end and yet I still wonder why we
Why we gotta be strangers
