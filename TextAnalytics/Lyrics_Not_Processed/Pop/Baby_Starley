[Intro: Luis Fonsi]
Sé que te gusto a ti todavía
Tres, dos, uno

[Verse 1: MARINA]
Standing here in an empty room
I saw you there, and my blood ran cold
Take me back to that long September
Don't know how I ever let you go
I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go

[Pre-Chorus: MARINA]
Find me in another place and time
If only, if only you were mine
But I'm already someone else's baby

[Chorus: MARINA & Luis Fonsi]
Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's (C'mon)
Baby, ah
Baby, ah
Baby, ah
I'm already someone else's

[Verse 2: MARINA]
All caught up in the way we were
I feel your hands getting close to mine
Don't say the words that I love to hear
The beat goes on and I close my eyes
I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Let's leave things the way they were
You'll stay with me like a lullaby

[Verse 3: Luis Fonsi]
Hey
Sé que te gusto a ti todavía por mucho que digas
Además puedo ver en tus ojos que no sólo quieres quedar como amigos
Tienes mi corazón, eres mi obsesión
Soy tuyo pa' siempre

[Chorus: MARINA, Luis Fonsi & Both]
Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Tell myself be stronger
My heart's like a rubber band
And it's such a shame
You'll always be the one who got away
We both know that deep down you feel the same
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's (C'mon)
Baby, ah
Eso no es amor
Baby, ah
Mereces mejor, yeah
Baby, ah
Quiero tu calor
I'm already someone else's

[Bridge: MARINA]
Wish I met you at another place and time
If only, if only you were mine
This love story ends for you and I
'Cause I'm already someone else's

[Chorus: MARINA & Luis Fonsi]
Baby, ah
Y lo digo otra vez
Baby, ah
Mereces mucho mejor, mucho mejor
Baby, ah
Lo que tienes con él (Con él) no es amor, no
I'm already someone else's
Baby, ah
Cada noche más te extraño, cada día sin ti me hace daño
Baby, ah
Sabes que mereces mejor, lo que sientes por él ya no es amor
Baby, ah
Por mucho que digas somos más que amigos
I'm already someone else's
Y el tiempo se acaba en cuatro, tres, dos, uno
