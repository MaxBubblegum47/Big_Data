I'll go my way by myself
This is the end of romance
I'll go my way by myself
Love is only a dance
I'll try to apply myself
And teach my heart how to sing
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing
I'll face the unkown
I'll build a world of my own
No one knows better than I myself
I'm by myself alone
I'll go my way by myself
Here's how the comedy ends
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends
Gray clouds in the sky above
Have put a blotch on my fun
I'll try to fly high above
For my place in the sun
I'll face the unkown
I'll build a world of my own
No one knows better than I myself
No one knows better than I myself
How I wanted love and fell
Now I say what the hell
All of those black days are gone
Cause its solo, all alone
By myself, from now on
