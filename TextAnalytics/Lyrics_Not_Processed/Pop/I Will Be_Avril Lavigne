[Verse 1]
There’s nothin' I could say to you
Nothin' I could ever do
To make you see what you mean to me
All the pain, the tears I cried
Still you never said goodbye
And now I know how far you’d go

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I let you down
But it's not like that now
This time I’ll never let you go

[Chorus]
I will be all that you want
And get myself together
'Cause you keep me from fallin' apart
All my life, I’ll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything okay

[Verse 2]
I thought that I had everything
I didn’t know what life could bring
But now I see, honestly
You're the one thing I got right
The only one I let inside
Now I can breathe, 'cause you're here with me

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I let you down
I’ll turn it all around
'Cause I would never let you go

[Chorus]
I will be all that you want
And get myself together
'Cause you keep me from fallin' apart
All my life, I’ll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything okay

[Bridge]
'Cause without you, I can’t sleep
I’m not gonna ever, ever let you leave
You’re all I got, you’re all I want, yeah
And without you, I don’t know what I’d do
I could never ever live a day without you here with me
Do you see you're all I need?

[Chorus]
And I will be all that you want
And get myself together
'Cause you keep me from fallin' apart
All my life (My life), I’ll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything okay

[Chorus]
I will be (I'll be) all that you want
And get myself together
'Cause you keep me from fallin' apart
And all my life, you know I’ll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything okay
