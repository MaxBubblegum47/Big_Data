[Verse 1]
Gotta get myself out of this town
Cause we got a lotta history
And if I don't get away, I might drown
In a sea of haunting memories
Everybody wants to know what happened
Cause they thought that we were meant to be
And I'm sorry I don't have an answer
But people always asking me

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah people always asking
People always asking
People always asking me

[Chorus]
I tell them
If you don't want me to keep feeling this pain
Don't say his name
Don't say his name
Cause he's not something that I wanna explain
Don't say his name
Don't say his name
It's too soon
It's too soon
It's too soon
Don't say his name
Don't say his name

[Post-Chorus]
Don't say his name
Don't say his name
Don't say his name
Don't say his name

[Verse 2]
And I wonder where you're sleeping
Cause I know it isn't next to me
Gotta find that silver lining
And think of it as being free

[Pre-Chorus]
And people always asking
People always asking
People always asking me

[Chorus]
I tell them
If you don't want me to keep feeling this pain
Don't say his name
Don't say his name
Cause he's not something that I wanna explain
Don't say his name
Don't say his name

[Post-Chorus]
Don't say his name
Don't say his name

[Bridge]
Got me worked up, all upset
I just can't talk about it yet
Cause you know I'm not okay
I just don't know what's left to say
Got me worked up, all upset
I just can't talk about it yet
Cause you know I'm not okay
I just don't know what's left to say

[Chorus]
I tell them
If you don't want me to keep feeling this way
Don't say his name
Don't say his name
Cause I don't think that I should have to explain
Don't say his name
Don't say his name

[Post-Chorus]
Don't say his name
Don't say his name
It's too soon
It's too soon
It's too soon
Don't say his name
Don't say his name
