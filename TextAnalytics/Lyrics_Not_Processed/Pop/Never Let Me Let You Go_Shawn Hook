[Verse 1]
Why can't you just let this heartbreak kick in?
Rule number one: We can't still be friends
No late night phone calls
No 'How have you been''s
I've seen that movie, I know how it ends

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You start up the fight
Excuses to see me tonight
You say, "I'm moving on"
Then why you back here in my arms?

[Chorus]
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home

[Verse 2]
Morning I wake up with you in my bed
This instant coffee tastes just like regret
Counting the days 'til I start to forget
As soon as your scratches clear up off my neck

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You apologize for doing this time after time
You say, "I'm moving on"
Then why can't you ever stay gone?

[Chorus]
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home

[Refrain]
Why do ex lovers make the best lovers?
And always get the best of us?
Messing up my head and my covers, ohh, ohh, oh
Why do ex lovers make the best lovers?
And always get the best of us?
Messing up my head and my covers, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
'Cause every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home, home, home, yeah

[Chorus/Outro]
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home (you show up at my home)
You never let me let you go
(You never let me let you go)
You never let me let you go
(You never let me let you go)
(You never let me let you go)
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home (my home)
You never let me
You never let me let you go
