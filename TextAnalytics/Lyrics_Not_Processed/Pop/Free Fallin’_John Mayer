[Verse 1]
She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy about Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
Yeah, yeah
It's a long day living in Reseda
There's a freeway running through the yard
I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart

[Chorus]
And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

[Verse 2]
All the vampires walking through the valley
They move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

[Chorus]
And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

[Post-Chorus]
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin'

[Verse 3]
I want to glide down over Mulholland
I want to write her, her name in the sky
I want to free fall out into nothing
Oh, I'm gonna leave this, this world for a while

[Chorus]
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

[Outro]
Free fallin', fallin'
Free fallin', fallin'
Free fallin', fallin'
Yeah, yeah
