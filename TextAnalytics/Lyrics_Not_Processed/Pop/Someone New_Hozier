[Verse 1]
Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

[Chorus]
And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

[Verse 2]
There's an art to life's distraction
To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else; I guess any thrill will do

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

[Chorus]
And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

[Bridge]
I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha
That you would pray for him
'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every dayâ€¦

[Refrain]
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better

[Chorus]
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
