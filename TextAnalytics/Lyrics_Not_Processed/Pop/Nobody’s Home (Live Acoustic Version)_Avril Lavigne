[Verse 1]
Well, I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way
She felt it every day
And I couldn't help her
I just watched her make
The same mistakes again

[Pre-Chorus]
What's wrong, what's wrong now?
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

[Chorus]
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

[Verse 2]
Open your eyes
And look outside
Find the reasons why
You've been rejected
And now you can't find
What you've left behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Be strong, be strong now
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

[Chorus]
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

[Bridge]
Her feelings she hides
Her dreams she can't find
She's losin' her mind
She's fallin' behind
And she can't find her place
She's losin' her faith
She's fallen from grace
She's all over the place
Yeah, oh

[Chorus]
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

[Outro]
She's lost inside, lost inside
Oh-oh, yeah
She's lost inside, lost inside
Oh-oh
Yeah
