[Intro]

[Verse 1]
If there was ever such a clever
Breed of roses that were redder
Than the A upon the bosom of the chick in scarlet letter
I would toss them to the dirt and would appreciate ‘em better
And would toss another bud upon hearing the word whatever
It’s your favorite
I know it cuz you said it enough
We was in it to “Uh”
But came out it in love
It’s a gift from above
It’s the curse of the dove
Fall in love and you can fall right into something that’s rough, but take
I got a knack for bein’ too into the world around me
That’s probably why you never trust me when there’s girls around me
You know I never lift a finger like paralysis
I swear that incident happened cuz I was out of it, I swear
I swear you say that once is, is always
And now that time where we existed lives far away
Been tryna work it out but patience is worn
If you ever see some roses better check em’ for thorns and say…

[Hook]
They said we were a match made in heaven
I guess you never saw it that way
Oh the flowers I gave you and the love songs I made you
I will never give you roses again

[Verse 2]
Remember that time where we were sittin’ by the lake hmm
And we were talkin’ bout all the mistakes I make hmm
How all that shit them broads were talkin’ bout was fake hmm
And every apology that I gave you wouldn’t take hmm
Is it my fault that you ain't used to datin’ rappers?
And is my only gift to you a little laughter?
What about that glass slipper happy ever after
When you walked all of me and was surprised the glass shattered
Shoulda known that I was sharper than that, huh princess?
And fuck ya teapots, yeah the twin sets
Fuck ya wind chime when the fuckin wind hits
And fuck that pillow that you ordered that ain't in yet
Could give a damn about ya new school buggie
Errybody know the old school’s better, hunny bunny
So let this be my last bouquet
I be hoppin’ in the game I got a field to play and say…

[Hook]
They said we were a match made in heaven
I guess you never saw it that way
Oh the flowers I gave you and the love songs I made you
I will never give you roses again
