[Verse 1]
I've always dreamt of travel
Why should we die where we were born? (Born)
Some roads are laid with gravel
Sometimes you gotta build your own (Own)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna tear down boundaries
I wanna greet my enemies
I wanna see what I haven't seen
'Cause I know there's more

[Chorus]
I take the world by storm (Storm, storm, storm)
I take the world by storm (Storm, storm, storm)

[Verse 2]
I don't have any answers
The more I know, the more I grow (Grow)
I don't know where I'm going
But I'ma search 'cause I see hope (Hope)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna tear down boundaries
I wanna greet my enemies
I wanna see what I haven't seen
'Cause I know there's more

[Chorus]
I take the world by storm (Storm, storm, storm)
I take the world by storm (Storm, storm, storm)

[Bridge]
There's got to be more than this
Gotta figure out how to jump the wall
I wanna live and learn
Don't matter if I land or if I fall
I know I might return
At least I know I'll be walking tall
I'm not afraid

[Chorus]
'Cause I take the world by storm (Storm, storm, storm)
I take the world by storm (Storm, storm, storm)
