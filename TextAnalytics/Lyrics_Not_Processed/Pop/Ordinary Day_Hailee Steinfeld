[Chorus: Logic]
It was an ordinary day
Until I saw you crawl around my way
And the night goes
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
It was an ordinary day
Until I saw you crawl around my way
And the night goes
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on (All right)
On, and on, and on, and on 
(All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right)

[Verse 1: Logic]
Cocaine in the back, hard liquor to the right
Don't really drink, but shit, I might
This the type of shit I like, everyone just livin' life
Livin' life like this is dangerous
Anybody ain't just this famous
Everybody from the young to the old
Anybody with a little bit of money get shameless
You know you fuckin' boujee, you know you fuckin' dumb
You know you get the shit smacked outta you back where I'm from
Hold up, wait up
This shit is made up
Feel like I'm dreamin', I'ma wake up
Girl, I can see through yo' makeup
I can tell by the look in yo' eyes
I can tell by the fact you don't know how to act
I see right through yo' lies
I'm a real mothafucker, whatcha know 'bout that?
Like yeah, wassup?
Everybody out here actin' tough
I might get drunk, call yo' bluff
This right here, yeah, that's yo' nuff
Yeah, you know me, I know you
But bitch, I been here before you
I'ma show you, I'ma show you, I'ma show you

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
And so they tell me that they love me
But I know that's it's all for show, it's all for show
And I tell her that she lovely
But she know that's it's all for show, it's all for show

[Chorus: Logic & 
Hailee Steinfeld

It was an ordinary day
Until I saw you crawl around my way
And the night goes
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on

[Verse 2: Hailee Steinfeld]
Oh all right, all right
I know everyone's fakin' it tonight
But I know that I love the way I feel right now
So I don't wanna let them bring me down
It's an ordinary day, I'm gonna live it how I like

[Chorus: Logic & 
Hailee Steinfeld

It was an ordinary day
Until I saw you crawl around my way
And the night goes
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
