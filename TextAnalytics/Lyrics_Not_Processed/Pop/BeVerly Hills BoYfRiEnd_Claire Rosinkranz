(get in the car honey)
Verse 1
She's a wacky crazy lady
He's a rich rich man
She moved to the state of California
With two kids in hand oh
Pre chorus
She's a super star making money
And she found a boy to call honey
Sunny dummy funny boy
Used him as her little toy
Chorus
She's got her Beverly Hills boyfriend
Spending all of his money
It's ok he's got a lot
Spent a portion on my mom
Beverly Hills boyfriend
He's gone for the weekend
Doesn't care about his bills
Guess that's what life's like in the Hills
(da da da da da da)
Verse 2
She's got funky little quirks
He is always gone at work now
She's living in royalty
Is she living in loyalty
Now champagne is popping on Sundays
He's away and sipping on Bombay
Wasting bucks on beauty queens
Far away and can't be seen
Chorus
She's got her Beverly Hills boyfriend
Spending all of his money
It's ok he's got a lot
Spent a portion on my mom
Beverly Hills boyfriend
He's gone for the weekend
Doesn't care about his bills
Guess that's what life's like in the Hills
(da da da da da da)
