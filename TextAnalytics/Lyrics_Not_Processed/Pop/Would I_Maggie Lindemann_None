[Verse 1]
I thought if I was older
I'd have less on my shoulders
I can't tell if I'm sad or bored
Most nights I am not sober
L.A.'s making me colder
I've got voices I can't ignore

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything is never enough
If I wasn't afraid of love, yeah
I would've loved ya
If I wasn't so insecure
If I wasn't easy to hurt then I wouldn't hurt ya

[Chorus]
If all of my friends wanted to jump
Would I, would I?
If I could feel nothing, if I could feel numb
Would I, would I?
If I could forget you without all the drugs
Could I, could I?
If all of my friends wanted to jump
Would I, would I, would I, would I?
Would I?

[Verse 2]
Empty numbers on pay checks
Good days only on weekends
It's so easy to miss the point
A-plus, call me a genius
Took my patience for weakness
I wish I would've had the choice

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything is never enough
If I wasn't afraid of love, yeah
I would've loved ya
If I wasn't so insecure
If I wasn't easy to hurt then I wouldn't hurt ya

[Chorus]
If all of my friends wanted to jump
Would I, would I?
If I could feel nothing, if I could feel numb
Would I, would I?
If I could forget you without all the drugs
Could I, could I?
If all of my friends wanted to jump
Would I, would I, would I, would I?
Would I, would I?
Would I?

[Outro]
Everything is never enough
Everything is never enough
Everything is never enough
Oh, everything is never enough, never enough
