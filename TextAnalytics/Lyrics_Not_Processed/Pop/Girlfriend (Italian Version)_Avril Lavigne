[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, non amo tua ragazza
No way, no way, trova una nuova
Hey, hey, you you, sarò la tua ragazza
Hey, hey, you, you, so che ti piaccio
No way, no way, non è un segreto
Hey, hey, you, you, sarò la tua ragazza

[Verse 1]
You're so fine, I want you mine, you're so delicious
I think about you all the time, you're so addictive
Don't you know what I can do to make you feel alright?
(Alright, alright, alright, alright)
Don't pretend, I think you know I'm damn precious
And hell yeah, I'm the motherfucking princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I'm right
(I'm right, I'm right, I'm right, I'm right)

[Pre-Chorus]
She's like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, non amo tua ragazza
No way, no way, trova una nuova
Hey, hey, you you, sarò la tua ragazza
Hey, hey, you, you, so che ti piaccio
No way, no way, non è un segreto
Hey, hey, you, you, sarò la tua ragazza

[Verse 2]
I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away, I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again
(Again, again, again)
So come over here and tell me what I wanna hear
(So come over here)
Better yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again
(And again, and again, and again)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she's like so whatever
And you could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that’s what everyone’s talking about

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, non amo tua ragazza
No way, no way, trova una nuova
Hey, hey, you you, sarò la tua ragazza
Hey, hey, you, you, so che ti piaccio
No way, no way, non è un segreto
Hey, hey, you, you, sarò la tua ragazza

[Bridge]
In a second, you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?
In a second, you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, non amo tua ragazza
No way, no way, trova una nuova
Hey, hey, you you, sarò la tua ragazza
Hey, hey, you, you, so che ti piaccio
No way, no way, non è un segreto
Hey, hey, you, you, sarò la tua ragazza
Hey, hey, you, you, non amo tua ragazza
No way, no way, trova una nuova
Hey, hey, you you, sarò la tua ragazza
Hey, hey, you, you, so che ti piaccio
No way, no way, non è un segreto
Hey, hey, you, you, sarò la tua ragazza
