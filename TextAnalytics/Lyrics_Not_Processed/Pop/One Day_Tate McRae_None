[Verse 1]
She stares at her ceiling once again with a hundred thoughts
"Maybe he knows who I am; probably not"
She walks down the hall with her head down low, scared to meet his eyes
Even when she hears his voice she's swarmed with butterflies

[Chorus]
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside

[Verse 2]
He always walks the crowded halls and is blinded by this light
A girl who keeps her head down low and never shows her eyes
He's tried to talk to her but there's no easy way
'Cause every time he raises his voice she runs away

[Chorus]
Oh, it's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside

[Bridge]
One day maybe she'll stay
And start to head over his way
And one day she'll look into his eyes
And instead of breaking, she'll call him mine
One day he'll grab her by the waist
And force them to meet face to face
One day he'll look into her eyes
And say that, "You're my only light"

[Chorus]
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I understand that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside
