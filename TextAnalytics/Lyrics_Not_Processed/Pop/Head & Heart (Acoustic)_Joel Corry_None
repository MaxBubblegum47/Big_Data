[Verse 1]
Oh my god, oh my god, this feeling's just begun
Saying things I’ve never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my god, oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it but it’s never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop

[Chorus]
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum (Oh, yeah)
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum (Mmm)

[Verse 2]
Oooh, oh my god, oh my god, can't believe what I've become
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think, singing songs I’ve never sung
Oh my god, oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I’m frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us (Feel about us)
Try to fight it but it's never enough (Never enough)
My heart is certain it’s more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop

[Chorus]
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum (Oh, yeah)
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum (Goes)
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum (Yeah)
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum (Oh)
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum (Goes, goes)
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

[Bridge]
My head and my heart
My head and my heart
Can't tell them apart
My head tells me to run, but I can’t

[Chorus]
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

[Outro]
Oh my god, oh my god, this feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
