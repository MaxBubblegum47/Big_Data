[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & ?]
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hands up far from (....)
Said I wouldn't let you see past 21 up
Said I'd be goin' 'cause I came from the same slum
Don't know where I came from
She probably wondering how
Is this your turn
Stains me now and move the crowd
Mama ain't raise no fool
My mine's  a diamond
I'm from the city of jewels

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
Refugee from Haiti
Flatboys to New Jersey
Then I got with Fugees
Now I'm with Avicii
Raised in them tenements
Speak for those less fortunate
Then I ran for president
Hands up if you with me

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & ?]
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Papa was a dishwasher
The peer pressure got me selling cocaina
One brick, two brick, three brick, four
I could have been the one boys came for
But now all we did is encores on tours
Brooklyn, Sweden to Istanbul
Life's a carnival, use my music
Or I sellout to blow and I pray for my rivals

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
Refugee from Haiti
Flatboys to New Jersey
Then I got with Fugees
Now I'm with Avicii
Raised in them tenements
Speak for those less fortunate
Then I ran for president
Hands up if you with me

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & ?]
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up

[Verse 3: ?]
On top of the morning
Underneath the sunlight
We come with a warning
Been doing it all night
You say it's a lifetime
Ain't nothing but an hour
We got the rhythm, got the rhythm, got the rhythm

[Bridge: ?]
And we say (woah)
And we say (woah)
And we say (woah)
And we say (woah)

[Pre-Chorus: ?]
Increasing the insanity
We came to be what we believe
And even though we're under fold
There ain't a soul without control

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & ?]
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up

[Instrumental]
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
Put your hands all the way up
All the way up
