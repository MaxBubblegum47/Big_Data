[Chorus: Nicole Miglis]
Don't let me show cruelty
Though I may make mistakes
Don't let me show ugliness
Though I know I can hate
And don't let me show evil
Though it might be all I take
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love

[Verse 1: Moses Sumney]
I got a crick in my neck, limp in my step
Crampin' in my muscles every time I try to flex
We're broken
Not really in the right mindset to seem open, open
Never really been fought out, like a politician martyr
But you made me listen to your petition rise
Love, let's get over
It's very sad, no more love
All that I could do was remember you
You know I usually say no
But if you throw me love, I'll throw you some more

[Chorus: Nicole Miglis]
Don't let me show cruelty
Though I may make mistakes
Don't let me show ugliness
Though I know I can hate
And don't let me show evil
Though it might be all I take
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Show me love when I pop out, when I pop out
City I always talk 'bout, what I rap 'bout
Show me love cause I love it, I love it
Only thing I could covet, in public
I just came to show love, you just glad I showed up
Boy respect your elder, I'm a fucking glo'n up
Foenem told me "Go nuts," bro'nem ain't for no none
But no talkin' at dinner, or to bacon that eat donuts
City on a come up, I might share my bonus
Cases of Coronas and my lil marijuana
I'm a face a whole dub, O-Zs for my soldiers
Tell them haters hold up, them niggas gotta show love

[Chorus: Nicole Miglis]
Don't let me show cruelty
Though I may make mistakes
Don't let me show ugliness
Though I know I can hate
And don't let me show evil
Though it might be all I take
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love

[Bridge: Nicole Miglis + Moses Sumney]
I see you
You see me
Heavy hands hanging on
Release me
Don't let the feeling that I'm all alone
Deceive me
Just let me in and show me love

[Chorus: Nicole Miglis]
And don't let me show evil
Though it might be all I take
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
And don't let me show evil
Though it might be all I take
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
