[Verse 1]
Kentucky Woman
She shines in her own kind of light
She looks at you once in a day
And what's wrong is alright
And I love her
God knows I love her

[Chorus]
Kentucky Woman
She gets to know you
She gets to hold you
Kentucky Woman

[Verse 2]
She isn't the kind to turn
At the drop of her name
Well all the things she does
They turn you on just the same
And I love her
God knows I love her

[Chorus]
Kentucky Woman
She gets to know you
She gets to hold you
Kentucky Woman

[Verse 3]
I don't want much
The Good Lord's earth
Beneath my feet, a gentle touch
Because that one girl in life
Is sweet and good
There isn't no doubt, I'm talking about

[Chorus]
Kentucky Woman
She gets to know you
She gets to hold you
Kentucky Woman

[Verse 4]
Kentucky Woman she shines
In her own kind of light
She looks at you once in a day
And what's wrong is alright
And I love her, yes I do, I love her

[Chorus]
Kentucky Woman
She gets to know you
She gets to hold you
Kentucky Woman
