Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
If I told you where the dope was
You ain't supposed to be here, nigga, you don't know us
See, boy, I am focused
In my garage makin' magic, this is hocus
Goin' loco, voodoo, I sue ya
The Devil gon' get ya if it's not the ruler
My black skin made me wanna dress more cooler
Hidin' alcohol inside my family's cooler, I'm tired of life, boy
Last night I had a dream, I put that on my whiteboard
For too damn long my life was McDonald's and white boys
Now it's like white noise, I need me some nice noise
I need me some nice coin, I need me some new clout
The gang niggas turn on you, fame niggas run from you
Laughin', hold my hand, baby, when it's convenient
I need me some street shit, fuck this PC shit, ah

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Oh, oh
Yeah, I don't wanna ride
Quit wastin' my time
I don't wanna ride
Quit wastin' my time, quit wastin' my time
Quit wastin' my time, quit, quit
