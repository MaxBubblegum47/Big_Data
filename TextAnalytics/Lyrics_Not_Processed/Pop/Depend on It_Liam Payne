[Intro]
We used to be lovin', touchin', kissin', f-
Like our lives depend on it
How we did get to lyin', cryin', always fightin'
Like our lives depend on it

[Verse 1]
Oh, there you go, putting words in my mouth
It's 'bout to go down
I'm not ready yet, there's still a thread left
If I could just hold on onto unraveling hope
Give it one last go, I don't know why, just need us to try

[Pre-Chorus]
Do or don't we find a way to get back
That thing we used to have that
Ooh, I need you now

[Chorus]
We used to be lovin', touchin', kissin', f-
Like our lives depend on it
How we did get to lyin', cryin', always fightin'
Like our lives depend on it
Why you lookin' at me with angry eyes
How we ever gon' make it out alive
If we don't get back to lovin', touchin', kissin', f-
Like our lives depend on it

[Verse 2]
How could I know, what you had hiding there
Behind those fire eyes, but I'll make it worse with my wild words

[Pre-Chorus]
And ooh, I've done it now

[Chorus]
We used to be lovin', touchin', kissin', f-
Like our lives depend on it
How we did get to lyin', cryin', always fightin'
Like our lives depend on it
Why you lookin' at me with angry eyes
How we ever gon' make it out alive
If we don't get back to lovin', touchin', kissin', f-
Like our lives depend on it

[Outro]
Why you lookin' at me with angry eyes
How we ever gon' make it out alive
If we don't get back to lovin', touchin', squeezin' then f-
Like our lives depend on it
