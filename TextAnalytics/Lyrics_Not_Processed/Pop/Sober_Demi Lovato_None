[Verse 1]
I got no excuses for all of these goodbyes
Call me when it's over 'cause I'm dying inside
Wake me when the shakes are gone
And the cold sweats disappear
Call me when it's over and myself has reappeared

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely

[Chorus]
Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before
I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry to my future love for the man that left my bed
For making love the way I saved for you inside my head
And I'm sorry for the fans I lost who watched me fall again
I wanna be a role model, but I'm only human

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely

[Chorus]
Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before
I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
Iâ€™m not sober anymore

[Outro]
I'm sorry that I'm here again, I promise I'll get help
It wasn't my intention, I'm sorry to myself
