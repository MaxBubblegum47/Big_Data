[Intro: Ina Wroldsen & MNEK]
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum
What you, what you gon' do?

[Verse 1: Ina Wroldsen]
You're my discretional sin
I feel you on me when I touch my skin
You got me hooked and you're reeling me in
When I look in your eyes, I'm on the edge

[Pre-Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
You're on my mind like a song that I can't escape
I don't know how many da-da-dums I can take
I need to know if you're feeling, feeling the same
Is it too late?

[Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
But now it's hard to breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a game we do
I tell myself I'm not that into you
But I don't wanna sleep, it's quarter after three

[Post-Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
You're in my head like
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
You're in my head like
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da

[Verse 2: Ina Wroldsen]
You're my obsession, my truth
I come alive whenever I'm with you
And now I dialed your number again
And you come over and over, and then

[Pre-Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
You're on my mind like a song that I can't escape
I don't know how many da-da-dums I can take
I need to know if you're feeling, feeling the same
Is it too late?

[Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
But now it's hard to breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a game we do
I tell myself I'm not that into you
But I don't wanna sleep, it's quarter after three
And now it's hard to breathe
We're not in love, it's just a thing we make
We're skin on skin, I need this spell to break
But I don't wanna go and I know that you know

[Post-Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
You're in my head like
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
You're in my head like
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da

[Bridge: Ina Wroldsen]
And now it's hard to breathe (Thing we make)
Breathe (Into you)
Breathe (Thing we make)
Breathe
And now it's hard to breathe (Thing we make)
Breathe (Into you)
Breathe (Thing we make)

[Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
And now it's hard to breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a game we do
I tell myself I'm not that into you
But I don't wanna sleep, it's quarter after three
I know it's hard to breathe
We're not in love, it's just a thing we make
Oh, we're skin on skin, I need to this spell to break
But I don't wanna go and I know that you know

[Post-Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
You're in my head like
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da, dum-dum-da-da-da
