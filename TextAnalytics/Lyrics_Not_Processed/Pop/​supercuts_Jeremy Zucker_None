[Verse 1]
I thought
I would be good by now
I'd have it figured all out
We'd skip the scenic route
And oh well
At least I never lied
Still, I'm always the bad guy
So much for being nice

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna be someone who makes you happy
Then lets you down, we'll both feel crappy
I'll hate your friends when this shit ends
Well, alright
And I don't wanna make your mama cry at dinner
And see her at the mall next winter
At Supercuts, she hates my guts
Well, alright

[Verse 2]
Well, I don't
Don't need a hand to hold
Don't need you to console me
It's honestly getting old
Well, I've thought
There's so many places we could go
Well, maybe I'm better off at home
Maybe I'm better on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna be someone who makes you happy
Then lets you down, we'll both feel crappy
I'll hate your friends when this shit ends
Well, alright
And I don't wanna make your mama cry at dinner
And see her at the mall next winter
At Supercuts, she hates my guts
Well, alright

[Bridge]
Find me drowning in this bullshit again
Started something that we're just gonna end
Wonder if we would be better as friends
But we won't

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna be someone who makes you happy
Then lets you down, we'll both feel crappy
I'll hate your friends when this shit ends
Well, alright
And I don't wanna make your mama cry at dinner
And see her at the mall next winter
At Supercuts, she hates my guts
Well, alright
