I've traveled the world until tonight
But I've never seen a stars come to life
But when I see you the sky turns light
And when the lights gone I'll drown in your eyes
Come with me I'll take you for a ride
Into the night I'll teach you how to fly
Let it go, I'll show you how to dice
So come with me I'll take you lit the light

You're my destination
You're my destination

I've traveled the world until tonight
But I've never seen a stars come to life
But when I see you the sky turns light
And when the lights gone I'll drown in your eyes
Come with me I'll take you for a ride
Into the night I'll teach you how to fly
Let it go, I'll show you how to dice
So come with me I'll take you lit the light
