[Verse]
I'm holding on to many things passed
To anything that's gonna change my memories back
I'm holding on to everyone good
To everything that's ever been the way that it should
I'm holding on to things you said
Before you forgot what this love really meant to you
The words that I sent to you, never got into you
No matter how hard I try, try

[Chorus]
No matter how hard I try, try
No matter how hard I try, try
No matter how hard I try
No matter how hard I try, try, try
No matter how hard I try
(How hard I try)
(How hard I try)
(How hard I try)

[Verse]
I’m holding on to many things passed
To anything that's gonna change my memories back
I’m holding on to everyone good
To everything that's ever been the way that it should
I'm holding on to things you said
Before you forgot what this love really meant to you
The words that I sent to you, never got into you
No matter how hard I try, try

[Chorus]
No matter how hard I try, try
No matter how hard I try, try
No matter how hard I try
No matter how hard I try, try, try
No matter how hard I try
(How hard I try)
(How hard I try)
(How hard I try)
