[Intro: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci
Fifth Harmony

[Verse 1: Lauren]
I need somebody with some patience
'Cause you know I got a temperament
And yeah, you got a reputation
Nothin' that a little love can't fix
There ain't no kind of situation
Where I wouldn't cross a line for you
FBI interrogation
I would get up there and lie for you

[Pre-Chorus: Dinah]
When push come to shove
You show me love
When push come to shove, ayy

[Chorus: Lauren and Normani]
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you

[Verse 2: Normani]
You the type that I could bake for (bake for)
'Cause baby, you know how to take that cake (cake, cake)
And I'm the only one you wait for
'Cause baby, you know that I'm worth that wait

[Pre-Chorus: Ally & Lauren]
When push come to shove
You show me love (you show me love)
When push come to shove, ayy

[Chorus: Lauren and Normani & Gucci Mane]
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down (it's Gucci)
I'm gon' keep lovin' you

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's like Bonnie and Clyde just walked in
A gangster and his bride just walked in
We on the same team and we ballin'
Got me showin' off my ring like I'm Jordan
And I'ma hold you down like you hold me
And I'll never tell a soul what you told me
When I was sittin' in the cell is when you showed me
It takes a real one to put up with the old me
That's why you in the coupe with the low seat
That's why we at the game on the floor seats
My diamond that they seein' from the nosebleeds
You make a man feel like he won a trophy

[Chorus: All]
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
(I'ma love you down)
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down, yeah
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
(I'm gon' love you down)
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're lovin' me boy

[Outro: Lauren]
I'm gon' keep lovin' you
