[Verse 1]
I don't know if we should be alone together
I still got a crush, that's obvious
If nobody's around, what's stopping us?
Everywhere I go you show whatever
I don't ever mind sharing oxygen
I just wanna get lost in your lungs

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Just a baby, but she's growing up so fast
And I'm allergic to the waiting
She's just a baby girl
And I love to watch her dance
But it's making me go crazy

[Chorus]
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?

[Verse 2]
I don't think that we should be around each other
When you're in the room, you get my eyes
You open your mouth, I'm hypnotized
I can make you laugh until you cry
You know you got all my attention
You know you got all mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
"Baby," I can't help but call her that
Even though I shouldn't say it
She was my baby girl
Might never get her back
But I don't mind being patient, yeah

[Chorus]
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?

[Bridge]
Okay
I'm just gonna tell you what I gotta say
Right here
I'm sorry Dave, I never meant to hurt your baby girl
She's your little baby, she's my soulmate
I don't want you to worry, she'll be so safe right here
Oh, so
Dave, would you let your baby be my girl?

[Chorus]
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?
Your baby, she's mine
