[Intro]
I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you

[Verse 1]
Why can't I tell if you're into me
I'm on nine, you're on five
Been away for a couple of weeks
It could be more cause I lost track of time
Driving on the wrong side thinking of you
On the tenth floor thinking of you
And it isn't like me to be insecure
Oh, what have you done to my mind? Whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be with you, wanna be with you
Oh my god, I'm a mess
Boy you got to me, got to me
You know you got to me

[Chorus]
Tried to forget about you and no chance
I wasn't looking for a romance
Blue skies but I'm in the dark
Waiting on some other guy to pick me up
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you

[Verse 2]
In the hills with the windows down
Telling me he wants to show me around
He knows somebody with a fancy house
On the playlist, soon to be famous
He took me to the beach, I was thinking of you
Standing in his room but I was thinking of you
And I don't want you to be insecure
Oh, don't wanna play with your mind, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be with you, wanna be with you
Oh my god, I'm a mess
Boy you got to me, got to me
You know you got to me, oh

[Chorus]
Tried to forget about you and no chance
I wasn't looking for a romance
Blue skies but I'm in the dark
Waiting on some other guy to pick me up
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
I'm thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking of you

[Bridge]
Ooh, I'm coming right back
Tell all your friends that I'm coming right back
Ooh, I'm coming right back
You're enough to make me turn around and backtrack
Ooh, I'm coming right back
Tell all your friends that I'm coming right back
Ooh, I'm coming right back
You're enough to make me turn around

[Chorus]
Tried to forget about you and no chance
I wasn't looking for a romance
Blue skies but I'm in the dark
Waiting on some other guy to pick me up
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you
Forget about you and no chance
I wasn't looking for a romance
Blue skies but I'm in the dark
Waiting on some other guy to pick me up
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you

[Outro]
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you
Ooh, oh, whoa-oh
Thinking of you, thinking of you
