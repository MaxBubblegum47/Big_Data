[Verse 1]
Twentysomething aluminum cans
Tied behind a 1920-something jet black Cadillac, yeah
Two twenty-something year old kids, right here
Real life begins with a camera flash and confetti kiss

[Chorus]
You, me, twentysomething
That old engine running
Ride off to the sunset
Rollin' bout twentysomething
Won't look back for nothing
All in, whatever love is, don't know
There's just something, something 'bout twentysomething

[Verse 2]
Twentysomething minutes out
We scraped up that twentysomething percent down
On twenty million things to fix
It's a lot of love and a couple tears
It'll be all ours in twentysomething years

[Bridge]
Feels like we're crazy
But ain't that the dream
Yeah we might be crazy
But baby there's something about you and me

[Verse 3]
You, me, twentysomething
We got a little one coming
Try to raise 'em up good and before we know it
They'll be twentysomething
Same wide eyes that we had
Fall in love and find out something
Something 'bout twentysomething

[Bridge]
Feels like we're crazy
But ain't that the dream (yes it is)
Yeah we might be crazy
But baby there's something about you and me

[Verse 4]
We love like crazy
That's all we need
Don't care what we're facing, girl, we'll make it
'Cause baby there's something about you and me
Girl there's just something about you and me
Twentysomething
