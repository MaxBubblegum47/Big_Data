[Verse 1: Samantha Gongol]
It's 2AM and I am trying to sleep
You told me later you were thinking of me
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna live without it
You told me later you were thinking...

[Chorus: Samantha Gongol]
It's a subtle thing
When you look at me
It's a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing

[Verse 2: Samantha Gongol]
I always see you when I'm out on the street
I wanna talk and you appear on my screen
Dreaming like a broken record
Looping on your note forever
You told me later you were thinking...

[Chorus: Samantha Gongol]
It's a subtle thing
When you look at me
It's a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing

[Bridge: Samantha Gongol]
We always play in tune
I love the way we move
Heard your favorite record on the day before we met
(I'll never play with you)
Every time I hear it now I kinda start to sweat
(We always play)
Wanna call you over when I feel you getting closer
(In tune)
Are you missing me?

[Chorus: Samantha Gongol]
It's a subtle thing
When you look at me
It's a subtle thing
Such a subtle thing
(It's a subtle thing)
(It's a subtle thing)
Such a subtle thing
