[Verse 1: Nick Jonas & 
Joe Jonas
]
One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out if it was
One of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & 
Joe Jonas
]
He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick Jonas]
We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
(Seventh album, seventh album)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine, oh

[Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and 
Kevin Jonas
]
He said, I've been to the year 3000 
(Yeah, yeah)
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater 
(Oh, yeah)
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, 
doing fine, doing fine

[Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and 
Kevin Jonas
]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater 
(Oh, yeah)
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine
