[Verse 1]
You didn't see my valentine
I sent it via pantomime
While you were watching someone else
I stared at you and cut myself
That's all I'll do cause I'm not free
A fugitive too dull to flee
I'm amorous but out of reach
A still life drawing of a peach

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a tulip in a cup
I stand no chance of growing up
I've made my peace, I'm dead, I'm done
I watch you live to have my fun

[Chorus]
I root for you, I love you
You you you you
I root for you, I love you
You you you you

[Verse 2]
I made it to a dinner date
My teardrops seasoned every plate
I tried to dance but lost my nerve
I cramped up in the learning curve

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a tulip in a cup
I stand no chance of growing up
I'm resigned to sail on through
In the wake of tales of you

[Chorus]
I root for you, I love you
You you you you
I root for you, I love you
You you you
I root for you, I love you
You you you, you you you you
I root for you, I love you
You you you
