[Intro: SiR]
ねえ、聞いてる？
ねえ、誰かいる？
一緒に時間を過ごしたいんだけど
仕事後にしてくれない？
聞こえないふりしないで
聞こえてるのわかってるよ
Let's see what happens next time you checkin' for me
Fuck you say?
I'm just gon' call my other nigga

[Chorus: Zacari]
And I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
Do anything for the cash (Ah), bills
Do anything for the cash
And I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
Do anything for the cash (Ah), bills
Do anything for the cash

[Verse 1: SiR]
Give me space, let me breathe
Never gon' rest if you never gon' let me
I understand it's what you need (What you need, 
最低
)
But it won't be my best if I ain't got nothin' left
Baby, I can't lie, I got money on my mind
(Baby, I can't lie, I got money on my mind)
You love spendin' time, you ain't gotta spend a dime
Long as we're in rhythm, you don't care about the rhyme
When it's low flame, you want me to heat it up
Tyson in the ring, you want me to beat it up
How you like it, I know how you like it
Girl, I shine the brightest
But only when I'm fired up

[Chorus: Zacari]
And I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
Do anything for the cash (Ah), bills
Do anything for the cash
And I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
Do anything for the cash (Ah), bills
Do anything for the cash

[Verse 2: SiR]
(
I don't even know why I deal with your dumbass
)
You ain't gotta tell me, baby, I know I'm your favorite
It's all fun and games, but I ain't the one to play with
No reason to worry, what you worried 'bout?
All our lil' problems I be workin' out
Don't you love to put on a show?
When I don't give you your affection you be fussin' and more
Talkin' 'bout why don't I give you somethin' to talk about?
Soon as you get my attention, you know it's goin' down, oh

[Chorus: Zacari]
And I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
Do anything for the cash (Ah), bills
Do anything for the cash
And I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
I ain't in the mood if I ain't in my bag
Do anything for the cash (Ah), bills
Do anything for the cash
