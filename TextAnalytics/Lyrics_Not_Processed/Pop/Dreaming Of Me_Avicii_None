You're flying high
But I'm falling to pieces
Trapped under your spell
Until it releases
I'm drowning without your love
Oh, sweet suffocation
Are you real?
Are you real?
Are you real?
Are you real?
Are you really my creation?
Well there I go
Dreaming that dream again
But it seems so real, to taste, to feel this love I'm in
I know you're out there somewhere dreaming of me
I know you're out there dreaming of me
I know you're out there somewhere dreaming of me
I know you're out there dreaming of me
Here I go
