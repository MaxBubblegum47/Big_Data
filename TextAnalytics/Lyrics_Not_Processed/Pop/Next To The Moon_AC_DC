Well i tied my baby to the railroad track
Cannonball down the line
Giving that woman just a one more chance
To give it to me one more time
Engineer wishing he was home in bed
Dreaming about casey jones
Wide-eyed woman heading a mile ahead [...woman half a mile ahead]
Thinking about broken bones
It's her love that i want
It's her love that i need
It's her love got to have
It's her love
Heavenly body flying across the sky
Superman was out of town
Come on honey, gotta change your tune
Cause it's a long way down
Clark kent looking for a free ride
Thinking about lois lane
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's - a suicide
And that'd be a shame
It's her love that i want
It's her love that i need
It's her love got to have
It's her love
But what's next to the moon?
Long arm looking for a fingerprint
Trying to find the mystery clue
Hitting me with the third degree
Working on a thumb screw
Alright, officer, i confess
Everything's coming back
I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
It was a heart attack
It's her love that i want
It's her love that i need
It's her love got to have
It's her love
What's next to the moon?
