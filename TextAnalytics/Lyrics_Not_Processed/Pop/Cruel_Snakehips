[Verse 1: ZAYN]
Cab radio screaming, noise and tears
Death on the TV, and then there's you
It's fucked, it's crazy, I can't concentrate, I just see your outline Mmm

[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN]
Back where we left off, watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself, remembering you
Your body hurts me, loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet

[Chorus: ZAYN]
It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
It's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl

[Verse 2: ZAYN]
Some prick at the party, all scripts and boasts
A dead eyed actress girl, and then there's you
Venus in Converse, you put a spell on me
And you're lockin' up the bathroom door for us

[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN]
Back where we left off, watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself, remembering you
Your body hurts me, loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet

[Chorus: ZAYN]
It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
It's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl

[Bridge: ZAYN]
Who do you love? Who do you love?
Who do you love? Who do you love?
Just see your outline

[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN]
Back where we left off, help you take your dress off
I've been by myself, remembering you
Your body hurts me, loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet

[Chorus: ZAYN]
It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
It's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl

[Outro: ZAYN]
Sunrise in Hollywood, we ain't slept for days
Perfect disaster, me and you
