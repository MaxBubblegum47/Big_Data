[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
I know you gon' be the one that's gon' hold me down (Down)
When it's time to put in work you know I'm always 'round ('Round)
Tote that Glock, hold that work, baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me (Love me, love me)
Baby, do you trust me? Do you trust me?
Baby, do you trust me? (Trust me, skrrt, skrrt) Baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me (Love me, love me)

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
I'ma make you love me, baby, do you trust me?
Come in close and hug me (Hug me), tell that hoe don't test me
I don't play 'bout mines, watch this shit get messy
Tote that Glock (Glock), hide it in my spot
Bitch, stop playing, I'ma leave you hot
Rubber bands wrapped around these knots
Bitch, stop playing, watch me kill the parking lot

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
I know you gon' be the one that's gon' hold me down (Down)
