[Verse 1]
Trippin' out, spinnin' around
I'm underground, I fell down
Yeah, I fell down
I'm freakin' out, where am I now?
Upside down and I can't stop it now
It can't stop me now, oh

[Chorus]
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry

[Bridge]
I found myself (myself) in Wonderland
Get back on (back on) my feet again
Is this real? (this real) Is it pretend?
I'll take a stand (a stand) until the end

[Chorus]
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry

[Chorus]
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I, and I won't cry
