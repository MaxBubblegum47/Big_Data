[Verse 1]
I told myself I couldn’t do it
Face another day when I knew it
All too well and all too soon
You were taken from my life
It's like you get used to the pain
You can’t see the sun shining in the rain
So I smile and keep it inside
‘Cause I don’t wanna cry

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you were my friend, until the end
But now I have to let you go

[Chorus]
Please tell me why I write these lines
When you’re nothing but a memory that burns a hole
Deep inside my mind and I keep these words to myself
And when I close my eyes
I miss you more, I miss you more
More than words can say

[Verse 2]
Tell me what it takes and I’ll do it (I’ll do it)
I close my eyes ’cause I wanna get through this (Get through this)
And now your face is just a faded photograph
Sometimes, something's so good that it can't last (Can't last)
So many things I wanted to show you (Show you)
So many things I wanted to tell you (To tell you)
You're in my heart, I just want you to know (To know)
A piece of you is with me wherever I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Now it’s just too late
I have the chance to say goodbye
But then I let it slip away

[Chorus]
Please tell me why I write these lines
When you’re nothing but a memory that burns a hole
Deep inside my mind and I keep these words to myself
And when I close my eyes
I miss you more, I miss you more
More than words can say

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Please tell me why I write these lines
When you’re nothing but a memory that burns a hole
Deep inside my mind and I keep these words to myself
And when I close my eyes
I miss you more, I miss you more
More than words can say
And I don’t know why, but I feel like the way I do
It’s all too much and I just need some time
To not keep these words to myself
And when I close my eyes
I miss you more, I miss you more
More than words can say
