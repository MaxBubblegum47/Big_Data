If I ever get a chance
To see the whole world
On the back of a dream I had
I'll know one thing
You're never gonna guess
It doesn't matter what else you learn
If she's still home
When you stay gone
Pretty soon it gets
To be way too long and I
Almost let her get away
But now that I'm here to stay she's my
Oh my
Juliet
I thought that I lost you to distance
But here you are
Still wishing on shooting stars
Juliet
I said a lot of things that I might regret
If I ever get a chance
So I never want a chance again
Yea
Juliet
I thought that I lost you to distance
But here you are
Still wishing on
Still wishing on
Me
That I might let go
Of everything you did
But I might say no
And yes I know
Now you're a lady
Still I got you telling me
Don't say maybe
Don't say, don't say maybe
Come on now
Please don't hate me
Come on now
I don't want a lazy
Somebody save me
Braindead Brady, yea
So this one goes
To the one that I always kept close
Almost let her get away
But if I stay she's my
Oh my
Juliet
I thought that I lost you to distance
But here you are
Still wishing on shooting stars
Juliet
I said a lot of things that I might regret
If I ever get a chance
So I never want a chance again
Yea
Juliet
I thought that I lost you to distance
But here you are
Still wishing on
Still wishing on me
I should tell the world but I don't
I should tell the, I should tell the world but I don't, don't
Oh my
I should tell the world but I don't
I should tell the, I should tell the world but I don't, don't
I should tell the world but I
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't
I should tell the world but I don't ...
(Yea, yea, Oh my)
Juliet
I thought that I lost you to distance
But here you are
Still wishing on shooting stars
Juliet
I said a lot of things that I might regret
If I ever get a chance
So I never want a chance again
Yea
Juliet
I thought that I lost you to distance
But here you are
Still wishing on
Still wishing on me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't
I should tell the world but I
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't
I should tell the world but I ...
