[Intro]
We were too young to know we had everything
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along
I’m sorry that I hurt you, darling, no, oh
We were too young

[Verse 1]
I've been looking back a lot lately
Me and you is all I've ever known
It’s hard to think you could ever hate me
But everything's feeling different now

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't believe I gave in to the pressure
When they said a love like this would never las
t
So I cut you off 'cause I didn't know no better
Now I realize, yeah, I realize

[Chorus]
We were too young to know we had everything
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along
I'm sorry that I hurt you, darling, no, oh
We were too young 
(Ooh, ah)
We were too young 
(Ooh, ah)
We were too young

[Verse 2]
Face to face at the kitchen table
This is everything I've waited for
Now we can finally have a conversation
That I wish we could’ve had before

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can’t believe I gave in to the pressure
When they said a love like this would never last
So I cut you off 'cause I didn’t know no better
Now I realize, yeah, I realize

[Chorus]
We were too young to know we had everything
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along
I'm sorry that I hurt you, darling, no, oh
We were too young 
(Ooh, ah)
We were too young 
(Ooh, ah)
We were too young

[Bridge]
It's been two years since I’ve seen your face
I'm tryna find some better words to say
Before I let this moment slip away
'Cause now I realize

[Chorus]
We were too young to know we had everything
Too young, I wish I could've seen it all along
I'm sorry that I hurt you
, darling, no, oh
We were too young 
(Ooh, ah)
We were too young 
(Ooh, ah)
We were too young 
(Ooh, ah)
We were too young 
(Ooh, ah)
We were too young
