[Verse 1: Emma & 
Jackson
]
I am the queen of overthinking
That's why I'm always drinking
Something to get me
Outta my head, outta my head
Tonight, I'm tryna make bad choices
So I can drown these voices
Wish I could get them
Outta my head, outta my head

[Pre-Chorus: Emma]
I'm sorry, I don't talk then I talk too much
But you get me

[Chorus: Emma & 
Jackson
]
Baby, you get me out
When I don't wanna leave my house
You get me outta my head
(You get me out my head)
When I don't wanna leave my bed
You get me outta my head
So let me get in yours
Outta my head, outta my head
I think I like you, babe
You get me out, right out my head
You save me from myself
So let me get in yours

[Verse 2: Emma & 
Jackson
]
I am too young to be this stressed out
Tell me to wear this dress out
Somehow you get me
Outta my head, outta my head
Well I say, you spend too much on makeup
Look the best way you wake up
That's why we don't get
Outta my bed, outta my bed

[Pre-Chorus: Jackson]
I'm sorry, I don't talk then I talk too much
But you get me

[Chorus: Emma & 
Jackson
]
Baby, you get me out
When I don't wanna leave my house
You get me outta my head
(You get me out my head)
When I don't wanna leave my bed
You get me outta my head
So let me get in yours
Outta my head, outta my head
I think I like it
You get me out my, right out my head
You save me from myself
So let me get in yours

[Post-Chorus: Emma & Jackson]
Pour it up, pour it up
Then act like this is my shit
You get me outta my head, I think I like it
Pour it up, pour it up
Then act like this is my shit
You get me outta my head, I think I like it

[Bridge: Emma]
I am the queen of overthinking
You're never sick of listening
Even when I get outta my head (Outta my head)

[Pre-Chorus: Emma]
I'm sorry, I don't talk, then I talk too much
But you get me

[Chorus: Emma & Jackson]
Baby, you get me out (Baby, you get me out)
When I don't wanna leave my house (Don't wanna leave my house)
You get me outta my head (Get me outta my head)
When I don't wanna leave my bed
You get me outta my head
So let me get in yours

[Post-Chorus: Emma & Jackson]
Pour it up, pour it up
Then act like this is my shit
You get me outta my head, I think I like it
Pour it up, pour it up
Then act like this is my shit
You get me outta my head, I think I like it
