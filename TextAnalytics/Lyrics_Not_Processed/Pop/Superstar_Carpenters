[Verse 1]
Long ago and oh so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
It's just the radio

[Chorus]
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do

[Verse 2]
Loneliness is a such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait to be with you again
What to say to make you come again
Come back to me again
And play your sad guitar

[Chorus]
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do
