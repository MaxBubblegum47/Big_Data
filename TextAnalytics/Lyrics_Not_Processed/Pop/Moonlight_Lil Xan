[Intro: Lil Xan]
(Ear Drummers)
Yeah, ayy, brrr
Yeah, yeah, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
Under the moonlight
She said she felt the mood right
And said, "Is everything right?"
We drunk up off that moonshine
We look up at the star lights
She look just like the star shine
I gave that bitch my sunshine
It's peakin' through the highrise
It's peakin' through that (yeah)
Ayy, but it don't mean shit if you ain't happy, though
Happiness is all that matters, yes, I hope you know
And fuck it, let's just see what happens, take a risk, let's take a trip
We swervin' off the bourbon, hope we don't hit the dip

[Verse 1: Lil Xan]
Ayy, on my Post Malone shit
Now I got my own bitch
Money that I spent so now you know I fuckin' own shit
Yeah, I'm on my own, feelin' lone, drink Patron
Got them evil bitches all up in my motherfuckin' zone
Ayy, ayy, and why you never answer phones?
Ayy, ayy and yeah, I'm chillin' home alone
Back in high school she didn't want me, now that shit changed
Now her family show me praise
That shit seem like super strange

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Lil Xan]
Under the moonlight
She said she felt the mood right
She said, "Is everything right?"
We drunk up off that moonshine
We look up at the star lights (yeah)
She look just like the star shine (ayy, ayy)
I gave that bitch my sunshine
It's peakin' through the highrise (ayy)
It's peakin' through the (yeah)
Ayy, but it don't mean shit if you ain't happy, though
Happiness is all that matters, yes, I hope you know
And fuck it, let's just see what happens, take a risk, let's take a trip
We swervin' off the bourbon, hope we don't hit the dip

White Mercedes
, whip it
Do 150, hope I do not crash
Fuck that bitch then hit the dash (
dash
)
Fuck that bitch then hit the dash (
dash
)
I be on my superhero, baby
Let's just 
fly away
Go away
If you 
broke
 my 
heart
, I hope you 
go away
White Mercedes, whip it
Watch me strippin', press up on the glass
Do it good, I'm on the dash
Put you right up on the dash
I be on my Al Pacino level, high as fuck today
Robbery, if you break my heart, you better run away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Lil Xan]
Yeah, under the moonlight
She said she felt the mood right
I told her hold my hand
She said, "Is everything right?"
We drunk up off that moonshine
We look up at the star lights (yeah)
She look just like the star shine (ayy, ayy)
Ayy, but it don't mean shit if you ain't happy, though
Happiness is all that matters, yes, I hope you know
And fuck it, let's just see what happens, take a risk, let's take a trip
We swervin' off the bourbon, hope we don't hit the dip

[Verse 3: Charli XCX]
Yeah, yeah, Marilyn Monroe shit
Blow you away, blow you away, like you alive shit
Wear a white dress, rip it off, lay me down in the grass shit
Fuckin' it up good, 4 AM, swimming pool after dark shit
Summer nights, 
Pacific Highway
'Cause I just really wanna pull you close
Always love the things I lose the most
Oh, oh, oh
Fall in love and then we let it go
Always love the things I lose the most, yeah
Hop in the ride, ruh, ruh
