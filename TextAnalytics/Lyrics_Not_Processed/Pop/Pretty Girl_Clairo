[Verse 1]
Polaroid of you dancing in my room
I want to remember
I think it was about noon
It's getting harder to understand, to understand
How you felt in my hands (in my hands)

[Chorus]
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
And I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you

[Verse 2]
I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinking 'bout the fool that I was
I was such a fool
I'm alone now but it's better for me
I don't need all your negativity

[Chorus]
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll never make you blue
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you
