[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Stop, oh

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Stop tellin' lies on me, that shit ain't okay, hey, hey, hey
Stop tellin' lies on me, that shit ain't okay, hey, hey, hey
Lil' bitch
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no leverage
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no leverage
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no leverage

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Ayy, who the fuck said I ain't him?
Got a new deposit, nigga, I ain't them
They playing with the shit and I don't see no wins
I'm tryna get the pussy, mami, one more 'gain, ayy
I fucked it up, I make enough, my rims, my truck
My roof is stuck, my house, my luck
My bitch, my yard, my cash enlarged, ayy
Left the bitch attitude at the old place
488, yeah, with the road rage
Nine on my lap, I ain't never play it safe
I ain't gotta rap to you niggas, been straight
You ain't Q
Lying for the 'Gram, bitch, you ain't cute
Hate this, hate that, that ain't cool
Said I did you dirty, but that ain't true, ayy

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & YG]
Stop tellin' lies on me, that shit ain't okay, hey, hey, hey
Stop tellin' lies on me, that shit ain't okay, hey, hey, hey
Lil' bitch
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no leverage (Uh)
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no leverage
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no leverage (It's YG, 4hunnid)

[Verse 2: YG]
You said I hit it raw, you lyin'
You said I ate them drawers, you lyin'
Reachin' for the stars, you tryin'
The homegirls wanna beat your ass and now you hiding
I fucked you once, once enough
I beat it up, then left you stuck
We not in touch, you mad as fuck
I'ma try to stop thinking with my dickhead for once, ayy
You want some rapper dick for the clout
She wanna be seen when you take her out
You from LA but you made it to the South
Fresh off the flight 'cause you just got flewed out
Damn, find out your Instagram a lie (It's a lie)
You fucked up my vibe (Fucked up my vibe)
Can't fuck with you 'cause I got too much pride (Too much pride)
Go Gucci Mane, get the fuck out my ride

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Stop tellin' lies on me, that shit ain't okay, hey, hey, hey
Stop tellin' lies on me, that shit ain't okay, hey, hey, hey
Lil' bitch
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no leverage
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no leverage
You ain't got no, you ain't got no, you ain't got no leverage
