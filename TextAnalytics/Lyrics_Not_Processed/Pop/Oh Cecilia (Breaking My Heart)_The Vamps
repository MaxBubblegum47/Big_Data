[Intro: The Vamps]
Cecilia, you’re breaking my heart
You’re shaking my confidence daily

[Verse 1: Brad]
Put your hands up, you’re surrounded
The whole love thing, I clowned it
Then who’s the joker? I guess I’m it
Cause I let it right go when I found it
Time has never been my best suit
Now I’ve got everything except you
You moved out of my heart, still got the bruise
I’d give it all back to be next to you

[Pre-Chorus: Brad]
I turn my radio up and it’s just my luck,
Why-y-y-y-y-y me??
I turn my TV on, it’s the same old song, why are you following me?
It’s like a "Missing you" sign is written on my face
Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh?
It’s like everybody knows cause everywhere I go the whole world is singing to me, yeah

[Chorus: The Vamps]
Cecilia, you’re breaking my heart
You’re shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I’m down on my knees
I’m begging you please to come home
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh

[Verse 2: Brad & Shawn Mendes]
I had the girl of my dreams and now she’s all gone
Thought that we could last forever, I was all wrong
Said the talking was cheap and now I'm flat broke
She don’t even wanna see my face anymore
She don’t wanna say, where she's gone away
But she’s on replay in my, in my brain
I’ll do what it takes any time and place
We can turn a breakup into an outbreak

[Pre-Chorus: Brad & Shawn Mendes]
I turn my radio up and it’s just my luck,
Why-y-y-y-y-y me?
I turn my TV on, it’s the same old song, why are you following me?
It’s like a "Missing you" sign is written on my face
Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh?
It’s like everybody knows cause everywhere I go the whole world is singing to me, yeah

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & All]
Cecilia, you’re breaking my heart
You’re shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I’m down on my knees
I’m begging you please to come home
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh

[Bridge: Brad]
Although we’re many miles apart but I still feel her
There’ll never be another one like my Cecilia
Oh where, oh where could she be? Does she still care about me?
When will she finally come back to, come back to me?

[Chorus: All]
Cecilia, you’re breaking my heart
You’re shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I’m down on my knees
I’m begging you please to come home
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
