Little girl you know that I've been watchin' you
Tryin' hard to catch my baby's eye
Since the party started you've been after him
And I can see you wanna steal my guy
And it's kind of fun to watch you try
So keep on dancing little girl
Keep on dancing little girl
'Round and around now little girl
Keep on dancing little girl
You're only wasting time he's all mine
He loves me keep on dancing little girl
You think you're gonna take his love away from me
Just because you dance the way you do
Don't you see he hasn't even looked your way
So you can try until the night is through
But baby he ain't going home with you
So keep on dancing little girl
Keep on dancing little girl
'Round and 'round now little girl
Keep on dancng little girl
You're only wasting time he's all mine
He loves me keep on dancing little girl
Keep on dancing (repeat and fade out)
