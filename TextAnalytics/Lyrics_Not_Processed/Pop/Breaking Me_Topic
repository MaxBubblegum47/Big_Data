[Intro]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
Call me what you wanna, I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times, eh-eh
Fallin' for another, I don't even bother
I could do it all my life

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me if you wanna 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess heaven's not that far away

[Chorus]
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
The rhythm that you play when you're breaking my heart
You know that I can't get you out of my system
Yeah, right from the start, you played with my heart
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me

[Verse 2]
You can do whatever, I'll be here forever
Spinning 'round inside this room, eh-eh
Won't you come on over? I'm a sucker for ya
Wishing we'll be out here soon

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me if you wanna 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess heaven's not that far away

[Chorus]
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
The rhythm that you play when you're breaking my heart
You know that I can't get you out of my system
Yeah, right from the start, you played with my heart
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me
