[Verse 1]
Highway run into the midnight sun
Wheels go round and round
, you're on my mind
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight
Sending all my love along the wire

[Chorus]
They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours, faithfully

[Drum + Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Circus life under the big top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time, always another show
Wondering where I am, lost without you

[Chorus]
And being apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours, faithfully

[Outro]
Whoa, oh-oh-ooh
Whoa, oh-oh-ooh, oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-whoooooa-oh
Faithfully
I'm still yours
I'm forever yours
Ever yours
Faithfully
