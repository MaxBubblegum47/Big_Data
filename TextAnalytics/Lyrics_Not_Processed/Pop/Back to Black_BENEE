[Verse 1]
He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet with his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry, get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked, I'll go back to black

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to us

[Verse 2]
I love you much, it's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I diеd a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
Wе only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to

[Bridge]
Black, black, black

[Chorus]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I, I go back to
I go back to black
