[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Verse 2]
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

{Instrumental bridge}

[Verse 3]
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do)
Round and round and round and round and round

[Verse 4]
And he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

[Chorus]
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Outro]
Ooh (Round and round and round)
Ooh (Round and round and round)
