[Verse 1]
I can remember a time when I was so afraid
When even my shadow wouldn't follow me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So I, I, I'm picking up my sword
To shatter all the pieces that I was before
Cause I, I, I'm worth fighting for
For, for, for

[Chorus]
So put me in a cage, lock me in a room
Throw away the key, I dare you
I'll break down the walls, a high heel wrecking ball
And I won't let you tear me down, no
Oh, oh, throw away the key, I dare you
Oh, oh and I won't let you tear me down, no

[Verse 2]
I had an opinion, but I never spoke my mind
And I wouldn't argue, even when I knew I was right

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I'm not that girl anymore
Yeah, I lost the battle but I won the war
Cause I, I, I'm worth fighting for
For, for, for

[Chorus]
So put me in a cage, lock me in a room
Throw away the key, I dare you
I'll break down the walls, a high heel wrecking ball
And I won't let you tear me down, no
Oh, oh, throw away the key, I dare you
Oh, oh and I won't let you tear me down, no

[Bridge]
I just kept on running, running, running
Trying to find out who I was
I would go the distance but it wasn't far enough
But now I'm standing straight and know exactly who I am
Yeah, yeah
I can remember a time when I was so afraid

[Chorus]
Put me in a cage, lock me in a room
Throw away the key, I dare you
I'll break down the walls, a high heel wrecking ball
And I won't let you tear me down, no
Oh, oh, throw away the key, I dare you
Oh, oh and I won't let you tear me down, no
I won't let you tear me down, no
I won't let you tear me down, no
Oh, oh
