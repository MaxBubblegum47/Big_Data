[Verse 1]
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Verse 2]
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Bridge]
Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

[Outro]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
