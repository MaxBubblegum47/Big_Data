[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep, it's my lullaby
Sometimes I drive so fast
Just to feel the danger
I wanna scream, it makes me feel alive

[Chorus]
Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please

[Verse 2]
To walk within the lines
Would make my life so boring
I want to know that I have been to the extreme
(Knock me) So knock me off my feet (My feet)
C'mon now, give it to me
Anything to make me feel alive

[Chorus]
Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please

[Bridge]
Let down your defenses, use no common sense
If you look, you will see
That this world is a beautiful, accident, turbulent
Succulent, opulent, permanent, no way
I wanna taste it, don't wanna waste it away

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep, it's my lullaby

[Chorus]
Is it enough? Is it enough?
Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please
Is it enough?
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please, oh
I'd rather be anything but ordinary, please
