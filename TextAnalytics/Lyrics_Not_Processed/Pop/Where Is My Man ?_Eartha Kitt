I don't wanna be alone - where is my baby?
I don't wanna be alone - where is my man?
I spend hours by the phone - where is my baby?
I chew my fingers to the bone - where is my man?
I need a man who can take me then tount me and make me

Buy the things that I so richly deseerrve
A man who knows what I require
The things that I desire -
Is there anyone out there who has the neerrve?
I spend hours by the phone - where is my baby?
I chew my fingers to the bone - where is my man?

Where is my baby? He can't be far
Look for an Ascot
A big cigar
Tell him to find me

Send his car to this address
I have to stress I need him now

I don't wanna be alone - where is my baby?
I don't wanna be alone - where is my man?
The kind of man that I adore's the kind of man that gives me more

Of all the better things in life that aren't free
Such things as summer by the sea
The Hamptons
Malibu
Capri

The kind of man
Who comes alive
When he comes near Rodeo Drive
Is the kind of man
Who winds my heart
With style and class

You know I've tried
Some other men
The kind with zeros
Less than ten
But everytime I grab
The ring it's always brass

I don't wanna be alone -
Where is my baby? . . 
I don't wanna be alone -
Where is my baby?
