[Verse 1]
I always fear that I'm not living right
So I feel guilty when I go to church
The pastor tells me I've been saved, I'm fine
Then please explain to me why my chest still hurts
I spent four thousand on the Mart McFlys
Yet I'm still petrified of going broke
There's someone gorgeous in my bed tonight
Yet I'm still petrified that I'll die alone

[Chorus]
I'm just so sick of being human
I'm just so sick of being human
I'm just so sick of being human
I'm just so sick of being...

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na-na, oh, nay
Nan, nan, nan, nan
Ooh, ah-ah, aye

[Verse 2]
My mother calls I have no time to talk
But I can find the time to drink and smoke
Took 15 hits 'till I can barely walk
I threw up on the lawn, I can't find my phone
I got no guts to tell the one I love
That she's the reason that I wrote this song
And that's some coward shit, I know it's sus
But Lauren call me when you hear this song

[Chorus]
I'm just so sick of being human
I'm just so sick of being human
I'm just so sick of being human
I'm just so sick of being...

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na-na, oh, nay
Nan, nan, nan, nan
Ooh, ah-ah, aye

[Bridge]
See I got GPS on my phone
And I can follow it to get home
If my location's never unknown
Then tell me why I still feel lost
Tell me why I still feel lost

[Outro]
Tell me why I still feel
Tell me why I still feel
Tell me why I still feel human
Tell me why I still feel
Tell me why I still feel
(Human, human, human, human)
