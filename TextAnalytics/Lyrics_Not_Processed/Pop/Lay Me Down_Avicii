[Intro]
Lay-lay, lay me, lay-lay, lay me
Lay-lay, lay me, lay-lay, lay me down
Lay-lay, lay me, lay-lay, lay me
Lay-lay, lay me, lay-lay, lay me down
Lay-lay, lay me, lay-lay, lay me
Lay-lay, lay me, lay-lay, lay me down

[Verse 1]
I believe, things get tough
Sometimes my knees can barely hold me up, yeah
I'm no fool, but it's said
You gotta walk a mile to get outta my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life! Give a damn!
You gotta make a move to show 'em where we can stand, yeah

[Chorus]
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need (Come on)
Lay me down in darkness (Yeah)
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need (Come on)

[Refrain 1]
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need

[Drop]

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain 2]
I got the time, it'll be all right, yeah
I got the time that you need, yeah

[Verse 2]
We all weep, bleed the same
If you get the picture, leave it out of the frame, yeah
In the now, take a chance
Make a mess, and don't forget that life is a dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life! Give a damn!
You gotta make a move to show 'em where we can stand, yeah

[Chorus]
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need (Come on)
Lay me down in darkness (Yeah)
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need, need

[Drop]

[Refrain 1]
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need, yeah
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need

[Refrain 2]
Ooh babe, show me baby, baby tell me that's me, yeah
I got the time, it'll be all right, yeah
I got the time that you need, yeah
Come on!

[Drop]

[Outro]
Lay-lay, lay me, lay-lay, lay me down
Lay-lay, lay me, lay-lay, lay me down
Lay-lay, lay me, lay-lay, lay me down
Lay-lay, lay me, lay-lay, lay me down
Lay-lay, lay me down
In darkness
