Cold looking woman
Like a switch-blade knife
Baby says "I'm gonna break the law tonight"
Ooh, if your daddy could see you now
Rock and roll rebel on a jailbreak run
Big operator, but a little high-strung
There's one in every crowd

You got it comin' to ya
It happens every time
That's what you get for a life of crime
You got it coming to you
If you cross that line
And you can't back up
When the going gets tough
And if the fire's that hot
You better kiss the girl goodbye

Slow down sister
You're burn, burn, burnin'
At the speed of light
You better slow down sister
Put on the brakes
Won't get thru the night

Machine gun love
Gonna shoot to thrill
I'm tellin' you that little girl's kiss could kill
She got me stranded on a one-way street
Can't break the chains
The ties that bind
Slayin' to the rhythm
And my heart's in time
Be where the taste is bittersweet

You got it comin' to ya
It happens every time
That's what you get for a life of crime
You got it coming to you
If you cross that line
When the lights roll down
And you hit the ground
It'll happen so fast
You'll never even have a chance

Slow down sister
I say look out now
Danger in the little girl's eyes
Slow down sister
Well you're gonna find out
Trouble in paradise
That ain't nice

You're a non-stop party
You're a butterfly ball
Twice around the block
You're thinking you done it all
Come on now baby
You know it's true
You want all the money
And the price of fame
Ride to glory
On another man's name
Now there's a lesson here for you

You got it comin' to ya
It happens every time
That's what you get for a life of crime
You got it coming to you
When you cross that line
And you can't back up
When it gets real rough
If the fire's that hot
You better kiss the girl goodbye

Slow down sister
Burn, burn, burnin'
At the speed of light
Slow down sister
Put on the brakes
Now we're gettin' thru the night

You better slow down sister
I said "Look out now"
There's danger
In the little girl's eyes
Slow down sister
Slow down, slow down
Gonna find out there's trouble
Trouble in paradise

I said, slow!
