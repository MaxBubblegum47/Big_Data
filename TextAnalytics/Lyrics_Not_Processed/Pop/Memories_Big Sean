[Verse 1]
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go head and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it then real life’d it!
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch? I’m moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Muthafuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’mma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cuz honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Hook]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

[Verse 2]
Are you willing to give up what you love for who you love
Or lose your girlfriend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set til' you considered great?
How many missed calls til' you considered fake?
How many dreams before its considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cuz they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes, you don’t know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say “in memory”
I’m praying that he make it, wishin' we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories…

[Hook]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

[Verse 3]
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh
I’m stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can’t purchase
Houses bigger than a palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I’m focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles
I’m marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
Man, I’m huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner’s circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan’
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal $20 bill right out her purses
No I ain’t perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die, of course I have the memories..

[Hook]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
