[Chorus]
All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just the beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart

[Verse 1]
No use in holding other hands
For I'd be holding only emptiness
No use in kissing other lips
For I'd be thinking just of your caress

[Chorus]
All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just the beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart

[Verse 2]
No other voice can say the words
My heart must hear to ever sing again
The words you used to whisper low
No other love can ever bring again

[Chorus]
All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just the beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart
