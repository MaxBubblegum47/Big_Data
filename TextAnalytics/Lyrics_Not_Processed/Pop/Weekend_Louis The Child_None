[Verse 1]
Last night, too turnt
No water, ripped shirt
IPhone screen cracked
Did I pay the bar tab?
Can't remember anything
Did I have a good time?
Calling all my new girls
Use a couple of new lines

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
All I got is some blurred-up memories
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
Damn

[Chorus]
Cellphone prepaid was deleted
Got work to do tomorrow
I'm not sleeping
Treating weekdays like the weekend
We've been treating weekdays like the weekend
Pop a couple bottles for no reason
Brand new high heels
I'm not sleeping
Treating weekdays like the weekend
We've been treating weekdays like the weekend
Hey, huh
Hey
We've been treating weekdays like the weekend
Hey, huh
Hey
We've been treating weekdays like the weekend

[Verse 2]
One night, two cups
Three drinks, no fucks
Didnâ€™t cost, so what?
Did it all for us
Can't remember anything
Did I have a good time?
Calling all my ex boys
Using all my old lines

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
All I got is some blurred-up memories
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
Damn

[Chorus]
Cellphone prepaid, was deleted
Got work to do tomorrow
I'm not sleeping
Treating weekdays like the weekend
We've been treating weekdays like the weekend
Pop a couple bottles for no reason
Brand new high heels
Imma sleep in
Treating weekdays like the weekend
We've been treating weekdays like the weekend
Hey, huh
Hey
We've been treating weekdays like the weekend
Hey, huh
Hey
We've been treating weekdays like the weekend

[Chorus]
Cellphone prepaid was deleted
Got work to do tomorrow
I'm not sleeping
Treating weekdays like the weekend
We've been treating weekdays like the weekend
Pop a couple bottles for no reason
Brand new high heels
I'm not sleeping
Treating weekdays like the weekend
We've been treating weekdays like the weekend
