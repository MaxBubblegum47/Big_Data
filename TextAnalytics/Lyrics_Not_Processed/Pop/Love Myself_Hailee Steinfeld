[Intro]
Hey!
Yeah
Hey!

[Verse 1]
When I get chills at night, I feel it deep inside
Without you, yeah (Hey!)
Know how to satisfy, keepin' that tempo right
Without you, yeah (Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures in my mind on replay
I'm gonna touch the pain away  (Hey!)
I know how to scream my own name
Scream my name

[Chorus]
(I love me!)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(Hey!)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(I love me!)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime, day or night
(I love me!)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(Hey!)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(I love me!)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime that I like
(I love me!)

[Verse 2]
I take it nice and slow, feeling good on my own
Without you, yeah (Hey!)
Got me speaking in tongues, the beautiful it comes
Without you, yeah (Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna put my body first
And love me so hard 'til it hurts (Hey!)
I know how to scream out the words
Scream the words

[Chorus]
(I love me!)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(Hey!)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(I love me!)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime, day or night
(I love me!)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(Hey!)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(I love me!)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime that I like
(I love me!)

[Post-Chorus]
Ah la la la, ah la la la la-ah (Hey!)
Ah la la la, ah la la la la-ah (I love me!)

Yeah, I know how to scream my own name
Scream my name
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh!

[Chorus]

Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(Hey!)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(I love me!)
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Anytime, day or night
(I love me!)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(Hey!)
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else
(Don't need nobody else)
(Hey!)
