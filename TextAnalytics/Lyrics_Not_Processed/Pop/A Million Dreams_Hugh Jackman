[Verse 1: Young P.T./Ellis Rubin]
I close my eyes and I can see
A world that's waiting up for me
That I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home

[Pre-Chorus: Young P.T./Ellis Rubin]
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

[Chorus: Young P.T./Ellis Rubin]
'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Our million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Verse 2: Young P.T./Ellis Rubin]
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled
With things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile
On a rainy day

[Pre-Chorus: Young P.T./Ellis Rubin]
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Runaway to a world that we design

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum/Hugh Jackman]
Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Our million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Bridge: Charity Barnum & P.T. Barnum]
However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
You may be right, you may be wrong
But say that you'll bring me along
To the world you see
To the world I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see

[Chorus: Charity Barnum & P.T. Barnum]
'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
A million dreams, a million dreams
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Outro: Charity Barnum & P.T. Barnum]
For the world we're gonna make
