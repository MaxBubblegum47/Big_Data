Mmh
Had to tell the world, you know what I'm sayin', you ain't really fuckin' with me
You know what I'm sayin', you a fan, bitch
Ayy, of all these, man, I'm dolo, thug life
Uh, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
And I don't want no more love, I feel it's poison
Late at night I can't sleep 'cause I hear voices
Tellin' me I'm too deep, quit tryna force it (Uh, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Got too much stuck on my chest, can't get it off of me
I put my demons to rest but they been stalking me
Lord knows I tried my best, I gave it all of me (Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)

[Verse]
Late at night, I been roaming, I ain't getting no sleep (Woah)
It's hard to stay focused when that pain running deep
Been alone my whole life, but you helped me forget
Then you made me remember my heart cold as December
Learning to love myself, I been alone every weekend
They say he's out of breath 'cause he's been runnin' from demons
You left, I needed help, you were someone that I believed in
People change like the seasons, I'm asking what's the reason?
Then I been thuggin' dolo, lay in my bed and cut off my phone
I smoke that dope alone, me and others don't get along
You can peep the pain in my face but I hide it deep in these songs
I learned to keep my mouth closed 'cause don't nobody know what's wrong
Got me addicted to love, and then you left 'round the same time
Sorry I can't make time, been living on space time
I heard through the grapevine she told you we FaceTimed
That shit got a block, tell that bitch to kick rocks, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't want no more love, I feel it's poison
Late at night I can't sleep 'cause I hear voices
Tellin' me I'm too deep, quit tryna force it (Uh, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Got too much stuck on my chest, can't get it off of me
I put my demons to rest but they been stalking me
Lord knows I tried my best, I gave it all of me (Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
And I don't want no more love, I feel it's poison
Late at night I can't sleep 'cause I hear voices
Tellin' me I'm too deep, quit tryna force it (Uh, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Got too much stuck on my chest, can't get it off of me
I put my demons to rest but they been stalking me
Lord knows I tried my best, I gave it all of me (Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah, dawg, woah
Yeah, dawg
Uh, yeah-yeah-yeah, uh
(Dolo, lay in my bed and cut off my phone
I smoke that dope alone, me and others don't get along)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
