[
Verse 1
]
Last night I came around from ten till four
To hear the same excuse again
We argued barefoot on the kitchen floor
It was such a rush
But enough’s enough

[
Chorus
]
Baby let’s slow down
We’re not thinking clearly
Moving too fast to see
I will love you better than you know
I will love you better
I will love you better
Slow down
We’re running on empty
Getting harder to see
That I will love you better than you know
I will love you better
I will love you better

[
Post-Chorus
]
I will love you better than you know
I will love you better than you know

[
Verse 2
]
Why does it feel like we’ve been here before?
Like running circles in the dark
Just know I’m ready to walk out your door
It was such a rush
But enough’s enough

[
Chorus
]
Baby let’s slow down
We’re not thinking clearly
Moving too fast to see
I will love you better than you know
I will love you better
I will love you better
Slow down
We’re running on empty
Getting harder to see
That I will love you better than you know
I will love you better
I will love you better

[
Post-Chorus
]
I will love you better than you know
I will love you better than you know
I will love you better than you know
I will love you better than you know

[
Bridge
]
It feels like we’re doing this wrong
I can’t help thinking that we’re too far gone
It feels like we’re doing this wrong
I can’t help thinking that we’re too far gone
(I will love you better than you know)

[
Chorus
]
Baby let’s slow down
We’re not thinking clearly
Moving too fast to see
I will love you better than you know
I will love you better
I will love you better
Slow down
We’re running on empty
Getting harder to see
That I will love you better than you know
I will love you better
I will love you better

[
Post-Chorus
]
I will love you better than you know
I will love you better than you know
