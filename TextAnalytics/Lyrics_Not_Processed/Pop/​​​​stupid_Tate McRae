[Verse 1]
Only think about him on the weekdays and weekends
Only in the mornings and evenings
Only when I wake up and sleep in
Oh my God
Should have read the warning on the label, I don't
Said, "Proceed with caution," but I won't
Guess I do it often, I know I'm already gone (I'm already gone)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's sad but true
I'd go to Hell and back if I could go there with you
What do I do?

[Chorus]
Oh my God, I'm a fool
Keep on coming back to you
I'm so stupid for ya
I'm so stupid for ya
You're so bad for my health
But I just can't help myself
I'm so stupid for ya
I'm so stupid for ya

[Verse 2]
Have a list of all my habits, habits
Wish I didn't have it so bad, it's
'Cause all of them are you and
The bad things that you do
Ooh, I wonder how you do it
Make me feel stupid
Try to fight it off, but it's useless
I'm so foolish, fooling around with you (Fooling around with you)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's sad but true
I'd go to Hell and back if I could go there with you
What do I do?

[Chorus]
Oh my God, I'm a fool
Keep on coming back to you
I'm so stupid for ya
I'm so stupid for ya
You're so bad for my health
But I just can't help myself
I'm so stupid for ya (I'm so stupid for you)
I'm so stupid for ya

[Bridge]
I'm so stupid for you
For you, for you (I'm so stupid for you)
I'm so stupid for you
For you, for you (Mm)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's sad but true
I'd go to Hell and back if I could go there with you
What do I do?

[Chorus]
Oh my God, I'm a fool
Keep on coming back to you
I'm so stupid for ya
I'm so stupid for ya (I'm so stupid for you)
You're so bad for my health
But I just can't help myself (Just can't help myself)
I'm so stupid for ya
I'm so stupid for ya (I'm so stupid for you)

[Outro]
I'm so stupid for you
For you, for you
I'm so stupid for you
For you, for you (For you)
