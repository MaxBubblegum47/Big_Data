[Verse]
Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than l can?
There's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, l bet she's around

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it's stupid
I just gotta see it for myself
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, oh
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh
I've given my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, oh
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own
