[PIRAGUA GUY]
Sigue andando el camino por toda su vida
Respira...

[NINA]
Breathe

[COMMUNITY]
Y si pierdes mis huellas que dios te bendiga
Respira

[NINA]
This is my street
I smile at the faces
I’ve known all my life
They regard me with pride
And everyone’s sweet
They say, “You’re going places!’
So how can I say that while I was away
I had so much to hide!
“Hey guys, it’s me!
The biggest disappointment you know.”
The kid couldn’t hack it
She’s back and she’s walkin’ real slow
Welcome home
Just breathe...

[NINA]
Just breathe—

[COMMUNITY]
Sigue andando el camino por toda su vida
Respira—
Y si pierdes mis huellas que dios te bendiga
Respira—

[NINA]
As the radio plays old forgotten boleros
I think of the days when this city was mine
I remember the praise

[NINA]
“Ay, te adoro, te quiero,”
The neighborhood waved, and
Said, “Nina, be brave and
You’re gonna be fine!”
And maybe it’s me
But it all seems like lifetimes ago

[COMMUNITY]
Te adoro
Te quiero
Respira!
Respira!

[NINA]
So what do I say to these faces that I used to know?
“Hey, I’m home?”

[NEIGHBOR LADY]
Mira Nina

[NINA]
Hey…

[COMMUNITY]
No me preocupo por ella

[NINA]
They’re not worried about me

[COMMUNITY]
Mira, allí esta nuestra estrella!

[NINA]
They are all counting on me to succeed

[COMMUNITY]
Ella sí da la talla!

[NINA]
I am the one who made it out!
The one who always made the grade
But maybe I should have just stayed home…
When I was a child I stayed wide awake
Climbed to the highest place
On every fire escape
Restless to climb
I got every scholarship
Saved every dollar
The first to go to college
How do I tell them why
I’m coming back home?
With my eyes on the horizon

[COMMUNITY]
Ah! Ah, aah…
Mira Nina
Respira…
Respira…
Ah!

[NINA]
Just me and the 
GWB
, asking, 
“Gee Nina, what’ll you be?"
Straighten the spine
Smile for the neighbors
Everything’s fine
Everything’s cool
The standard reply:
“
Lots of tests, lots of papers.
”
Smile, wave goodbye
And pray to the sky, 
oh, god…
And what will my parents say?

[COMMUNITY]
Nina…

[NINA]
Can I go in there and say

[COMMUNITY]
Nina…

[NINA]
“I know that I’m letting you down…”

[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
Nina…

[NINA]
Just breathe...
