Kill 'em, get 'em, get 'em, oh
Oh (I'm tryna fuckin' get 'em), oh (I'm tryna fuck on a thot)
Oh, oh (Get 'em), oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
What do you want? Won't tell you twice, yeah
I'm a thief in the night (Thief in the night), oh

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
I did some wrong (Oh, oh), but I'm always right (Oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (Oh, oh) and I know how to fight
Boy, I'll tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night (Look)

[Verse 1: Pop Smoke]
If I call you bae, you bae for the day
Or a bae for the night, you not my wife
She want a killer to fuck all night
I wanna fuck on a thot, gimme head all night
AP, big rocks, in the hood with the 'rillas
Five K on the dinner, bring three hundred thou' to the dealer

[Chorus: Pop Smoke & 
Lil Baby
]
I did some wrong (Oh, oh), but I'm always right (Oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (Oh, oh) and I know how to fight
Boy, I'll tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night (
Baby
)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'm rich but I'm ridin', I'm low on exotic, I'm 'bout to fly out and go get me some
Nothin' ain't seen, all this money on me, hunnid racks in the bag, that's a honey bun
Baby OG, I been runnin' these streets, got the game from Lashawn, I'm my mama's son
Learned 'bout the triple cross when I was young and I know I ain't goin' so I keep a gun
I flew to Paris just to buy some Dior
She beggin' for attention, I don't see her
C.I.P. Pop, I wish that you could see us
Million cash plus whenever I go re-up
I got some niggas in the street, won't beat me
I got the industry tryna be me
I just go Ray Charles, they can't see me
I'm in a Rolls-Royce with a RiRi

[Chorus: Pop Smoke & 
DaBaby
]
I did some wrong (Oh, oh), but I'm always right (Oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (Oh, oh) and I know how to fight
Boy, I'll tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night (
Yeah
)

[Verse 3: DaBaby & 
Pop Smoke
]
Like a thief in the night (Thief)
I pull up, give her D for the night (Uh-huh)
Tryna fuck in the V, it's aight (Let's fuck)
We can't fuck up my seats 'cause they white (That's my seats, watch my motherfuckin' seats)
I'm livin' like "Thriller," I only come out at the night time
She don't fuck with liquor, don't like bein' tipsy
She don't do the Henny, just white wine (What she do?)
Pop the cork on some new Pinot Grigio (Yeah)
I pull up in the Porsche wit' a freaky ho (Zoom)
Park the Porsche then pull up in a Lambo (Hmph)
I hop out, Major Payne, rockin' camo (Yessir)
Think she cute, make her fuck, let her man go (She cute)
Like to shoot, light you up, bitch, I'm Rambo
Cuban link full of rocks, it's a choker (
Oh
)
Rest in peace to the Pop, make me smoke ya

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
I did some wrong (Oh, oh), but I'm always right (Oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (Oh, oh) and I know how to fight
Boy, I'll tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night
