[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh, yeah, I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I wanna hold your hand

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh, please, say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please, say to me
You'll let me hold your hand

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Now let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

[Post-Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that, my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Yeah, you
Got that something
I think you'll understand
When I'll
Say that something
I want to hold your hand

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

[Post-Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that, my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Yeah, you
Got that something
I think you'll understand
When I'll
Feel that something
I wanna hold your hand

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
