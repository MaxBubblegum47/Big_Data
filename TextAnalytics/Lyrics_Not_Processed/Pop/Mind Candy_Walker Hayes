[Verse 1]
Don’t know what your perfume was called
But sometimes when I’m walking through the mall
I get a little hit of whatever it was
And I take a little trip back to two-thousand and us
Learnin’ whatcha learn behind the gym
I can see you bite your lip again and again
Like It’s 3:08 on a Tuesday afternoon in Mobile
22 minutes left to kiss till I gotta get to the football field (damn)
Just like that Willie song
Girl, you’re always on my...

[Chorus]
Mind candy, sideline candy
Pretty post game dose with a lime candy
Little piece of why school was high
Make a pop rock, wanna be my
Valentine candy, sublime candy
Back seat back in time candy
Can’t help but smile like I stole it
Every breath you took baby I still hold it
17 years new in that used Blazer
All that yesterlove I savor
Baby, you’re my go to flavor
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
I said Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my

[Verse 2]
Felt like a king with my Mardi Gras date
Up on my shoulders at all of the parades
My queen, you made it rain beads on the square
And all the guys stood behind us watchin’ your fineness up there
And I didn’t even care

[Chorus]
Mind candy, sideline candy
Pretty post game dose with a lime candy
Little piece of why school was high
Make a tic tac, wanna be my
Valentine candy, sublime candy
Back seat back in time candy
Can’t help but smile like I stole it
Every breath you took baby I still hold it
17 years young in that theater
Whisperin’ “we’ll just rent it later"
Baby, you’re my go to flavor
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
I said Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my

[Bridge]
My train of thought derails
Down that rain rinsed azalea trail
Past your waistband elastic when our rock wasn’t classic yet
I can almost kiss your neck
Taste you on my breath
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my

[Chorus]
Mind candy, sideline candy
Pretty post game dose with a lime candy
Little piece of why school was high
Make a pop rock, wanna be
Valentine candy, sublime candy
Back seat back in time candy
Can’t help but smile like I stole it
Every breath you took baby I still hold it
17 years new in that used Blazer
All that yesterlove I savor
Baby, you’re my go to flavor
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
I said Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
