[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
Even though we both know we're liars
And we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party
'Cause we both hate everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding & Swae Lee]
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me (Woo)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
You can never come too close for comfort
I had to cut my bitch off, she bein' stubborn (Stubborn)
I make it known I fuck with you, not undercover ('Cover)
And when I jump in, I'm burnin' rubber (Yeah, skrrt)
Iced out body, didn't go to college (Yeah, yeah)
Price tag poppin', then you on a private (Then you on a)
Don't say "sorry," everyone's watchin' (Everyone)
When you're where I am, everything's timeless (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding & Swae Lee]
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me (Yee)
Close to me

[Break: Ellie Goulding & Swae Lee]
Close to me (Woo)
Yeah

[Bridge: Ellie Goulding]
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding & Swae Lee]
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body (Yeah)
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
Because I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
Close to me

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
(To me)
Close to me
