[Intro]
Um, dois, trÃªs, quatro
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Life's like this
Uh-huh, uh-huh
That's the way it is

[Verse 1: Sangerine]
Chill out, whatcha yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you will see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one-on-one
But you become

[Pre-Chorus: Sangerine e Luba]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back, like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me...

[Chorus: Sangerine e Luba]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

[Verse 2: Sangerine]
You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you aren't where it's at, you see
You're makin' me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not foolin' anyone
When you become

[Pre-Chorus: Sangerine e Luba]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back, like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me...

[Chorus: Sangerine e Luba]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no (No!!)
No, no, no (No!!)
No, no, no (No!!)
No, no, no

[Bridge: Sangerine]
Chill out, what you yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you will see

[Pre-Chorus: Sangerine]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back, like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me...

[Chorus: Sangerine e Luba]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
