[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning
Get into bed
Closing my eyes
I rest my head
There is no arrangement
No time no place
It's gone in the wind
And left no trace

[Chorus 1]
Who can say
Maybe or whatever
It's up to you
You know you can
Trust me
I'll make it up to you

[Verse 2]
You move with the action
You loosen my strings
Your fingers
Can smooth out my jangles
And all those things

[Chorus 2]
Grease on the handle
And the tangles
In my hair
They always seem
To go together
I don't care

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
