[Verse 1]
I know you're hurt, I know it's my fault
But I've kept "I'm sorry" locked in a vault
I know that time just keeps going on
And words by themselves can't right all the wrongs
In a world that's gone crazy, you don't know what's true
Most people don't change, but some people do

[Chorus]
Some people quit drinking too much
And some people quit lying
Some people decide to grow up
But it's never good timing
Most wouldn't forgive what I put you through
But I'm here tonight, hoping some people do

[Verse 2]
Some people say sorry to hear it's okay
But I know it's not so you don't have to say
That you understand 'cause I know you don't
And neither do I, that don't mean that I won't
Try everyday to show you the truth
Most people don't change, but some people do

[Chorus]
Some people quit drinking too much
And some people quit lying
Some people decide to grow up
But it's never good timing
Most wouldn't forgive what I put you through
But I'm here tonight, hoping some people do

[Bridge]
So whether you kiss me or you close the door
Just know that I'm better than I was before

[Chorus]
Some people quit drinking too much
And some people quit lying
Some people decide to grow up
But it's never good timing
Most wouldn't forgive what I put you through
But I'm here tonight, hoping some people do
I'm hoping some people do
