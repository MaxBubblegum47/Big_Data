[Intro]
Magic moments
When two hearts are caring
Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing

[Verse 1]
I'll never forget the moment
We kissed the night of the hayride
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm
While taking a sleigh ride

[Chorus]
Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing
Magic moments
When two hearts are caring
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

[Verse 2]
The telephone call
That tied up the line for hours and hours
The Saturday dance I got up the nerve
To send you some flowers

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The way that we cheered
Whenever our team was scoring a touch down
The time that the floor fell out of my car
When I put the clutch down

[Verse 4]
The penny arcade, the games that we played
The fun and the prizes
The Halloween hop when everyone came
In funny disguises
Magic moments
Filled with love
