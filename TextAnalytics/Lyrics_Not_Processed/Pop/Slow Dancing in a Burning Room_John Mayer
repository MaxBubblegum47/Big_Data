[Verse 1]
It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dying breath of
This love that we've been working on
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's going to come and save you
We pulled too many false alarms

[Chorus]
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

[Verse 2]
I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch, because you can
You try to hit me, just to hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understand

[Chorus]
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

[Bridge]
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?

[Chorus]
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room

[Outro]
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
