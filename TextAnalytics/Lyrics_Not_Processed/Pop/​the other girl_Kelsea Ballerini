[Verse 1: Kelsea Ballerini]
I bet you're from out west somewhere
Hazel eyes and dark brown hair
And everything you wear fits you just right
I bet you drink martinis dry
And never let 'em see you cry
I bet you're more promiscuous than I

[Pre-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Halsey]
I bet you're bold, I bet that's why you seem to occupy his mind
I bet you're smart, but do you know about me? (Is it you?)

[Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini]
Is it me? Is it you?
Tell me who, who's the other girl?
Who's the first? Who's the fool?
Who's the diamond? Who's the pearl?
Are you mad? Me too
And I wonder, in his world
Is it me? Is it you?
Who's the other girl?

[Post-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Halsey, Kelsea Ballerini & Halsey]
Who's gonna put on the red dress
Scarlet letter on her chest
Can't love with this on her conscience
Tell me, who's the other girl, girl, girl, girl?

[Verse 2: Halsey & Kelsea Ballerini]
Are you the one he's talkin' to
When he gets up and leaves the room
And comes back with a distance in his eyes? (Ah)
Maybe I should be the one to leave
But damn, when he starts lovin' me
It makes me think I'm all that's on his mind (Ah, ah)

[Chorus: Halsey]
Is it me? Is it you?
Tell me who, who's the other girl?
Who's the first? Who's the fool?
Who's the diamond? Who's the pearl?
Are you mad? Me too
And I wonder, in his world
Is it me? Is it you?
Who's the other girl?

[Post-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Halsey, Kelsea Ballerini & Halsey]
Who's gonna put on the red dress
Scarlet letter on her chest
Can't love with this on her conscience
Tell me, who's the other girl, girl, girl, girl?

[Bridge: Halsey & Kelsea Ballerini]
I bet you're cool, I bet that's why you seem to occupy his time
I bet by now, you know about me (And you know about me)

[Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Halsey, Kelsea Ballerini, Halsey]
Is it me? (Is it me?) Is it you? (Is it you?)
Tell me who, who's the other girl?
Who's the first? (Who's the first?) Who's the fool? (Who's the fool? Yeah)
Who's the diamond? Who's the pearl?
Are you mad? (Are you mad?) Me too (Me too)
And I wonder, in his world
Is it me? (Is it me?) Is it you? (Is it you?)
Who's the other girl?

[Post-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Halsey, Kelsea Ballerini & Halsey]
Who's gonna put on the red dress
Scarlet letter on her chest
Can't love with this on her conscience
Tell me, who's the other girl, girl, girl, girl?
