[Verse 1: Perrie Edwards]
Hol' up, no, you didn't bow, bow
I ain't the chick to walk behind you around town
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Jesy Nelson, 
Jade Thirlwall
 & 
Perrie Edwards
]
I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it (
Uh-huh
)
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby

[Chorus: Jade Thirlwall]
You're the man, but I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain, but I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, as long as you don't forget

[Post-Chorus]
Who got the power?
I got the—, I got the power
I got the—, I got the power
I got the—, I got the power
Hold up!

[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson]
My turn, I make this look easy, tick tick, boom, like gasoline-y
Yeah, they call me Lamborghini, 'cause I know just what I'm worth
Z-z-z-zero to a hundred, b-b-body make' em stutter
Start my engine, push the button, 'cause I'm gon' be coming first (Ow)

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne Pinnock & 
Jade Thirlwall
]
I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it (
Uh-huh
)
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby

[Chorus: Leigh-Anne Pinnock 
with Jade Thirlwall
]
You're the man, but I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain, but I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, as long as you don't 
forget, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Who got the power?
I got the—, I got the power
I got the—, I got the power
I got the—, I got the power
I got the—
Who got the power?
I got the—, I got the power
I got the—, I got the power
I got the—, I got the power
I got the—
Who got the power?

[Bridge: Leigh-Anne Pinnock, 
Jade Thirlwall
 & 
Perrie Edwards
]
Don't be fooled, I got you wrapped up
In the arms of an animal
Got you thinking that I'm all innocent
But wait 'till I get you home
If you don't, baby, you should know
I'm the one who's in control

[Breakdown: Jesy Nelson]
Motorbike, motorbike, motorbike, motorbike
Bike—, bike—, bike—, bike—
Bike—, bike—, bike—, bike—, bike—, bike—, whoop

[Chorus: All,

Perrie Edwards
 & 
Jesy Nelson

You're the man (
The man, the man

But I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain (
Rain

But I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower (
I'll make it shower
)
You should know, I'm the one who's in control (
I'm in control, now

I'll let you come take the wheel, as long as you don't forget

As long as you don't forget

Take the wheel, you don't forget

Cause I got, I got, I got the power
