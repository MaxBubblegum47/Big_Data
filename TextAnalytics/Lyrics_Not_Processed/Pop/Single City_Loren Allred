Coney Island, City Hall
Sunny Summer, Hazy Fall

Take your pick
I'll have it all
In a single city

Chills appears
Central Park
East and West, I will leave my mark
Pack my bags and I'll embark
On a single city

How you gonna live?
What you gonna do?
Nobody else is looking out for you
Who you gonna call?
What you gonna say?

How you gonna live?
What you gonna do?
Nobody else is looking out for you
Who you gonna call?
What you gonna say?

Happy faces, hungry eyes
Someone smiling, someone cries
And that's what lives while kindness dies
In a single city

No one is around
There's nobody there
Tell me how to live
Tell me how to care
Who you gonna call?
What you gonna say?

No one is around
There's nobody there
Tell me how to live
Tell me how to care
Who gonna call?
What you gonna say?

(Piano interlude)

No one is around
There's nobody there
Tell me how to live
Tell me how to care
Who gonna call?
What you gonna say?

No one is around
There's nobody there
Tell me how to live
Tell me how to care
Who gonna call?
What you gonna say?

Gloomy haze, shining lights
Set the stage for lovely sights
Lively days but lonely nights
It's a single city
