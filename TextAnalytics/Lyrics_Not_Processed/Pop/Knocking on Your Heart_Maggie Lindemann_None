[Verse 1]
Nothing makes it hard to breathe
Like being in your company
When you've got someone new around your arms
I thought I'd be over it
To see you lock with other lips
I guess I'm just no good at moving on

[Pre-Chorus]
I always tried to tell myself
That I'd fall in love with someone else
But oh, my stubborn heart is set on you
And every night I fall asleep
Just so I can see you in my dreams
And now, I think you ought to know the truth

[Chorus]
Are you listening?
I'm knocking on your heart, could you let me in?
Tell me I'm the one, and I've always been
'Cause I don't wanna wonder if we'll over meet again
I'm knocking on your heart, could you let me in?

[Verse 2]
When you left I made you swear
Our love would last, no matter where
And we would call each other every night
But nights turned into weeks
Turned into months we didnâ€™t speak
And so, we lost our sense of love over time

[Pre-Chorus]
I always tried to tell myself
That I'd fall in love with someone else
But oh, my stubborn heart is set on you
And every night I fall asleep
Just so I can see you in my dreams
And now, I think you ought to know the truth

[Chorus]
Are you listening?
I'm knocking on your heart, could you let me in?
Tell me I'm the one, and I've always been
Cause I don't wanna wonder if we'll over meet again
I'm knocking on your heart, could you let me in?
