[Andy Samberg]
(Yeah, oh yeah. You got the look.)

[Hugh Jackman]
Girl - you got the look (you got the look!)
You're rolling up in the party with one titty out (one titty out)
Oh, girl, you got the whole damn way shook up (you really got it shook)
The way your booby be breathing
It makes me wanna scream and shout, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Akiva Schaffer]
Damn, girl - you rockin' that thing (ow!)
With no support, just watching it swing (yeah!)
May be a mistake, but now she just owning it;
"Ay caramba!" titty, girl you Matt Groening it (ooh)

[Andy Samberg]
I like to think you been looking in the mirror (yeah)
Said to yourself "something's not right here; (ooh, yeah)
Time to shake things up!" so you shook one out
Your hair wasn't working, so you took one out;
A titty (ooh)

[Hugh Jackman]
You're rocking one solo titty, and that's your right
Now you're running this city with one sassy titty
All damn night

[Akiva Schaffer]
She got legs and she knows how to use 'em

[Andy Samberg]
Also got one titty out - sounds so confusing!

[Akiva Schaffer]
Proving she knows how to get attention;

[Andy Samberg]
One laid-back titty with no pretention

[Both: Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer]
A strong choice, or just a mistake?
A strong choice, or just a mistake?
Is fashion really what she's all about?
Intentional, or does she even know it's out?

[Jackman]
Squirrel, you're the center of attention
Tell me, is that good or bad?
'Cause if it's not on purpose, it would be really sad
Schmurl, strutting on down the catwalk
What will the people say?
I've seen into the future, and the look is here to stay

[Kristen Wiig]
Now wait a second...
Why's it always gotta be the ladies taking things out?

[Hugh Jackman]
Mmm, whatcha had in mind?

[Kristen Wiig]
Something like this, groove:
Boy, you got the look;
Rolling up in the party with one ball out

[Sounds of disgust from Jackman and TLI]

Oh, yeah, that's gross
Sorry
That is not the same thing
Nobody wants to see that
I was wrong
I'm a jerk, sorry everybody

[Jackman]
I'm humiliated!
