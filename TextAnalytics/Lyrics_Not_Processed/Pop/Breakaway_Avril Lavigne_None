[Verse 1]
Grew up in a small town
And when the snow would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I end up happy
I would pray
(I'm) trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I'd pray
I could break away

[Chorus]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I make a wish, take a chance
Make a change, and break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
Take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and break away

[Interlude]
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da da-da

[Verse 2]
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jetplane
Far away
And break away

[Chorus]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I make a wish, take a chance
Make a change, and break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and break away

[Bridge]
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging with revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But gotta keep movin' on movin' on
Fly away, break away

[Chorus]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and break away
Break away
Break away
