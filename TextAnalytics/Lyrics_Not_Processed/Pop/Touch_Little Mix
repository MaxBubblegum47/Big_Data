[Verse 1: Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
You and I and nobody else
Feeling feelings I've never felt
The way you got me under your spell
Don't you keep it all to yourself

[Pre-Chorus: Perrie Edwards]
So, won't you take it?
I feel like for the first time I am not faking
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing
Master of anticipation, don't you keep it all to yourself

[Chorus: All (Main vocals of Thirlwall and Pinnock)]
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet, all week
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your lo-ove
Just a touch of your lo-ove

[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson & All]
Photograph with no T-shirt on
Why you making me wait so long? (Wait so long?)
I promise to keep this a secret, I'll never tell
But don't you keep it all to yourself, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, no-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Jade Thirlwall]
So, won't you take it?
I feel like for the first time I am not faki-i-i-ng
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing
Master of anticipation, don't you keep it all to yourself, to yourself

[Chorus: All (Main vocals of Thirlwall and Pinnock), Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock & (Jesy Nelson)]
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week (Uh)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch)
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch, just a touch)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch, just a touch)
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week (Knock me off my feet)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Just a touch of your love is enough
(Your love, your love, your love, yeah-ah)
To take control of my whole body (Body)
(Your love, your love, your love, yeah-ah)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Your love, yeah), just a touch of your lo-ove, hey

[Bridge: All, Jade Thirlwall & Perrie Edwards]
And now my whole week, my whole week is golden (Hey, yeah)
Can you see me glowing? That's how I feel (Feel)
And I'm not afraid to fade into emotions (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know that this could be something real (Ooh)

[Chorus: All (Main vocals of Thirlwall and Pinnock), Perrie Edwards, Jade Thirlwall, Jesy Nelson & (Leigh-Anne Pinnock)]
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week (Knock me off my feet)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Hey)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch, your love)
Just a touch of your love is enough (Uh)
To take control of my whole body (Body)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Baby, one touch of your love)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (One touch of yourâ€”!)
(Oh) Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet, all week (Knock me off of my feet, all week)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch)
(Your love, your love, your love, yeah-ah)
Just a touch of your lo-ove (Just a touch, yeah-ah)
(Your love, your love, your love, yeah-ah)
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body (Oh, woah, yeah-ey)
Just a touch of your lo-ove, hey!
Just a touch of your love (Just a touch of your love), oh!
