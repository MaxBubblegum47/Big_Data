[Verse 1]
Don't got yo money
But we're so rich (yeah)
Turn up the music
When life's a bitch (yeah)
We don't own
We don't own
Nothing except the sound of the bass
We don't own
We don't own
Nothing except the sound of the bass

[Chorus]
It don't matter where you come from
It don't matter who you are
You don't got to be famous, baby
For you to be my superstar
It don't matter where you come from
It don't matter who you are
You don't gotta be famous, baby
For you to be my superstar
Tonight you'll be my superstar
Baby you're my superstar

[Verse 2]
Don't got no car
Don't got no home (yeah)
I turn off the TV
To read my phone (yeah)
We don't own
We don't own
Nothing except the sound of the bass
We don't own
We don't own
Nothing except the sound of the bass

[Chorus]
It don't matter where you come from
It don't matter who you are
You don't gotta be famous, baby
For you to be my superstar
Tonight you'll be my superstar
Baby you're my superstar

[Bridge]

[?] the whole world is watching
But it feels like it's just you
(You don't gotta be)
(You don't gotta be)
(You don't gotta be), baby

[Outro]
For you to be my superstar
Tonight you'll be my superstar
Baby you're my superstar
