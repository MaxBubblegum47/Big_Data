[Verse 1]
Shut me out, but pull me close
Kinda loving it, give me your heartache
Hold me tight, but let me go
Kinda loving it, look what you started
Turn me on, then piss me off
Kinda loving it, got me addicted
Oh, you got me addicted

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't mind
What you do, what you do, what you do with me baby
I'm so down
Do whatever you want me to do
When you ask me

[Chorus]
I don't care how many times you breaking my heart
I'm just too weak to stay cool
Guess I'm a sucker for you
And I know it's complicated
But I hate being smart
So all the things that you do
Makes me a sucker for you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Guess I'm a sucker for you
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Guess I'm a sucker for you

[Verse 2]
Making plans, don't show up
Baby I don't mind, keeping me waiting
Every night, you're by my side
I know it's really worth every second

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind
What you do, what you do, what you do with me baby
I'm so down
Do whatever you want to me to do, when you ask me

[Chorus]
I don't care how many times you breaking my heart
I'm just too weak to stay cool
Guess I'm a sucker for you
And I know it's complicated
But I hate being smart
So all the things that you do
Makes me a sucker for you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Guess I'm a sucker for you
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Guess I'm a sucker for you

[Bridge]
I don't wanna let go
I'm not gonna let go
Even if you hurt me baby
So go ahead and hurt me baby
Take me high to low, low
Get me hot and cold, cold
Go ahead and call me crazy
No, I'm not gonna leave you baby

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Guess I'm a sucker for you
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Guess I'm a sucker for you

[Outro]
Guess I'm a, guess I'm a
Guess I'm a sucker for you
Guess I'm a, guess I'm a
Guess I'm a, guess I'm a, guess I'm a
Guess I'm a sucker for you
