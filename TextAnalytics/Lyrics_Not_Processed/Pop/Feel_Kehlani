[Intro: Post Malone]
Yeah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah-eah, yeah-eah, yeah-eah (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-eah (Oh, oh)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
She talkin' that noise, take her lovin' with the dawn
All while I talk on the phone
After we fuck in the morn', she wake up, she wearin' my clothes
She always be callin' my phone
She always be stealin' my clothes, ayy
Askin' me, “How does it feel when you know you could buy out the store?”, ayy
I'm Bathin' Ape down to the floor, ayy
I'm droppin' the four in the foreign, ayy
I came a long way on my own, ayy
I'm doin' this shit on my own, ayy
I don't give a fuck what I'm told, ayy
I came a long way on my own, ayy
Now her pussy made out of gold, ayy
I swear her pussy ownin' my soul
She got that sauce, yeah
Four days a hundred thousand
Forever like a diamond
She bring me back to life, yeah
I'm so fly, I'm martian
Quit talkin' all that nonsense
I'm just tryna fuck you 'til you don't know nothin', oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Kehlani & Post Malone]
I cross my T's and dot my I's, yeah, I'm for real (Yeah, I'm for real)
He hold me down (She hold me down)
That's my shield (That's my shit)
He buy whatever, he know the drill (Know the drill)
Don't need no pill (Don't need no pill, no)
He whispered in my ear and told me feel, feel, feel, oh, oh, oh (Feel, feel, yeah, feel, feel, yeah)

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
He love that I say what I feel, he feel what I say 'cause it's real
You couldn't forget, I never changed up on my set
And I only make calls to collect, that's why we connect
We can go half on a jet, baby, we on to the next, fuck all the stress
Fuckin' with bitches who's new to the game when you got you a vet
I know you like it when I act like I'm still shy
Then turn around and put that thing in overdrive
I'm down to ride, I'ma keep you on my shoulder
'Cause every cold nigga need a bitch that's ten times colder

[Chorus: Kehlani & Post Malone]
I cross my T's and dot my I's, yeah, I'm for real (Yeah, I'm for real)
He hold me down (She hold me down)
That's my shield (That's my shit)
He buy whatever, he know the drill (Know the drill)
Don't need no pill (Don't need no pill, no)
He whispered in my ear and told me feel, feel, feel, oh, oh, oh (Feel, feel, yeah, feel, feel, yeah)

[Outro: Post Malone]
Hey, fuck me 'til I can't see straight
Make me think that ho was a mistake
I just need to feel you all the time
Ride, ho, ride, ho, alright (Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel)
