[Chorus]
Don't take it personal
But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see)

[Verse 1]
I think it's time I lay my heart out on the line
I think it's time to say what's playing on my mind
I see you out with him and I say that I'm fine
Happens every time (Every time)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm sick and tired of playing games
I'm sick and tired of being second place
And I know if I never try
I'll be sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Chorus]
Don't take it personal
But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see)
Girl, don't take it personal
But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see)
Girl, don't take it personal
But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see)
Girl, don't take it personal
But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see, girl)

[Verse 2: Maggie Lindemann]
You know how much I love it when you call me out
You see it in my eyes, the way they follow you around
'Cause yeah, I like the way you dance
You know I do, yeah I do
'Cause that's just you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Maggie Lindemann]
I'm sick and tired of being friends
I'm sick and tired of being there
And I know if I never try
I'll be sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Chorus]
Girl, don't take it personal
But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see)
Girl, don't take it personal
But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see)

[Bridge: Maggie Lindemann & Brad]
So, let's make it personal
Tell me what you like
Let's make it personal
'Cause I know that you want to try to get personal
Tell me what you like
Let's make it personal (Personal)

[Chorus]
So, don't take it personal
But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see)
Don't take it personal
But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see)
Girl, don't take it personal
But personally, I think you'd be better with somebody like me
But worst of all, you don't even see (You don't even see)
