[Verse 1]
I feel like it's been a long while now since you've been gone
Maybe it's cause we had sex, that time it was too damn good
Don't let your panties get too wet, let me take it off for ya'
Who else is gonna be a man to yah?
I know that I'm young, but I'm just bein' honest
You're with me right now, baby let's go further
Cause I'm gonna get you good
You don't fuck with niggas in your hood
Southside nigga and the name is Roy
Ex-girlfriend knows I've been up there
Everybody hear, don't know what it is
I want you to show me yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
Since I'm always here, I'm only gone for a minute
Gone for a minute
Whenever I push to start you, I don't want you to finish
Just keep ridin'
Since I'm always here, I'm only gone for a minute
Gone for a minute
Whenever I push to start you, I don't want you to finish
Just keep ridin'

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gon' get you good
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play
Cause I'm gon' get you good
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play
Cause I'm gon' get you good
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play
Cause I'm gon' get you good
Get you good, get you good, get you good
Cause I'm gon' get you good

[Verse 2]
I can't get enough of you
Shawty show me what's up with you
There's lots of things that I want to do
But tell me what you can do
Cause I know there's things that he didn't show you
Let me be your teacher while up in the bedroom
Make your neck red with my 
goatee
Don't press pause, girl we're on repeat
Lets get high, blow it down, 6 feet
She could love me, well you know me
He can't love you when you're with me
Let me take you down, baby come and give me all
This is me now, forget about who they know
Never had a woman that had showed me love
So I never felt this feeling before
Gon' and give me some,
 
I'm giddy for more

[Pre-Chorus]
Since I'm always here, I'm only gone for a minute
Gone for a minute
When I ride, push to start you, I don't want you to finish
Just keep ridin'
Since I'm always here, I'm only gone for a minute
Gone for a minute
When I ride, push to start you, I don't want you to finish
Just keep ridin'

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gon' get you good
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play
Cause I'm gon' get you good
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play
Cause I'm gon' get you good
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play
Cause I'm gon' get you good
Get you good, get you good, get you good
Cause I'm gon' get you good

[Outro]
Cause I'm gon' get you good
I'm gon' get you good
I'm gon' get you good
Girl I'm gon' get you good
Get you good, get you good
I'm gon' get you good
Get you good, get you good, get you
Girl I'm gon' get you good
