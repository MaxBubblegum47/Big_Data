[Intro: YFN Lucci]
(Think It's A Game?)
Yeah-huh, huh, huh, ayy-yeah
Yeah, yeah, ayy-yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
Yeah, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wonder why the sun don't shine everyday, yeah, yeah
I wonder why, I wonder why
I wonder why some of these niggas be fake, yeah
All you gotta do is have faith
Glad my niggas ain't never lost faith yeah

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
I paid my dues
Nigga don't play, you'll lose
You probably couldn't walk a mile in 'em
Nigga, do you know how much I paid for these shoes?
Yeah, I was raised in the zoo, a nigga never played by the rules
Some niggas tried to play me back in high school, yeah
I fucked around and made the news
I never been a sucker
She sucked me so good that I think I love her
These niggas injured, they gon' need to recover
You can come over but you cannot sleep over
Please bring a friend, I do not eat leftovers
We got that clean, they shit stepped over
Fuck your opinion, I knew I would get it
I promise that hip-hop is not over
See I do not live in no mansion
But I'm 'bout my green like I'm Stanley
See, I am so up, I'ma need a xanny
You gotta be hood just to understand me
My trunk in the hood if you understand me
These niggas ain't good if you understand me
I came from the bottom, I could've got shot up
I still can't believe that I'm still standin', yeah
I got on Cuban links, this is Voltaire, it is a mink
Look like a polar bear huggin' me
Girl get on top and make love to me
Love me forever, don't ever get tired of me
Why the fuck would you lie to me?
If I told you I got you, I got you believe me don't let your faith die on me girl

[Chorus: YFN Lucci & Skooly]
Yeah
I wonder why the sun don't shine everyday, yeah, yeah
I say I wonder why, I say I wonder why, yeah, yeah
I wonder why some of these niggas be fake, yeah
All you gotta do is have faith
Glad my niggas ain't never lost faith, yeah, yeah
None of my niggas ain't never lost faith
I wonder why, look
Another nigga bitch on the drink
Diamonds drippin' on me like a sink
Fuck what another nigga think

[Verse 2: Skooly]
Look, I'm bout to take em to school, huh
Teach 'em to break all the rules, huh
I'm tired of these pussy lil' fools
Them niggas ain't cool, them niggas is fools, they fools
I do not mean to be rude, fuck with me Lucci, huh
See a fuck nigga, shoot a fuck nigga, um, tell me who shootin'
I, come from a side of the hood where the gangsters and killers be coolin' (Westside)
I'm with YFN and all of them niggas be shootin', don't get your shit ruined
Might take a trip to the ruins, my bitches bad and you knew it
My car is sad and it's blue and, look what the money done blew in
Niggas that thinking they foolin' us, there will be funerals for all that snitchin' lil homie
I really be dealin' with bangas, them Nela's, them 60s, the Pirus and Crips, lil homie
How could you trip lil homie?
I am the shit lil homie, Amen
Me and Lucci might get you whacked for a job
Welcome to the mob

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Yeah
I wonder why the sun don't shine everyday, yeah, yeah
I say I wonder why, I say I wonder why, yeah, yeah
I wonder why some of these niggas be fake, yeah
All you gotta do is have faith
Glad my niggas ain't never lost faith, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Skooly]
Glad my niggas ain't never lost faith
I'm glad my niggas ain't never lost faith
That's how is 'posed to be (Haha)
Niggas ain't, niggas ain't
Niggas ain't real as me
Niggas ain't real as me
I'm glad my niggas ain't never lost faith
And that's how is 'posed to be
Niggas ain't real as me
Yeah, yeah
