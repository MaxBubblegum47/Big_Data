[Verse]
Wanna get off my sailboat
I'm tired of waiting
Where is my spaceship?
I'm tired of sailing
Can't see land from where I am
Loneliness hits bam, bam
Trapped in open seas, I've never swam

[Pre-Chorus]
Now there's salt on my tongue
Soon there'll be sand in my lungs
Soon I'll be all out of fun
Soon all my songs will be done

[Chorus]
Run on the water
Wish I could run on the water
Run under the sun on the water
Run from all the guns on the water

[Verse]
Wanna get off my sailboat
I'm tired of waiting
Where is my spaceship?
I'm tired of sailing
Can't see land from where I am
Loneliness hits bam, bam
Trapped in open seas, I've never swam

[Pre-Chorus]
Now there's salt on my tongue
Soon there'll be sand in my lungs
Soon I'll be all out of fun
Soon all my songs will be done

[Chorus]
Run on the water
Wish I could run on the water
Run under the sun on the water
Run from all the guns on the water

[Bridge]
I just, I just saw-
I just, I just saw a bottle
And it looked clean
Could it be? Life is close to me?
I just saw a bottle
A-And it looked clean
Could it be? Could it be?
Life is close to me?
I just saw a bottle
And it looked clean
Could it be? Life is close to me?

[Outro: Spoken]
I just-
I just saw a bottle
This shit is clean
