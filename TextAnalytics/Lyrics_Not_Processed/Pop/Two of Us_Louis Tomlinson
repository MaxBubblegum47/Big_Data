[Verse 1]
It's been a minute since I called you
Just to hear the answerphone
Yeah, I know that you won't get this
But I'll leave a message so I'm not alone
This morning I woke up still dreaming
With memories playing through my head
You'll never know how much I miss you
The day that they took you, I wish it was me instead

[Pre-Chorus]
But you once told me, "Don't give up
You can do it day by day"
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away

[Chorus]
So I will keep you, day and night, here until the day I die
I'll be living one life for the two of us
I will be the best of me, always keep you next to me
I'll be living one life for the two of us
Even when I'm on my own, I know I won't be alone
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song
I know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud
I'll be living one life for the two of us

[Verse 2]
I could feel your blood run through me
You're written in my DNA
Looking back in every memory
I know you'll be waiting, I'll see you again

[Pre-Chorus]
But you once told me, "Don't give up
You can do it day by day"
And diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away (Fade away)

[Chorus]
So I will keep you, day and night, here until the day I die
I'll be living one life for the two of us
I will be the best of me, always keep you next to me
I'll be living one life for the two of us
Even when I'm on my own, I know I won't be alone
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song
I know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud
I'll be living one life for the two of us

[Bridge]
I promised you I'd do this
So all of this is all for you
Oh, I swear to God you're living
Through everything I'll ever do

[Chorus]
So I will keep you, day and night, here until the day I die
I'll be living one life for the two of us
I will be the best of me, always keep you next to me
I'll be living one life for the two of us
Even when I'm on my own, I know I won't be alone
Tattooed on my heart are the words of your favourite song
I know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud
I'll be living one life for the two of us

[Post-Chorus]
One life for the two of us
I'll be living one life for the two of us

[Outro]
We'll end just like we started
Just you and me and no one else
I will hold you where my heart is
One life for the two of us
