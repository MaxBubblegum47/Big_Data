[Verse 1]
I thought I was a dreamer
But it's not a dream
I'm falling so much deeper
Into what is real
My eyes are open and I see it
I'm no longer blind
You lead the way out of this fever
Into a peace of mind

[Chorus]
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
And I know all the pain will be over
When you carry my weight on your shoulder
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
There's a light coming on the horizon
That forever will shine like a diamond
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above

[Verse 2]
Though that I was leaving
But I got stuck between your thighs
A different kind of freedom
I wait for you to shine
I be down in heavy breathing
Wind under your wings
Deeper for you my demon
My queen of everything
And it's slowly flowing through my body can you feel it

[Chorus]
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
And I know all the pain will be over
When you carry my weight on your shoulder
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
There's a light coming on the horizon
That forever will shine like a diamond
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
Fall asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day
Fall asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day

[Chorus]
And I know all the pain will be over
When you carry my weight on your shoulder
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
There's a light coming on the horizon
That forever will shine like a diamond
I want you higher love
Cause there's no sky above
Fell asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day
Fell asleep living, wake up to
To a new day, brand new day
Fell asleep living, wake up to
