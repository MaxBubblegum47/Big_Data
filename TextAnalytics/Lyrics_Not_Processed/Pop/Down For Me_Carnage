[Pre-Chorus: 24hrs]
She got a body like Rihanna
Double rice at Benihana
Uptight, but drive a Honda
She was the only one down for me
She got that ass like her momma
She said she not with the drama
You get her number, better call her

[Chorus: 24hrs & G-Eazy]
She was the only one down for me, whoa, oh, oh
She was the only one down for me
(She was the only one down, yeah
Only one down, only one down)
She was the only one down for me

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Uh, stay loyal and stay down
By my side, every night when I lay down
She would always pick me up when I break down
I knew her secrets, we both from the same town
She had everythin' that I need
But half of my lifestyle was high speed
She wants Netflix and chill and to light weed
She wants marriage and one day, my seed
Uh, but I'm movin' at light speed
And distance is stress, not what I need
FaceTime's, only I see her face on live feed
Worlds apart so it's harder to succeed
Yeah, but true love is true pain
I felt like Bruce Wayne, then bolt like Usain
Had a hard time adjustin' to new fame
My life ain't the same since the day that you came (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: 24hrs & (G-Eazy)]
She got a body like Rihanna (Rihanna)
Double rice at Benihana (damn)
Uptight, but drive a Honda (straight up)
She was the only one down for me (down for me)
She got an ass like her momma (she do)
She said she not with the drama (uh uh)
You get her number, better call her (do that)

[Chorus: 24hrs]
She was the only one down for me, whoa-oa-oa
She was the only one down for me
(She was the only one down
Only one down, only one down)
She was the only one down for me

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, sun comin' up, layin' wide awake
Seein' images of you that I'm tryna shake
Stomach turnin' from mistakes wasn't tryna make
And all the promises that I will break
Yeah, I try to act like there's nothin' wrong
But it seems every week I make another song
About you, my bros are like, "What's goin' on?"
"Quit trippin', bro, you need to be movin' on"
With all due respect, a good bitch
But after we broke up, it seemed her mood switched
Things could be different, I'd never choose this
I text and she answered like, "New phone, who's this?"
Uh, and that's as wild as shit gets
She's not the same person as we was when we met
I'm not the same either, probably change with each step
I take a deep breath and try to reset (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: 24hrs & (G-Eazy)]
She got a body like Rihanna
Double rice at Benihana (damn)
Uptight, but drive a Honda (straight up)
She was the only one down for me (down for me)
She got an ass like her momma (she do)
She said she not with the drama (uh uh)
You get her number, better call her (do that)

[Chorus: 24hrs]
She was the only one down for me, whoa, oh, oh
She was the only one down for me
(She was the only one down
Only one down, only one down)
She was the only one down for me

[Outro: 24hrs]
Only one down
Only one down
Only one
Only one down
Only one down for me
Only one down
Only one down
Only one
Only one down
Only one down
