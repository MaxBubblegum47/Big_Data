[Verse 1]
Should have, could have, would have, but it's too late
Shouldn't catch feelings on a first date
Oh-whoa-ah, oh-whoa-ah
0 to 100, no first base
Ended up with coffee back at your place
Oh-whoa-ah, oh-whoa-ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night, it's keeping me awake
I keep thinking about all the things that I would change

[Chorus]
If we could go back, ah
Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?
If we could turn back, ah
Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?
Go back, go, go back (Hey)
Go back, go, go back (Hey)

[Verse 2]
Tryna win your heart but it's no race
Never had the time to find our own pace
Oh-whoa-ah, oh-whoa-ah
Tryna drown feelings that won't go away
Sleep in the bed of my own mistakes
Oh-whoa-ah, oh-oh-oh-whoa-ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night, it's keeping me awake
I keep thinking about all the things that I would change

[Chorus]
If we could go back, ah
Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?
If we could turn back, ah
Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?
Go back, go, go back (Hey)
Go back, go, go back

[Bridge]
I know time waits for no man
I'm standing here now with no plans
Let's go back, go, go, back (Hey)
I know time waits for no man
I'm standing here now with no plans
Let's go back, go, go back

[Chorus]
If we could go back, ah
Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?
If we could turn back (If we could come back)
Ah (Oh-oh-oh)
Tell me would you even (Yeah, yeah)
Would you still believe in me?
Go back, go, go back (Me, hey)
Tell me would you still believe in me, me? (Go back, go, go back)
(Go back, go, go back)
Tell me would you believe?
(Go back, go, go back)
