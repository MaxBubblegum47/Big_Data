[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
They tell me I should make a plan for a life
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is what to do tonight
Hundred miles an hour, no headlights
On an open road home
We do what we can to dull the pain
Pinky promise things still stay the same
Even when I'm old, I'll know your name
Anywhere we go, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Dye my hair a million colours
Dream I'll make a billion dollars
I swear that day can't come soon enough
In the meantime, we just

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Fall in love, broken heart
Break the rules, drink too much
We're all a mess, but I guess
This is what it feels like to be young (To be young)
Take a punch (Take a punch), get back up (Get back up)
Act a fool (Act a fool), give a fuck (Give a fuck)
We're all a mess (All a mess), but I guess
This is what it feels like to be young

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
Small town and we're drinkin' all the liquor (Yeah)
Every night, tryna feel something bigger (Feel something bigger)
Hotbox in the car in the winter
We don't wanna go home

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
And I'll dye my hair a million colours
Dream I'll make a billion dollars
I swear that day can't come soon enough
In the meantime, we just

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Fall in love (Fall in love), broken heart (Broken heart)
Break the rules (Break the rules), drink too much (Drink too much)
We're all a mess (All a mess), but I guess
This is what it feels like to be young (To be young)
Take a punch (Take a punch), get back up (Get back up)
Act a fool (Hey), give a fuck (Give a fuck)
We're all a mess (All a mess), but I guess
This is what it feels like to be young

[Verse 3: Doja Cat]
This can't be real life, don't even feel high
Maybe if you take one with me, then it'll feel right
Don't wanna know what staying still would even feel like
Wanted to fit in when I didn't, now I know
And I just want freedom, can't be lonely
Heartless, hopeful, stupid, phony
Say they love me, but won't show me
Is this how it feels like to be young?

[Chorus: Doja Cat, Anne-Marie & Both]
Fall in love (Young), broken heart (Young)
Break the rules (Young), drink too much (Young)
We're all a mess (Young), but I guess
This is what it feels like to be young
Take a punch (Take a punch), get back up (Get back up)
Act a fool (Act a fool), give a fuck (Give a fuck)
We're all a mess (All a mess), but I guess
This is what it feels like to be young

[Outro: Anne-Marie]
Yeah-oh-oh-oh
Yeah-oh-oh-oh
This is what it feels like to be young, young
This is what it feels like to be young
