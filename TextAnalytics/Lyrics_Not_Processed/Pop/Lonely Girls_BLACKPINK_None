[Chorus: All]
We are the lonely girls
Lost in the night, losing our minds looking for love
Feel like the only girls
Left all alone, no one to hold, all we got is us

[Post-Chorus: Ros√©]
But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?
