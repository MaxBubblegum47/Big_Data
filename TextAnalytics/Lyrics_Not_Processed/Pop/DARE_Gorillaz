[Intro: Shaun Ryder]
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's dare
It's dare

[Chorus: Noodle & 2D]
You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, there
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out

[Hook: Shaun Ryder]
Never did no harm
Never did no harm
It's dare
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's dare

[Chorus: Noodle, 2D & 
Shaun Ryder
]
You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, there
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out

[Hook: Shaun Ryder]
Never did no harm
Never did no harm
It's dare
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's dare
It's dare

[Chorus: Noodle, 2D & 
Shaun Ryder
]
You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, there
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out

[Chorus: Noodle, 2D & Shaun Ryder]
You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, there
Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out
