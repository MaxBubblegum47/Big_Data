[Verse 1]
Thought I could leave you cause I felt my heart numbing
It hits so deep, I closed my eyes and I just took off running
I turned around and saw the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed

[Verse 2]
But I don’t need you and you should know that, baby
It'd take a miracle for you to really try and change me
And I felt sorry for the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed

[Chorus]
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

[Verse 3]
You wanna leave her, don’t wanna hurt nobody
I don’t believe a single word you say or that you’re sorry
Why can’t I say no to the look on your face?
I just stay, stay

[Chorus]
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

[Bridge]
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay
But will you, will you, will you?

[Chorus]
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

[Outro]
I stay, I stay
Oh why do I stay?
So I stayed, stayed
