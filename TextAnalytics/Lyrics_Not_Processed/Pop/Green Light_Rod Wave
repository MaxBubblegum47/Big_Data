[Intro]
Mmm
(Ayo, Nashi, you go crazy)
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Okay, green light, uh, pistol in the party don't seem right
Lil' bro off that molly, can't think right
It's about to be a fuckin' green light
I get in my feelings off that Hen, dawg
I'm gon' be this way until the end, dawg
I got too much on my mind and I cannot get it off
Gon' be a homicide before Nuni take the loss

[Verse]
The good die young (Green light), they be the first ones to leave
Ace told me keep my strap but now he restin' in peace
If I ever catch the nigga who killed him out on the street
I'ma tie him to my truck and drive that nigga to the beach, brr
Ayy, tell a nigga, "Rest in peace", uh, tryna blind a nigga
Fuck it, jump in the bucket, let's go find these niggas
All I need is a half a ounce of weed, my brand new AR-15
I'm gon' make a nigga bleed

[Pre-Chorus]
Ayy, tell him leave it in the street, we gon' put it in they life
Spin his block with that Glock, he jumped the gate and left his bike
Niggas get knocked out they socks when they get hit with that pipe
Woadie jumped out with that chop, then introduced them to that green light

[Chorus]
Okay, green light, uh, pistol in the party don't seem right
Lil' bro off that molly, can't think right
It's about to be a fuckin' green light
I get in my feelings off that Hen, dawg
I'm gon' be this way until the end, dawg
I got too much on my mind and I cannot get it off
Gon' be a homicide before Nuni take the loss
Green light
