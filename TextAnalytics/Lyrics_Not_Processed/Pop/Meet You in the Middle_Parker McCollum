[Verse 1]
Here that whistle wind and holler
Waking you up in the night
All the way from California
Casanova has arrived
Headline on the morning paper
You read it by the road
Waving goodbye to your neighbor
Where the hell you supposed to go

[Chorus]
Guess I'll meet you in the middle
Well ain't nobody told me it'd be this hard
Guess I'll meet you in the middle
Lord only knows if I'll make it that far

[Verse 2]
Well you told me that you loved me
Then you headed way out west
Chasing dreams that you'd been dreaming
Loving boys you'd never met
And I'm still stuck here
In the city so much left I have to learn
Grandpa's shaking off his cancer
Just in case you hadn't heard

[Chorus]
Guess I'll meet you in the middle
Well ain't nobody told me it'd be this hard
Guess I'll meet you in the middle
Lord only knows if I'll make it that far

[Verse 3]
I can hear the whole town whisper
Barely making out your name
Said you got some fancy hair due
My momma's gone insane
Daddy left no goodbye letter
With no pistol on his grave
In the backyard on the blacktop
Where he left them good old days

[Chorus]
Guess I'll meet you in the middle
Well ain't nobody told me it'd be this hard
Guess I'll meet you in the middle
Lord only knows if I'll make it that far
If I'll make it that far
