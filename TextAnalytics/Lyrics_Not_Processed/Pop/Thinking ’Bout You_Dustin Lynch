[Verse 1: Dustin Lynch]
Well, look who it is
The last call I thought I'd get
How's your mama, how you've been?
Girl, it's been too long
Saw your sister at the Circle K
Heard baby number two was on the way
Hadn't seen her since her weddin' day
With you on my arm

[Pre-Chorus: Dustin Lynch]
It's good to hear from you again
Girl, what a coincidence

[Chorus: Dustin Lynch 
with Lauren Alaina
]
I was just thinkin' 'bout that weekend out on Cumberland Lake
And that one time in Baton Rouge when we made out in the rain
Where we went chasin' fallin' stars on a hill at your daddy's farm
Don't be sorry for callin' me up out of the blue
I was was just thinkin' 'bout you (
Oh
)
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
 (
Mmm
)

[Verse 2: Lauren Alaina]
Hey, I just gotta say
I heard your song the other day
And it put a smile on my face
When I started reminiscing

[Pre-Chorus: Lauren Alaina]
I've been on the edge of callin' you
And I'm so glad I decided to

[Chorus: Dustin Lynch & Lauren Alaina]
I was just thinkin' 'bout that weekend out on Cumberland Lake
And that one time in Baton Rouge when we made out in the rain
Where we went chasin' fallin' stars on a hill at your daddy's farm
Don't be sorry for callin' me up out of the blue
I was was just thinkin' 'bout you
Oh, I was just thinkin' 'bout you

[Bridge: Both, 
Dustin Lynch
 & 
Lauren Alaina
]
If you're ever back in town
Do what you're doin' right now
'Cause I'm probably thinkin' 'bout you
 (
Ooh, woah, oh
)

[Chorus: Dustin Lynch 
with Lauren Alaina
]
I was just thinkin' 'bout that weekend out on 
Cumberland Lake
And that one time in Baton Rouge when we made 
out in the rain
Where we went 
chasin' fallin' stars
 on a hill at 
your daddy's farm
Don't be 
sorry for callin' me up
 out of the blue
I was was just thinkin' 'bout you
Oh, I was just thinkin' 'bout you
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
Oh, 
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
