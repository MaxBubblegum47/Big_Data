[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Ain't nobody gonna tell me shit
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip
And all my friends, they love to call me whipped
But what they just don't know
Is I've looked in New York City
And I've looked in Boston too
I found a couple that are pretty
But I'm still gonna stay with you

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Ain't nobody gonna tell me shit
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip
And all my friends, they love to call me whipped
But what they just don't know
Is I've looked in San Francisco
And I've looked all through L.A
I've looked in Dallas, Texas
But they didn't feel the same
So I looked in Detroit city
Then I checked back at Duke
I found a couple that were pretty
But I'm still gonna stay with you
I'm still gonna stay with

[Outro]
I'm still gonna stay with you
