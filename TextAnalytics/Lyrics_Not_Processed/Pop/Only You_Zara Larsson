[Verse 1]
I don't wanna shower, even if I stink
'Cause I don't wanna wash you off, wash you off my skin
It's been about an hour
And I'm still tremblin', oh
Feelin' you deep, feelin' you deep within
Eh-eh-eh, yeah-eh-eh

[Pre-Chorus]
Opened bottles on the drawer
Rollin' papers on the floor
Eh, don't want a cigarette yet
Don't want no drink on my breath, yes
Wanna taste your taste some more
Feel you pourin' through my pores
Eh, I'm goin' back in my bed to play it back in my head

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't love nobody like I love myself
Like I love myself, only you, ay
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else, only you, only you
Only you

[Verse 2]
I feel you in my fingers, even in my toes
Steam upon the mirror and on the windows
Baby, that was it
Wish it would never end
I just wanna do it, do it again
Eh-eh-eh, yeah-eh-eh

[Pre-Chorus]
I can smell your smell, so sweet
On my pillow, on my sheets
Eh, I wanna keep it like that
Keep on sleepin' like that, yeah
Baby, you'll be hard to beat
What I have is yours to keep
Eh, I never wanted so bad, best that I ever had

[Chorus]
No, I can't love nobody like I love myself
Oh, like I love myself, only you, oh
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else, only you, only you

[Bridge]
Only you
Only you
Only you
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I can't love nobody like I love myself
Like I love myself, only you, only you
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else (Nobody, nobody, nobody)
Only you (No, oh, only you)
