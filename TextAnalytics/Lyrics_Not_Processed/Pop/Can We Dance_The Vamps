[Chorus]
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?

[Verse 1]
Here we go again, another drink I'm caving in
Stupid words keep falling from my mouth
You know that I mean well
My hands were meant for somewhere else
Your eyes are doing naughty butterflies

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, one more drink and I should go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe she might like me though
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I just can't think of what to say
Should I go, should I stay?
Just can't let her slip away

[Chorus]
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?

[Verse 2]
I was nearly in, but then came in the pushy friend
Killed my vibe and took my perfect ten away
You know I need you, girl
My heart's not made for someone else
Take me in cause I can barely stand

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, one more drink and I should go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe she might like me though
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I just can't take this any more
Should I stay? Should I go?
It'll just lead back to her door

[Chorus]
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?

[Bridge]
I've been a bad, bad boy
Whispering rude things in her ear
Please say she'll break
Please say she'll change
Her mind and bring me back to her place

[Chorus]
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?

[Chorus]
I talk a lot of shit when I'm drinking, baby
I'm known to go a little too fast
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy
But they're the only friends that I have
I know I don't know you
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?
