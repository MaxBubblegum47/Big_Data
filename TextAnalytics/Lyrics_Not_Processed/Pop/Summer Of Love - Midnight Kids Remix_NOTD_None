[Verse 1]
I walked you home
The sky was golden
You knew I wouldn't stay
You pulled me close
Beside the ocean
But I turned away

[Chorus]
Oh, why you catching feelings
Under the sun?
Oh, there is only freedom
In the summer of love

[Post-Chorus]
Summer of love
Summer of love
Summer of -
Summer of -
Two hearts, blue stars fallen down
Shoot me up
Summer of love

[Verse 2]
No bleeding nights
We know it's over
A weight lift from the soul
We say goodbye
We're barely sober
With no self control

[Chorus]
Oh, why you catching feelings
Under the sun?
Oh, there is only freedom
In the summer of love

[Post-Chorus]
Summer of love -
Summer of love -
Summer of
Two hearts, blue stars fallen down
Shoot me up
Summer of love

[Bridge]
I've fallen out of your arms
You've fallen out of my heart
I've fallen out of your arms
You've fallen out of my heart

[Post-Chorus]
Summer of love
Summer of love
Summer of -
Two hearts, blue stars fallen down
Shoot me up
Summer of love
