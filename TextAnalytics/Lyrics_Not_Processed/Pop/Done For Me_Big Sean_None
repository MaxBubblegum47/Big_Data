[Intro: Big Sean]
You know I-
You know I made some extra calls for you

[?] through the door for you
You know I take that extra trash out
I bought that ticket then I cashed out
I took you on a vacation
Laying somewhere, I'm just saying shit
What have you done for me baby?
What have you done for me lately uhh
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately uhh
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately?

[Pre Chorus: Big Sean]
Damn, [?] extra texts, and extra calls
And I double time [?] and I know you wanna, shame me too

[?] remember ?
You know I give up on my "Me" time for your free time
In between time
I'm taking extra trips on the way to  [?]
I'm going on camera, to be mine

[Chorus: Big Sean]
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately? uhh
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately? Bring me out
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately? uhh
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately?

[Verse 1: Belly]
I turn a ballerina, to a striper
Gotta kill them hoes now, like the ripper
I'm on the [?]. we on the liquor
When she leave, I swear I feel her in my liver
She got that type of pussy that will make your body shiver
She got that [?] I wonder if she got a sister (Oh my god)
I got her, drip, dripping like a fisher
Pull out my dick so she can she the bigger picture
I kill her pussy, thats a cold case
I got the bottles by the cold case

[?]
I got a pocket full of old friends

[Chorus: Big Sean]
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately? uhh
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately? Bring me out
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately? uhh
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately?

[Refrain]
I kill her pussy, thats a cold case (Cold case)
I get the bottles by the cold case (Cold case)
I kill her pussy, thats a cold case (Cold case)
I get the bottles by the cold case (Cold case)
