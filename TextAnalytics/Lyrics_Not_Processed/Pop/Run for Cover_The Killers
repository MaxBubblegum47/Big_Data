[Verse 1]
What have you gathered to report to your progenitors?
Are your excuses any better than your senator's?
He held a conference and his wife was standing by his side
He did her dirty but no-one died

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I saw Sonny Liston on the street last night
Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song
He motioned me to the sky
I heard heaven and thunder cry

[Chorus]
Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology
It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I saw my mother on the street last night
All pretty and strong, singing 'the road is long'
I said 'Momma I know you've tried'
But she fell on her knees and cried

[Chorus]
Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
I know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

[Bridge]
And there was nothing she wouldn't give
Just to trust him with her nightmares, with her dreams
She's running, she's running
Just to trust him
He got a big smile, he's fake news
Just run for cover, you've got nothing left to lose

[Chorus]
Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover
Run
Run
Run for cover
