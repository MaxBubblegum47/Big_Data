Baby, when we break up from a quarrel or a fight
I can't wait to have you back and hold you, oh, so tight
Tell me why (tell me why) I wanna know (I wanna know)
Tell me why (tell me why) is it so (is it so)
That the best part of breaking up is when you're making up
(Tell me why)
Best part of breaking up is when you're making up
(I wanna know)
But after breaking up be sure you're making up with me
Every time you leave I get those teardrops in my eyes
But they seem to go away when you apologize
Tell me why (tell me why) I wanna know (I wanna know)
Tell me why (tell me why) is it so (is it so)
That the best part of breaking up is when you're making up
(Tell me why)
Best part of breaking up is when you're making up
(I wanna know)
But after breaking up be sure you're making up with me
Come on baby
Come on baby
Don't say maybe
Well it makes no difference who was wrong
Just as long as I'll be with you
Baby I'll be lonely 'til you're back where you should be
'Cause baby I belong to you and you belong to me
Tell me why (tell me why) I wanna know (I wanna know)
Tell me why (tell me why) is it so (is it so)
That the best part of breaking up is when you're making up
(Tell me why)
Best part of breaking up is when you're making up
(I wanna know)
But after breaking up, be sure you're making up with
The best part of breaking up is when you know that you're making up with me
Come on baby
Come home baby
Don't say maybe
Come on baby
Ooh wee baby
Come on baby
Don't say maybe
Come on baby
