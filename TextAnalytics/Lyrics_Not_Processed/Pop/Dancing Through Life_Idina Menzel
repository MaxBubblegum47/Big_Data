[FIYERO]
The trouble with schools is
They always try to teach the wrong lessons
Believe me, I've been kicked out of enough of them to know
They want you to become less callow, less shallow
But I say, why invite stress in?
Stop studying strife
And learn to live the unexamined life
Dancing through life, skimming the surface
Gliding where turf is smooth
Life's more painless for the brainless
Why think too hard when it's so soothing?
Dancing through life, no need to tough it
When you can slough it off as I do
Nothing matters, but knowing nothing matters
It's just life, so keep dancing through
Dancing through life, swaying and sweeping
And always keeping cool
Life is fraught-less when you're thoughtless
Those who don't try never look foolish
Dancing through life, mindless and careless
Make sure you're where less trouble is rife
Woes are fleeting, blows are glancing
When you're dancing through life

[spoken]
So—what's the most swankified place in town?

[GALINDA]
That would be the Ozdust Ballroom

[FIYERO]
Sounds perfect

[sung]
Let's go down to the Ozdust Ballroom
We'll meet there later tonight
We can dance 'til it's light
Find the prettiest girl, give her a whirl
Right on down to the Ozdust Ballroom
Come on, follow me
You'll be happy to be there

[ALL]
Dancing through life down at the Ozdust

[FIYERO]
If only because dust is what we come to

[ALL]
Nothing matters, but knowing nothing matters
It's just life

[FIYERO]
So keep dancing through

[BOQ, spoken]
M-Miss Galinda
I hope you'll save at least one dance for me
I'll be right there waiting, all night

[GALINDA]
Oh, that's so kind
But you know what would be even kinder?

[sung]
See that tragically beautiful girl?
The one in the chair?
It seems so unfair
We should go on a spree and not she
Gee! I know someone would be my hero
If that someone were to go invite her

[BOQ, spoken]
Well, maybe... I could invite her!

[GALINDA, sung]
Oh, 
Biq
, really?
You would do that for me?

[BOQ, spoken]
I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda

[GALINDA, spoken]
So...

[FIYERO, spoken]
So I'll be picking you up around eight?

[GALINDA, spoken]
After all—

[sung]
Now that we've met one another

[FIYERO & GALINDA]
It's clear we deserve each other

[GALINDA]
You're perfect

[FIYERO]
You're perfect

[FIYERO & GALINDA]
So we're perfect together
Born to be forever
Dancing through life

[NESSAROSE]
Oh, Elphaba, isn't it wonderful?
Finally, for this one night
I'm about to have a fun night
With this Munchkin boy Galinda found for me
And I only wish there were
Something I could do for her to repay her
Elphaba, see?
We deserve each other
And Galinda helped it come true
We deserve each other, me and Boq
Please, Elphaba try to understand

[ELPHABA]
I do

[spoken]
Galinda, listen
Nessa and I were talking about you just now

[GALINDA, spoken]
And I was just talking about you!
I thought you might want to wear this hat to the party tonight!

[sung]
It's really, uh, sharp, don't you think?
You know black is this year's pink
You deserve each other, this hat and you
You're both so smart
You deserve each other
So here, out of the goodness of my heart

[BOQ]
Listen, Nessa?

[NESSAROSE, spoken]
Yes?

[BOQ, sung]
Uh, Nessa
I've got something to confess, a
Reason why, well...
Why I asked you here tonight
Now I know it isn't fair

[NESSAROSE]
Oh, Boq, I know why

[BOQ]
You do?

[NESSAROSE]
It's because I'm in this chair
And you felt sorry for me
Well, isn't that right?

[BOQ]
No! No! It's because, uh, because
Because you are so beautiful!

[NESSAROSE]
Oh, Boq, I think you're wonderful!
And we deserve each other
Don't you see, this is our chance?
We deserve each other
Don't we, Boq?

[BOQ]
You know what?
Let's dance

[NESSAROSE, spoken]
What?!

[BOQ, sung]
Let's dance!

[ALL]
Dancing through life down at the Ozdust
If only because dust is what we come to!
And the strange thing, your life could end up changing
While you're dancing through!
