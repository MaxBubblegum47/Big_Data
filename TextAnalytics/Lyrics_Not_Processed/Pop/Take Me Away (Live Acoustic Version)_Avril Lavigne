[Verse 1]
I cannot find a way to describe it
It's there inside, all I do is hide
I wish that it would just go away
What would you do, you do if you knew?
What would you do?

[Chorus]
All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable, come and take me away

[Verse 2]
I feel like I am all alone
All by myself, I need to get around this
My words are cold, I don't want them to hurt you
If I show you, I don't think you'd understand
'Cause no one understands

[Chorus]
All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable, come and take me away

[Bridge]
I'm going nowhere (On and on and)
I'm getting nowhere (On and on)
Take me away
I'm going nowhere (On and off and off and on)
(And off and on)

[Chorus]
All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable, come and take me away

[Outro]
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
