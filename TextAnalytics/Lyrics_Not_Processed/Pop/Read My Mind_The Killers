[Verse 1]
On the corner of Main Street
Just trying to keep it in line
You say you wanna move on and
You say I'm falling behind
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?

[Verse 2]
I never really gave up on
Breaking out of this two-star town
I got the green light, I got a little fight
I'm gonna turn this thing around
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)

[Chorus 1]
The good old days, the honest man
The restless heart, the Promised Land
A subtle kiss that no one sees
A broken wrist and a big trapeze
Oh, well, I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you go, can you read my mind?

[Verse 3]
Itâ€™s funny how you just break down
Waiting on some sign
I pull up to the front of your driveway
With magic soaking my spine
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)

[Chorus 2]
The teenage queen, the loaded gun
The drop dead dream, the Chosen One
A southern drawl, a world unseen
A city wall and a trampoline
Oh, well, I don't mind, if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you jump, tell me what you find
When you read my mind

[Bridge]
Slipping in my faith until I fall
He never returned that call
Woman, open the door, don't let it sting
I wanna breathe that fire again
She said, "I don't mind, if you don't mind (I don't mind, if you don't mind)
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine" (I don't shine if you don't shine)
Put your back on me, put your back on me (I don't mind, if you don't mind)
Oh, put your back on me
Oooh

[Outro]
The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun
Can you read my mind? (Oooh oooh)
