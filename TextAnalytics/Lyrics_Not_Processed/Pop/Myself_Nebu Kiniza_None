[Verse 1]
I get money by myself
I been doing it by myself
All day errrday grind hard
With no help
What you mean 3rd degree
Burn slow let it melt
I barely keep people around me I got
10 blunts to myself
I smoke the good kush
When I'm in LA
Bitches comin in, I tell em andale
Lets have a good time
Yeah you know
I get served up somethin' after every show (every show)
First thing first can't take no vacations
First thing first gotta beat them court cases
Got mimosa in my bottle with a model
And she suckin' fuckin
Rollin of a half a bean
I told her lets go hit the streets

[Chorus]
I smoke kush by myself
I get money by myself
I get b*tches by myself
And I make movies by myself x2

Get it x4 (yeah yeah yeah)
Get it x4 (yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
Neva had no patience
Waited for nobody
I feel like the mayor when I'm in the party
Bruce Wayne, Lue kang
Kick it like karate
I can take yo bitch
And bend her like Pilates
1 to the 2
3 to the 4
Run to the money when I swing my door
Got 2 fine bitches in the backseat of the banshee
With the blue cheese no 10 piece
Errrbody wanna talk that shoulda coulda woulda
Ima young go getta, gotta get it by the second
Every minute ima flip it like a quarter ima gone and fuck ya daughter
Ima get it x3
Can't waste no time ima fuck yo dime
Ima get my pockets bigger than a ramada
Jump I'm the front row seat in the front row seat
Jump in the game like rah rah rah rah
Ima young hippy nigga
Float like a bubble bee
Smoke like a chimney
Bitch named Tiffany
She love suckin me
Everyday x2 all night (aye)

She gone act a fool on the dick x2(yeah yeah yeah)
She gone act a fool on the dick like x2(yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
I smoke kush by myself
I get money by myself
I get bitches by myself
And I make movies by myself x2

Get it x4 (yeah yeah yeah)
Get it x4 (yeah yeah yeah)
