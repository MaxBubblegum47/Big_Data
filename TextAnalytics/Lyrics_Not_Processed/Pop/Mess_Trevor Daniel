[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sick, holes in my mind
I can't get you out of my head this time
You don't need nobody else, it's just you and I
If you need somebody, baby, I'm by your side

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wake up 'cause I miss your face
And it's been some time since we've been in the same place
And it eats my brain, oh, I miss your face
And it's been some time since we've been in the same place
I don't wanna wake up 'cause I miss your face
And it's been some time since we've been in the same place
And it eats my brain, oh, I miss your face
And it's been some time since we've been in the same place

[Verse]
And I know we're both busy
Why don't you meet me in the city
I don't want the memories to fade
But, baby, it's alright, take a sip if you wanna
Let's take a ride, we can hit the north side
I might book a flight for just you and I
Got me up all night thinking 'bout the words you said
I got used to you laying in my bed, baby

[Bridge]
I'm a mess, I'm a mess
Whenever you gone, I get in my head
I'm a mess, I'm a mess
Whenever you gone, I wish I was dead

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sick, holes in my mind
I can't get you out of my head this time
You don't need nobody else, it's just you and I
If you need somebody, baby, I'm by your side

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wake up 'cause I miss your face
And it's been some time since we've been in the same place
And it eats my brain, oh, I miss your face
And it's been some time since we've been in the same place
I don't wanna wake up 'cause I miss your face
And it's been some time since we've been in the same place
And it eats my brain, oh, I miss your face
And it's been some time since we've been in the same place

[Outro]
I'm a mess, I'm a mess
I'm a mess, I'm a mess
I'm a mess, I'm a mess
Whenever you call, I get in my head
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
