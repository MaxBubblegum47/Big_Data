[Verse 1]
Empty mansion, in the rain just off the coast
Is the vibe now, that I feel inside my soul
Like a spider, there's a web that you have wove
There's a heart now, where there used to be a ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
And ooh, yeah it's making me uneasy
And ooh, yeah it's making me uneasy
It's freaking, it's freaking, it's freaking
It's freaking, it's freaking, it's freaking
It's freaking, it's freaking, it's freaking
It's freaking, it's freaking me out

[Chorus]
Now I hear sounds in the hallway
Rocking chairs are moving on thеir own
I'm falling for you
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking mе out
So much so that it's freaking me out

[Verse 2]
There's a silence, in the woods after it snows
That's the vibe now, of the piece inside my soul
Like a spider, there's a web that you have wove
There's a heart now, where there used to be a ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
And ooh, yeah it's making me uneasy
And ooh, yeah it's making me uneasy
It's freaking, it's freaking, it's freaking
It's freaking, it's freaking, it's freaking
It's freaking, it's freaking, it's freaking
It's freaking, it's freaking me out
It's freaking me out
It's freaking me out
It's freaking me out

[Chorus]
Now I hear sounds in the hallway
Rocking chairs are moving on their own
I'm falling for you
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me
