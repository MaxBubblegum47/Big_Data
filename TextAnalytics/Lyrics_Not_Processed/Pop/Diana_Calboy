Baby, we could take it all away
Fast whips, cash trips, ass crisp

Hit it from the back wit' her archin' (Wit' her archin')
Have her leavin' with a limp when she walkin' (When she walkin')

She said she wanna be a teacher
Damn, in my head, she would look good as a teacher (Teacher)

Home run, home run like Jeter (Jeter)
Don't make me catch you cheatin', beat her (Bad boy)

She said, "Oh, her brother's Wooin'" (Woo)
She said she's seen' me around (Yup)
She said she love what I'm doin' (I love it)
She said, "Do you remember me?" (Me)
"You was a friend to me"
We start talkin' sexually, it's been a while
