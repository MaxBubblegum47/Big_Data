[Verse]
Renegade by nature child of the wild
Wrestling with danger right into the arms of the night
Fear ain't going to save you, so run for your life
Let the moment take you right into the arms of the light

[Pre-Chorus]
When thunder roars, the winds will blow
And through the storm, Iâ€™ll ride alone

[Chorus]
Walls can't contain me, nothing can chain me
Unbreakable tonight
No tears will I cry, my animal eyes, unbreakable
I'm unbreakable, unbreakable
