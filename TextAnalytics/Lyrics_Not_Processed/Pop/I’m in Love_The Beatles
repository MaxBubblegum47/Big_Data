Every night I can't sleep thinking of you
And every little thing that you do
And I'm telling all my friends I'm in love
And I'm telling the world you make me feel proud
You make me want to shout out aloud
So I'm telling all my friends I'm in love
Oh, I'm feeling on the top of the world
I'm in love with a wonderful girl
I've never felt this way before
If this is love, give me more, more, more, more
...I'm telling you
...thing that you do
I'm telling all my friends I'm in love, in love
Yes, I'm telling all my friends I'm in love, in love
I'm telling all my friends I'm in love
