[Verse 1]
Turning over in my bed
Lose myself to dreams instead
Ghostly figures on the walls
Dreams of you have grown so tall

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Gone inside your talk
Inside your smile, I'm unraveling
Caught within your stare
Within your touch, such a subtle sting

[Chorus]
Love the way you make me feel, I want it all the time
Hate the way you make me feel, you're all that's on my mind
Losing track and losing time, and I forget to breathe
Should've seen the water rising, now I'm in too deep

[Verse 2]
Standing in my room alone
Yet I'm feeling far from home
Tired as my knuckles white
I've been holdin on too tight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Stay, you're in my head
You're in my words, even when you're gone
Sick, I've caught your eye
I've caught your chill, and I still hold on

[Chorus]
Love the way you make me feel, I want it all the time
Hate the way you make me feel, you're all that's on my mind
Losing track and losing time, and I forget to breathe
Should've seen the water rising, now I'm in too deep
