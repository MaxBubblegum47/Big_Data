[Verse 1: Jade Novah]
Welcome into my garden of Eden
I was guarding my heart for a reason
Call it sin and they might call it treason
I call it love
I was trapped in the dark till you found me
Pull me in let temptation surround me
But the moment your arms are around me
I fall in love

[Pre-Chorus: Jade Novah]
Though their voices may echo
Promise I'll never let go
Promise you'll never let go

[Chorus: Jade Novah]
So what do we do when they say our love is forbidden?
And what if I don't wanna pray our love is forgiven?
I'm willing to fight every day of life that I'm given
You're a rule that I'm willing to break
An exception I'm willing to make
You're a risk that I'm willing to take

[Verse 2: Todrick Hall]
Take my hand I know love's the solution
And breathe in this love-scented pollution
Welcome into the new revolution
I call it hope
Let them build up a wall to devide us
Let them use all their weapons to fight us
All we need is something to ignite us
And I call it hope

[Pre-Chorus: Todrick Hall]
Though their voices may echo
Promise I'll never let go
Promise you'll never let go

[Chorus: Todrick Hall]
So what do we do when they say our love is forbidden?
And what if I don't wanna pray our love is forgiven?
I'm willing to fight every day of life that I'm given
You're a rule that I'm willing to break
An exception I'm willing to make
You're a risk that I'm willing to take

[Bridge: Todrick Hall, Jade Novah, Keala Settle & (Ensemble)]
You're a risk that I'm willing to (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
You're a risk that I'm willing to take (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Yeah
And all we know
It might be us against the world
Our voices will be heard
(The sun shining from the rooftops, I'll sing from the top of my lungs. Until the war is done and the battle of love is won. We're not gonna run, we're not gonna run)
We're not gonna run
Our love is forbidden
Our love is forgiven (I'm willing to fight everyday)
Oh life that I've been given
(A rule that I'm willing to, break
An exception I'm willing to, make
You're a risk that I'm willing to take)

(Take my heart, I'm willing, our love will not be forbidden) x5

You're a rule that I'm willing to break
An exception I'm willing to make
You're a risk that I'm willing to

[Outro: (Ensemble) & Keala Settle ]
(Take my heart 'cause I'm willing, our love will not be forbidden)
Our love won't be forbidden
