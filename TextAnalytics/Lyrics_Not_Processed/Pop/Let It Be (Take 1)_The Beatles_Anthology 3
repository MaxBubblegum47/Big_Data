[Spoken Word: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Are we supposed to giggle in the solo?
Yeah
Okay
This'll.. This is gonna knock you out boy

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 2]
When all the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
But though they may be parted there is
Still a chance for that to see
There will be an answer, let it be

[Chorus]
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Yeah, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 3]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

[Chorus]
Yeah, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Yeah, oh let it be, let it be

[Spoken Word: John Lennon]
I think that was rather grand
I'd take one home with me
Okay lets track it
You bounder! You cheat!
