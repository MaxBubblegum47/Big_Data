[Verse]
Nothing's in the photograph
I've got lights in the way
You're gone and out of mind and I
Wish you would stay
Falling out of my head
Got a twisted sense of time
Feels like I'm turning red
Feel so alive

[Break]
Nothing's in the photograph
I've got lights in the way

[Verse]
Nothing's in the photograph
I've got lights in the way
You're gone and out of mind and I
Wish you would stay
Falling out of my head
Got a twisted sense of time
Feels like I'm turning red
Feel so alive
