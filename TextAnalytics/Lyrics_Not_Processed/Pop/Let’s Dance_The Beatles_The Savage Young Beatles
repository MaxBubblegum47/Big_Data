Hey baby, won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance
Let's dance, come on, let's dance
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
Come on, come on, let's dance
Hey baby, woh, you thrill me so
Hold me tight, don't let me go
Hey hey, hey, come on, let's dance
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
Come on, hey, come on, let's twist, alright
Hey, baby, if you're all alone
Maybe you'll let me walk you home
Hey, hey, come on, let's dance
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
Come on, hey, come on, let's dance
Hey, baby, things are swinging right

Come on, hey, come on, let's dance, oh
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old thing that you wanna do
Come on, oh come on, let's dance
Hey, let's dance, come on, let's dance
Come on, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
Come on, oh yeah, oh yeah
