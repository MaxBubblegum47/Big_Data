[Intro]
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me

[Verse 1]
Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
Don't care what you say to me
I'ma bite your feelings out (Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
I missed you in the basement
(Gold up in my teeth)
But your brother was a good substitute for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you love me, love me, but you never let me go
When the roof was on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry, honey, but you never really show
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know

[Chorus]
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Without ever letting you know

[Verse 2]
Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
Tastes like money when I speak
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
And I missed you in the basement, yeah
(Gold up in my teeth)
Bodies on the pavement
(Oh, gold up in my teeth)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you love me, love me, but you never let me go
And my roof was on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry, honey, but you never really show (Gold up in my teeth)
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know

[Chorus]
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Without ever letting you know

[Verse 3]
Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
Taste like money when I speak
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
And I missed you in the basement, yeah
(Gold up in my teeth)
Bodies on the pavement (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you love me, love me, but you never let me go
And my roof was on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry, honey, but you never really show (Gold up in my teeth)
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know

[Chorus]
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was, on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Without ever letting you know
