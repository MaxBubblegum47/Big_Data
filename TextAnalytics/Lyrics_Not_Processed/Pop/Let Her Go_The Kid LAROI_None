[Intro]
In love with the money
In love with the money
In love with the money
In love with the money

[Pre-Chorus]
What's the call?
In love with the money, it's "Fuck 'em all"
Heard you fucked on my bro, I can't fuck with ya
I don't want her unless she gon' do the dawgs
I got everything I ever prayed for
Lil' shawty gon' suck it right through the draws
R.I.P. to the ones I forever lost
R.I.P. to the money, I ran it up

[Chorus]
If she bad, Michael Jack', I'ma let her know (Know)
And if she do how she say, then I can't let her go, woah
I can't let her go (Uh-uh)
I can't let her go (Uh-uh)
I can't let her go (Uh-uh)
I can't let her go (Uh-uh)

[Verse]
Yeah, on and on, she go on and on, on, on
Bitch, get up off my motherfuckin' phone, phone, phone
R.I.P. Speaker Knockerz, get these bands on my lone, lone, lone
Come collect the check then fuck it up, woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, new Benz, too bad, I'ma see you later, shawty
New Rick, new Raf, fuck about a hater, homie
I do what I do 'cause I am who I am
Yeah, I don't need a reason or an explanation

[Bridge]
And that's just the way it is, the way, the way
And that's just the way it is, the way, the way
Young and rich and on my own
And that's why she keep callin' my phone

[Pre-Chorus]
What's the call?
In love with the money, it's "Fuck 'em all"
Heard you fucked on my bro, I can't fuck with ya
I don't want her unless she gon' do the dawgs
I got everything I ever prayed for
Lil' shawty gon' suck it right through the draws
R.I.P. to the ones I forever lost
R.I.P. to the money, I ran it up

[Chorus]
If she bad, Michael Jack', I'ma let her know (Know)
And if she do how she say, then I can't let her go, woah
I can't let her go (Uh-uh)
I can't let her go (Uh-uh)
I can't let her go (Uh-uh)
I can't let her go (Uh-uh)
