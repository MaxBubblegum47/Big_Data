[Verse 1]
The way you stumble in the kitchen
Looking for that first cup of joe
How you put on your mascara
Staring in the mirror on your tippy-toes
And if you wonder why I love you baby
I can boil it down to just one thing

[Chorus]
Yeah everything
Every little thing about you baby turns me on
(If it ain't one thing it's another)
I can't explain
How everything about you turns me on
(If it ain't one thing it's another)
Oh it turns me on, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on

[Verse 2]
The sexy way you say "Hey baby
When you see my number on your phone
The way you bit your lip when Mama said
"You cooked the chicken way too long
Girl be careful what you do and say

[Chorus]
Yeah everything
Every little thing about you baby turns me on
(If it ain't one thing it's another)
I can't explain
How everything about you turns me on
(If it ain't one thing it's another)
Oh it turns me on, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on

[Outro]
The way you walk, the way you smile
The way you kiss, it drives me wild
The way you laugh, the way you sing
Girl you know it's everything
The way you talk, the way you drive
The way you make me feel alive
The way you whisper "I love you
Everything you do just turns me on, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on
