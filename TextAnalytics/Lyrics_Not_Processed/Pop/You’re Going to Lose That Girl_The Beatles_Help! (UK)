[Chorus]
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)

[Verse 1]
If you don't take her out tonight
She's gonna change her mind (She's gonna change her mind)
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind (I'm gonna treat her kind)

[Chorus]
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)

[Verse 2]
If you don't treat her right, my friend
You're gonna find her gone, (You're gonna find her gone)
'Cause I will treat her right, and then
You'll be the lonely one (You're not the only one)

[Chorus]
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna loooooooo... (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)

[Bridge]
I'll make a point
Of taking her away from you
(Watch what you do)
Yeah
The way you treat her
What else can I do?

[Guitar solo]
(You're gonna lose that girl)
(You're gonna lose that girl)

[Chorus]
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna loooooooo... (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)

[Bridge]
I'll make a point
Of taking her away from you
(Watch what you do)
Yeah
The way you treat her
What else can I do?

[Verse 3]
If you don't take her out tonight
She's gonna change her mind (She's gonna change her mind)
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind (I'm gonna treat her kind)

[Chorus]
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
