[Verse 1]
All my life I've been a good girl
Tryna do what's right, never told no lies
Then you came around and suddenly my world
Turned upside down, now there's no way out

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to fight against it, shut out what all my friends said
Can't get you out of my head, oh-woah-woah-woah-woah
I keep letting you in, though I know it's not a good thing
I got you under my skin, oh-woah-woah-woah

[Chorus]
You're so outta line
You make me bad and I don't know why
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya
I'm out of my mind
You got me runnin' all the red lights
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh) That's what I like about ya
(Ooh) Yeah, that's what I like about ya
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh) That's what I like about ya
(Ooh) Yeah, that's what I like about ya

[Verse 2]
I don't care if my daddy don't think we're the perfect pair
It's my affair
Yeah, I don't know why my momma worries when I'm out all night
She thinks I'm nine, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to fight against it, shut out what all my friends said
Can't get you out of my head, oh-woah-woah-woah-woah
I keep letting you in, though I know it's not a good thing
I got you under my skin, oh-woah-woah-woah

[Chorus]
You're so outta line
You make me bad and I don't know why
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya
I'm out of my mind
You got me runnin' all the red lights
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh) That's what I like about ya
(Ooh) Yeah, that's what I like about ya
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh) That's what I like about ya
(Ooh) Yeah, that's what I like about ya

[Bridge]
I'm a fool for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to fight against it, shut out what all my friends said
Can't get you out of my head (Out of my head, out of my head)
I keep letting you in, though I know it's not a good thing
I got you under my skin, oh-woah-woah-woah

[Chorus]
You're so out of line (You're so outta line)
You make me bad and I don't know why (I don't know why)
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya (Yeah, that's what I like)
I'm out of my mind
You got me runnin' all the red lights (You got me runnin')
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh) That's what I like about ya
(Ooh) Yeah, that's what I like about ya
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh, make me bad and I don't know)
(Ooh) That's what I like about ya
(Ooh) Yeah, that's what I like about ya
