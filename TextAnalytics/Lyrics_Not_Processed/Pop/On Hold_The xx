[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
I don't blame you
We got carried away
I can't hold on
To an empty space

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sim]
Now you've found a new star to orbit
It could be love
I think you're too soon to call us old
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold

[Chorus 1: Oliver Sim]
And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold

[Post-Chorus 1: Oliver Sim & Hall & Oates]
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body
You've got the body, you've got the body
I thought I had you on hold
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to

[Verse 2: Romy Madley Croft]
My young heart chose to believe
We were destined
Young hearts
All need love
Call it a lesson
The stars and the charts
And the cards make sense
Only when we want them to
When I lie awake staring in to space
I see a different view

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sim]
Now you've found a new star to orbit
It could be love
I think you're too soon to call us old
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold

[Chorus 2: Oliver Sim]
And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold

[Post-Chorus 2: Hall & Oates]
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body
You've got the body, you've got the body
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to (draw the line)?
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to

[Chorus 2: Oliver Sim]
And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold
