Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me, when you're not strong 
(When you're not strong)

(Carry on)
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
 
(Gon' need)
Somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
If I have things that you need to borrow
For no one can fill
Those of your needs
That you won't let show

Serena Ryder

You just call on me brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

[Chorus: Geddy Lee & All]
Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend (I'll be your friend)

For, for it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

[Bridge: Ryland James & Marie-Mai]

When you need a hand (When you need a hand)
We all need somebody to lean on
On a tous les mêmes problèmes Pour qu’on se comprenne
We all need somebody to lean on (Yeah)

If there is a load you have to bear
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road
I'll share your load
If you just call me
