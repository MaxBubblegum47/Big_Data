[Intro]
Two, three, four
Oh, oh-oh
You're so good to me baby, baby

[Verse 1]
I wanna lock you up in my closet
When no one's around
I wanna put your hand in my pocket
Because you're allowed
I wanna drive you into the corner
And kiss you without a sound
I wanna stay this way forever
And I'll say it loud

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're in
And you can't get out

[Chorus]
You make me so hot, make me wanna drop
You're so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous, you're so good to me baby, baby
You're so good to me baby, baby

[Verse 2]
I can make you feel all better
Just take it in
And I can show you all the places
You've never been (Ah)
And I can make you say anything
That you never said
And I will let you do everything
Again and again, because

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're in
And you can't get out

[Chorus]
You make me so hot, make me wanna drop
You're so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous, you're so good to me baby, baby
You're so good to me baby, baby

[Bridge]
Kiss me gently
Always, I know
Hold me, love me
Don't ever go
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You make me so hot, make me wanna drop
You're so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous, you're so good to me

[Chorus]
You make me so hot, make me wanna drop (Yeah)
You're so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous (You're so good to me)
You're so good to me baby, baby
You're so good to me baby, baby
You're so good
