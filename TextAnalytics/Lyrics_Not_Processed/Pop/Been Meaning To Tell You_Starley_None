[Verse 1]
You've been on my mind
And I know it's bad timing
To say anything I feel
And it's probably surprising, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been too long and I heard that you moved on
But I just need to let you know
I pushed you away when your heart was right here
And now it's haunting me

[Chorus]
I've been meaning to tell you
Oh na na na na
I've been meaning to tell you
Oh, but now you're gone

[Post-Chorus]
I know that she loves you
But I know that you know that
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
I know that she loves you
But I had these feelings for you all along
Now you're gone

[Verse 2]
Been wanting to tell you
But it was too easy to live in a lie
I thought that I brought it out
'Til the train finally tipped on its side
That's when I knew I couldn't hide
That's when the trouble arrived
Thanking the bitter reminder
That you're no longer mine

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been too long and I heard that you moved on
But I just need to let you know
I pushed you away when your heart was right here
And now it's haunting me

[Chorus]
I've been meaning to tell you
Oh na na na na
I've been meaning to tell you
Oh, but now you're gone

[Post-Chorus]
I know that she loves you
But I know that you know that
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
I know that she loves you
But I had these feelings for you all along
Now you're gone

[Bridge]
It's been too long and I heard that you moved on
But I just need to let you know
I pushed you away when your heart was right here
And now it's haunting me

[Chorus]
I've been meaning to tell you
Oh na na na na
I've been meaning to tell you
Oh, but now you're gone

[Post-Chorus]
I know that she loves you
But I know that you know that
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
I know that she loves you
But I had these feelings for you all along
Now you're gone
