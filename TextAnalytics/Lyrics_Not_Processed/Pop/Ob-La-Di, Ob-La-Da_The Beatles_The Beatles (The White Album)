[Verse 1]
Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on

[Verse 2]
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store (Chu chu chu)
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (Ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her, she begins to sing (Sing)

[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Yeah

[Bridge]
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)

[Verse 3]
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (Arm, leg)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band (Yes!)

[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on (Heh-heh) (Yeah)
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on

[Bridge]
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha) (Yeah)

[Verse 4]
Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand (Foot)
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on (Yeah)
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on

[Outro]
And if you want some fun
Take Ob-la-di-bla-da
(Ahhh)
Thank you
