[Verse 1: Shaan Singh]
Woke up late
Somewhere far away from home
Pockets empty, wallet gone
The sun is streaming all on down on my face
Layin' down on someone's bed
A girl that I had hardly met
My head is spinnin' like I've been out days
Now you're waking up too
Lyin' next to me in your room
Not quite used to someone so new
Did ya catch my name? Yeah
Wonder how long I slept in
I don't know where the hell I've been
I know that's all right

[Chorus: Shaan Singh]
Last night, we met at one
Drank 'til two
Danced 'til four
Walked you home
Awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon
And now I want more

[Verse 2: Shaan Singh]
I got that taste, oh
It's in my mouth it's like I had too much last night
It just felt so right
Because of you, now
I could go or I could stay
'Cause I got nothing planned today
And I know that's all right

[Chorus: Shaan Singh]
Last night, we met at one
Drank 'til two
Danced 'til four
Walked you home
Awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon
And now I want more

[Bridge: Shaan Singh]
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy when the night's ours?
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy, yeah, so, so easy, oh

[Verse 3: Hailee Steinfeld]
Woke up late
Somewhere far away from home
Pockets empty, wallet gone
The sun is streaming all on down on my face
Yeah, last night was fun, let's do it again
We both know we're more than friends
And I know that's all right

[Chorus 3: Both, Hailee Steinfeld,  Shaan Singh]
Last night, we met at one
Drank 'til two (Yeah)
Danced 'til four
Walked you home
Awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon
And now I want more (More)
Last night
We met at one
Drank 'til two
Danced 'til four
I walked you home (Walked you home)
Awake 'til dawn (Wake 'til dawn)
Slept 'til noon
And now I want more

[Bridge: Shaan Singh & Hailee Steinfeld]
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy when the night's ours?
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy, yeah, so, so easy

[Outro: Both, Hailee Steinfeld, Shaan Singh]
Last night
We met at one
Drank 'til two
Danced 'til four
Walked you home
Awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon
And now I want more
