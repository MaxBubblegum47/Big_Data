People come, and people go
Sinking ships are all around us ('round us)
Day and night, worlds collide
Somewhere in the mess [?] us

None of that young Hollywood shit
We are the lovesick
Kids that people say
Be lovers, old and grey
I know one day, if we ever
Come down from heaven
God Himself would say
Remember the times

When we were dancing in the sky together
When we were laughing at the stormy weather
When we were burnin' 'til the morning light
Dancing in the sky
Dancing in the sky

Give me love, give me lust
Bleed the lines all around us ('round us)
Kiss my neck, take my breath
Be the drug I never give up (give up)

None of that young Hollywood shit
We are the lovesick
Kids that people say
Be lovers, old and grey
I know one day, if we ever
Come down from heaven
God Himself would say
Remember the times

When we were dancing in the sky together
When we were laughing at the stormy weather
When we were burnin' 'til the morning light
Dancing in the sky

Remember all those times
When we would touch the sky
And we would hold each other
And we would hold each other
Remember all those times
When we would touch the sky
And we would hold each other
Yeah, we would hold each other

When we were dancing in the sky together
When we were laughing at the stormy weather
When we were burnin' 'til the morning light
Dancing in the sky
Dancing in the sky
