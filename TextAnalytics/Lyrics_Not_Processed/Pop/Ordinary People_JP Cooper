[Chorus: JP Cooper]
If you wanna know something 'bout me
The blood in my veins is full of 
northern grit
I got that northern soul, man I got bags of it
We're far from ordinary people
And if you wanna know something 'bout us
The hearts in our chest are full of northern love
And even when we're broke, we'll always have enough
We're far from ordinary people

[Verse 1: Bugzy Malone]
Alright how can I say this
I'm from a place where, no-one expects us to make it
There was The Stone Roses and Oasis
But when they were big we were still babies
I'm talking to the new generation
And we wasn't born in the 80s
They say that we don't see many places
'Cause nobody left here for ages
Serious love for the people that raised us
Even though it got crazy
Poverty stricken but that never phased us
Not one of us lazy
And I'll be the first to say money don't change us
Well it didn't change me
I'll never forget where I came from - that's 'cause
It's the struggle that saved me
On the streets we got brought up
And we'd play on the grass 'cause we're tryna be pro footballers
They say there's no kings out here, nobody's got money, everyone of us paupers
I beg to differ... 'cause I see the bigger picture
Every one of us kings
We could live on the street
And make it a castle
Fuck what they call us
They can keep throwing out orders
In fact bring cameras and record us
We've been fighting for survival
And you're gonna learn what war does
Why did they call it an army?
That's 'cause it's filled with soldiers
There's a war going on outside and it's life
You can keep the revolvers

[Chorus: JP Cooper]
If you wanna know something 'bout me
The blood in my veins is full of northern grit
I got that northern soul, man I got bags of it
We're far from ordinary people
And if you wanna know something 'bout us
The hearts in our chest are full of northern love
And even when we're broke, we'll always have enough
We're far from ordinary people

[Verse 2: Bugzy Malone]
Okay, what did they expect?
They expect us to fail this test
They think 'cause we're broke and we're not blessed
Like we're gonna watch our parents stress
No chance...
And more time our parents are broken up anyway, there's no romance
And the car's been sold
And that's 'cause there's no keeping up with their finance
What do they want us to do?
Skip down the road to the job centre and just hold hands?
It's not easy out here, depression's a killer
Especially when you've got no plans
So much pain on a daily basis
Would you not grab the painkiller with both hands?
It's a shame the painkiller's weed and liquor
Strong enough to wipe out the whole gang
If I'm being brutally honest
I don't condone it, but I understand the stealing and the violence
Yeah man run when they hear the sirens
"No comment"
Leave the room in silence
That's the same boy who's mum got treated bad in the job centre on Friday
Dad don't care so he lacks the guidance
It's a shame that the streets are evil
But thats just where we grown up
And not everything was legal
But that's where we learnt to be tough
Most people grind to a halt
Like a car with no petrol or no diesel
But we keep it moving round here
'Cause we're far from ordinary people

[Chorus: JP Cooper]
If you wanna know something 'bout me
The blood in my veins is full of northern grit
I got that northern soul, man I got bags of it
We're far from ordinary people
And if you wanna know something 'bout us
The hearts in our chest are full of northern love
And even when we're broke, we'll always have enough
We're far from ordinary people

[Bridge: JP Cooper]
I see the raindrops falling again
We look up to greet the heavens
Who cares if we had harsh beginnings
We know congruence

[Chorus: JP Cooper]
If you wanna know something 'bout me
The blood in my veins is full of northern grit
I got that northern soul, man I got bags of it
We're far from ordinary people
And if you wanna know something 'bout us
The hearts in our chest are full of northern love
And even when we're broke, we'll always have enough
We're far from ordinary people

[Outro]
We're far from ordinary people...
