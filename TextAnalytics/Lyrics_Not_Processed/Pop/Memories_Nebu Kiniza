[Intro]
You know
This whole process of me making forever happy and shit like that
I was going through hella shit
Damn, I didn't even expect the hi...
Nah, nah, we can keep going
I didn't expect the hi-hats to come in I don't wanna keep up with being boring and shit
You know a lot of things were blocking me from being happy so
Anyway

[Chorus]
I've been on the path while I was still building the road
All these memories, oh yea, I swear they made me cold
Open up my eyes and realize that I can see
Now i'm doing everything I swear that I believe
I've been on the path while I was still building the road
All these memories, oh yea, I swear they made me cold
Open up my eyes and realize that I can see
Now i'm doing everything I swear that I believe

[Verse]
Swear that I believed it
Why the fuck you think I achieved it
If I got a bitch i'm never cheating
Yea, give me a reason
Yea, baby give me a reason
Look at the season
Yea, baby look at the season
Yea, give me a reason
Yea, baby give me a reason
Look at the season
Yea, baby look at the season
Take you out to Pluto, Mars
Then we go to Venus
Bitch you know you is a star
Why you tryna play me for
I've been ten toes down
Show me love around the town
Pick her up and dick her down
Pick her up and dick her down
Kill them with the flow not the remix
When I get that dome, I believe it
I've been on the road for the evening
Sipping on the drank I be leaning
Bad bitch want a Birkin
But her attitude not worth it
Everyday i'm working
Everyday i'm working
Gotta go and get it for the low low
I could never ever be loco
Yea my wrist like magic
All of my bitches fantastic
All of my coupes yea I feel like these bitches all love 'em inside
Know you wanna ride
Know you wanna ride, yea , yea

[Bridge]
No, you can not ride with me
'Cus I know you going
Hah, sorry, kidding
Fuck it, yea, yea, ooh

[Chorus]
I've been on the path while I was still building the road
All these memories, oh yea, I swear they made me cold
Open up my eyes and realize that I can see
Now i'm doing everything I swear that I believe
I've been on the path while I was still building the road
All these memories, oh yea, I swear they made me cold
Open up my eyes and realize that I can see
Now i'm doing everything I swear that I believe
