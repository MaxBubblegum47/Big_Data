[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby I can't stop thinking 'bout last night
Still taste your kiss, still taste the wine
Tryna to turn this ten minute drive to five
Oh, I've been
Daydreaming 'bout you all day long
Radio's been playing all our songs
Just read your message on my phone
It's turning me on

[Chorus]
When you say you need me
And you just got to see me
And all you want is me right now
Oh baby just wait a minute
If you're in your bed stay in it
I'm about to dive on in it
Got to got to get you closer
I'm about to bring you on over

[Post Chorus]
Twisted you up in inside the sheets
I bet you don't get no sleep
(I'm gettin' closer)
Make a little love to a Motown beat
Catching your groove with me
I'm about to bring it on over

[Verse 2]
I know that key's under the mat
So girl just stay right where you're at
Be right beside you just like that
I want you so bad
Girl let's pick up where we left off
A little more love, a lot less talk
About to hear my footsteps down your hall
Hang on

[Chorus]
When you say you need me
And you just got to see me
And all you want is me right now
Oh baby just wait a minute
If you're in your bed stay in it
I'm about to dive on in it
Got to got to get you closer
I'm about to bring you on over

[Post Chorus]
Twisted you up in inside the sheets
I bet you don't get no sleep
(I'm gettin' closer)
Make a little love to a Motown beat
Catching your groove with me
I'm about to bring it on over

[Bridge]
Wanna see our shadows on the wall
Wanna see your beautiful body
Ain't nobody gonna stop me
I'm about to bring it on over
Bring it on over
Yeah, bring it on over
Bring it on over

[Chorus]
When you say you need me
And you just got to see me
And all you want is me right now
Oh baby just wait a minute
If you're in your bed stay in it
I'm about to dive on in it
Got to got to get you closer
I'm about to bring you on over

[Post Chorus]
Twisted you up in inside the sheets
I bet you don't get no sleep
(I'm gettin' closer)
Make a little love to a Motown beat
Catching your groove with me
I'm about to bring it on over
Twisted you up in inside the sheets
I bet you don't get no sleep
(I'm gettin' closer)
Make a little love to a Motown beat
Catching your groove with me
I'm about to bring it on over
