Life's too short to be sittin' 'round miserable
People gon' talk whether you doing bad or good
Got a drink on my mind and my mind on my money
Looking so bomb

[KAREN & IVY]
Gonna find me a honey

[IVY]
Got my Ray-Bans on and I'm feelin' hella cool tonight
Everybody's vibin', so don't nobody start a fight

[KAREN & IVY]
Cheers to the freakin' weekend
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Oh, let the Jameson sink in
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Don't let the bastards get ya down
Turn it around with another round
There's a party at the bar, everybody put your glasses up
And I drink to that
I drink to that

[IVY]
'Bout to hop on the bar, put it all on my card tonight, yeah
Might be mad in the morning, but you know we goin' hard tonight

[IVY]
Got my Ray-Bans on and I'm feelin' hella cool tonight
Everybody's vibin' so don't nobody start a fight

[KAREN & IVY]
Cheers to the freakin weekend
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Oh let the Jameson sink in
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Don't let the bastards get ya down
Turn it around with another round
There's a party at the bar, everybody put your glasses up
And I drink to that
I drink to that
And I drink to that

[KAREN]
I drink to that

[IVY]
