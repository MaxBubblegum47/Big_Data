[Verse 1]
I've been keeping little things away from you
Just outside of your view
I was banking on a mess, I'm bound to this
I can't keep playing cool

[Pre-Chorus]
You go on and on and leave me vacant
Hang me out to dry and call it over
Running out of lies to keep it beating
You're much better off to walk away

[Chorus]
I know if I keep it from you, keep it from you (ocean)
Drives around in Malibu
I know if I tell you the truth, tell you truth (I might)
Lose you, so it's better if I keep it from you

[Post-Chorus]
Better, better
Better if I keep it from you
Better, better
Better if I keep it from you

[Verse 2]
When it's easier to lie than tell the truth
It's like I'm split in two
I'm an enemy of me, not hard to see
Got nothing to do with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You go on and on and leave me vacant
Hang me out to dry and call it over
Running out of lies to keep it beating
You're much better off to walk away

[Chorus]
I know if I keep it from you, keep it from you (ocean)
Drives around in Malibu
I know if I tell you the truth, tell you truth (I might)
Lose you, so it's better if I keep it from you

[Post-Chorus]
Better, better
Better if I keep it from you
Better, better
Better if I keep it from you

[Pre-Chorus]
You go on and on and leave me vacant
Hang me out to dry and call it over
Running out of lies to keep it beating
You're much better off to walk away

[Chorus]
I know if I keep it from you, keep it from you (ocean)
Drives around in Malibu
I know if I tell you the truth, tell you truth (I might)
Lose you, so it's better if I keep it from you

[Post-Chorus]
Better, better
Better if I keep it from you
Better, better
Better if I keep it from you
