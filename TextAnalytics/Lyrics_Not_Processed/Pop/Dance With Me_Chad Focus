[Verse: Raeliss]
Come around for the good times
You know we about to have a good night
Everybody in the building looking so nice
Sipping Henny and you know it got me so right
My guys, and yo' girls, come inside of my world
Put your hands up in the air
You dont wanna be no where but right here
And it only gotta be you and me
We can dance to this song everyday
We can go til' the tanks on E
You already know the drinks on me
You ain't gotta front you can do it like that
And tell the DJ that he gotta bring it back
For the moment I'm tryna' make it last
One more toast, can you raise your glass

[Hook: Chad]
