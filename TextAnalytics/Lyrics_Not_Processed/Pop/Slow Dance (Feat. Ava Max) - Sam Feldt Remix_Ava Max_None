[Verse 1: AJ Mitchell]
If you stay for this minute
Girl, I'll never let you down
We ain't off the limit
I could hold you after now

[Pre-Chorus: AJ Mitchell]
No more talking, I don't know what you wanna do with that
It feels good, why you even wanna hold it back?
We just work and I know there's no coming back
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?

[Chorus: AJ Mitchell]
I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now
I need a romance, one chance
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now
I need a romance, one chance
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
(I just wanna know, will you slow dance?)
(Wanna know, will you slow dance?)
I wanna
(I just wanna know, will you slow dance?)
(Wanna know, will you slow dancе?)

[Verse 2: Ava Max & AJ Mitchell]
And do you mind if I say it?
Just wanna have you around (Oh)
We take, thеn we give it
Something lifts us off the ground, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Ava Max & AJ Mitchell]
No more talk, I don't know what you wanna do with that
It feels good, why you even wanna hold it back? (Hold it back)
We just work, so I know that there's no going back
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?

[Chorus: Ava Max & AJ Mitchell]
I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now (If you're feeling me now)
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now
I need a romance (Romance), one chance (One chance)
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now (If you're feeling me now)
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now (Killing me now)
I need a romance, one chance (One chance)
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
(I just wanna know, will you slow dance?)
(Wanna know, will you slow dance?)
I wanna
(I just wanna know, will you slow dance?)
(Wanna know, will you slow dance?)

[Chorus: Ava Max & AJ Mitchell]
I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now (Killing me now, no, no, no, no)
I need a romance, one chance
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now (Killing me now)
I need a romance, one chance (One chance)
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
