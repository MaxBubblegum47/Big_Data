[Verse 1]
Everything means everything
Or nothing means nothing
So why hide your expletives under your breath?
Cause all you ever wanna do
Is take all my clothes off
So you can show me
There’s no reason to be upset

[Pre-Chorus]
You could convince me to
Tie my hair back
Relive the years I’ve left behind
You could convince me to
Stay up all night with you
While you leave me
Underdressed and out of time

[Chorus]
Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to the fucking roof
Made it
Give me just a little truth
Leave me
Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to a different view
Change it
All I ever wanna do
Is stay here (stay, stay, stay here.)

[Verse 2]
Everything means everything
And nothing is numbing
Can’t avoid the consequence
So don’t get upset
Cause all you ever wanna do
Is take all my clothes off
Watch me make you promises
I can regret

[Pre-Chorus: VÉRITÉ]
You could convince me to
Tie my hair back
Relive the years I’ve left behind
You could convince me to
Stay up all night with you
While you leave me
Underdressed and out of time

[Chorus]
Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to the fucking roof
Made it
Give me just a little truth
Leave me
Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to a different view
Change it
All I ever wanna do is
Stay here

[Bridge]
Stay here, stay here, stay here, stay here

[Chorus]
Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to the fucking roof
Made it
Give me just a little truth
Leave me
Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to a different view
Change it
All I ever wanna do is
Stay here

[Outro]
All I ever wanna do stay
All I ever wanna do stay
All I ever wanna do stay
All I ever wanna do
Stay here
