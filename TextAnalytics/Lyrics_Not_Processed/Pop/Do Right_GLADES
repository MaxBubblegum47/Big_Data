[Verse 1]
Take me back to when
I picked a fight with you
Right out of the blue
I wish we made amends
I didn't mean to lose
All the good times that I had with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
If it doesn't mean too much right now
I know that you've probably forgotten
But these things still weigh me down
Take me back to when
I picked a fight with you, ooh

[Chorus]
I miss the way my mama knew what to do
She said to do right by your neighbour
And they'll do right by you
When we get older we can forget the truth
That if you do right by your neighbour
Then they'll do right by you

[Verse 2]
We play this like a game
Why do we pretend
That we were never friends?
When we both haven't changed
Enough to just forget
The windows we broke with another
The secrets we spoke

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
If it doesn't mean too much right now
I know that you've probably forgotten
But these things still weigh me down

[Chorus]
I miss the way my mama knew what to do
She said to do right by your neighbour
And they'll do right by you
When we get older we can forget the truth
That if you do right by your neighbour
Then they'll do right by you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
If it doesn't mean too much right now
I know that you've probably forgotten
But these things still weigh me down

[Chorus]
I miss the way my mama knew what to do
She said to do right by your neighbour
And they'll do right by you
When we get older we can forget the truth
That if you do right by your neighbour
Then they'll do right by you
