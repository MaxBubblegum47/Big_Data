[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Nights, flying down the 10, nearly 2 AM
Happiness begins
Days lifted in a haze, we weren't just a phase
We weren't just pretend (Just pretend)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up, palms out to the skies

[Chorus: Joe Jonas, 
Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas
]
It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster with you

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
But I'd come back and ride that roller coaster

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Faith led me to the clouds, reaching for the ground
'Cause life was upside down
Now everything has changed, we found better days
But I still hear the sound

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up, palms out to the skies

[Chorus: Joe Jonas, 
Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas
]
It was fun when we were young and now we're older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now we're older (Oh)
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now (Yeah)
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster with you

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woo-ooh-ooh (Yeah, with you)
Woo-ooh (With you, with you)
Woo-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
But I'd come back and ride that roller coaster

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
It was fun when we were young and now we're older (Oh)
Those days that are the worst, they seem to glow now (Yeah)
We were up-and-down and barely made it over
But I'd go back and ride that roller coaster

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Nights, flying down the 10, nearly 2 AM
Happiness begins
