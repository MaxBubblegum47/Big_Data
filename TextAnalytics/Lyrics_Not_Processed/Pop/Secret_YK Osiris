[Intro: Ann Marie]
Mm, mmm

[Chorus: Ann Marie]
We can keep it on the low (We can keep it on the low)
Swear nobody has to know (Uh, uh)
Baby, don't answer your phone (Yeah)
'Cause this our chance to be alone
Now, baby, come and make me moan
It can be our little secret, promise you can keep it
Call me when you need it, tell me you will be
Would you be my little secret?
Be my little secret? Be my little secret?
Tell me you will be

[Verse 1: Ann Marie]
Put your phone on DND
Now, baby, put that D in me
I love it when you deep in me
You bring out the freak in me
Tell me, do you get my drift?
"I'm gon' have your pussy wet"
This a night you won't forget
Together we're the perfect fit
See they wanna know (They wanna know)
Baby, they wanna know
What we got goin' on (What we got goin' on)
Baby, keep that unknown

[Chorus: Ann Marie & YK Osiris]
We can keep it on the low (We can keep it on the low)
Swear nobody has to know (Swear nobody gotta know)
Baby, don't answer your phone (Baby, don't answer your phone)
'Cause this our chance to be alone (No, no)
Now, baby come and make me moan (Come and make you moan)
It can be our little secret promise you can keep it (Promise I can keep it)
Call me when you need it
Tell me you will be (Yeah, yeah)
Would you be my little secret?
Be my little secret? (No, no)
Be my little secret? (No, no)
Tell me you will be
Would you be my little—

[Verse 2: YK Osiris]
Can I be your little secret?
I swear I'll keep it
I got your legs goin' crazy when I eat it
The way you moan and when I'm all up in your deep end
Them other niggas, they can't freak it like I freak it
Call me when you need it
You can get it on the weekend
Don't nobody gotta know, we can keep it on the low
Baby, I know that you grown, and, yeah, I'm grown, girl
Nobody gotta know whats goin' on

[Chorus: Ann Marie & YK Osiris]
We can keep it on the low (We can keep it on the low)
Swear nobody has to know (Swear nobody gotta know)
Baby, don't answer your phone (Baby, don't answer your phone)
'Cause this our chance to be alone (Yeah, yeah)
Now, baby come and make me moan (Yeah, yeah)
It can be our little secret promise you can keep it (Promise I can keep it)
Call me when you need it
Tell me you will be
Would you be my little secret?
Be my little secret? Be my little secret?
Tell me you will be
Would you be my little secret?
Be my little secret? Be my little secret?
Tell me you will be
Would you be my little secret?
Be my little secret? Be my little secret?
Tell me you will be
Would you be my little—
