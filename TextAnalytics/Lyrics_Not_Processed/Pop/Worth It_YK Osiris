[Intro]
I would give you the world, nah, nah, nah
(
Yo Kiwi, thank you bro
)
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it (Oh, oh, oh)
You don't gotta be perfect (Mm, mm, mm)
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah
But you don't gotta be perfect (Oh, oh, oh)
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, nah, nah

[Verse]
Everybody doubted me, but girl, you stuck around
And you told me, "If I hold you you gon' hold me down"
You don't gotta be perfect, you just gotta be worth it
Buyin' this and that, baby girl, you don't ever have to work again
Time is precious, baby girl, let's not let it go by
I just really wanna know, do you love me? Don't lie
I know you felt alone, huh, 'cause I been on the road, huh
But I been doin' shows, I swear I ain't doin' you wrong
Ridin' 'round through the city, yeah
Girl, you know you comin' with me, yeah
I been a hundred out of fifty, girl
Ain't nobody messin' with me, yeah
I don't really think they understand
Baby girl, I know you understand
I'm just tryna go feed my fam, hey-ey-ey, nah

[Chorus]
I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it (Oh, oh, oh)
You don't gotta be perfect (Mmh, mmh, mmh)
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah
But you don't gotta be perfect (Oh, oh, oh)
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, nah, nah

[Bridge]
Oh-woah, woah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah

[Chorus]
I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it (Oh, oh, oh)
You don't gotta be perfect (Mmh, mmh, mmh)
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it, yeah yeah
But you don't gotta be perfect (Oh, oh, oh)
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, nah, nah
