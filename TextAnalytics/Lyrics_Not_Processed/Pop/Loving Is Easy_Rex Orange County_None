[Chorus]
Loving is easy
You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah, loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen, girl
When you can't even hide it
And it didn't take forever to find it
I was all on my own
Almost glad to be alone
Until love came in on time, on time

[Chorus]
So loving is easy
You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah, loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Ah, ah
Oh, oh
Ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
So listen, girl
When you can't even hide it
And it didn't take forever to find it
I was all on my own
Almost glad to be alone
Until love came in on time, oh, on time

[Chorus]
Loving is easy
You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah, loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Ah, ah
Oh, oh
Ah, ah
