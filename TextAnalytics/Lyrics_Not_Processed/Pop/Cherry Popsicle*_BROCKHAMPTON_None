(Verse 1: Kevin Abstract and DJ Bobbito Garcia)
Pardon the, uh, Technical Difficulties
Less money talk, world peace baby
How many more times my team gon' see the (?) baby
Still in the heat baby, I'll buy the seat baby
See these trees baby, hanging 'round me baby
No Grammy nom, world phenomenon
Yeah I'm righting wrong, bread from writing songs
Pushin' [?] the timing was just right
I wouldn't have them thoughts without any of the rights
And I'll marry you now, [?]
Switch religions like a maze did, we ain't Christian right
I see the dollar sign where life crash, after the desert
But we did it together so I love my dawg forever

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
If I gotta swear on that forever, I'm not tryna
I'd get it right, Oh-oh
If you're gonna hate on me forever, can I change
And get it right, Oh-oh
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up

[Post-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
If I gotta swear on that forever, I'm not tryna
I'd get it right, Oh-oh
If you're gonna hate on me forever, can I change
And get it right, Oh-oh
(I got my back tonight, I got me)
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up
(I got your back tonight, I got you)
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, ayy
(I got me, I got you)
Look, you gotta do what you gotta do, shut up

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
And I've got your back tonight
I've got you
