[Verse 1: Jonathan Young]
He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it anymore obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

[Chorus 1]
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

[Verse 2: Jonathan Young]
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV

[Spoken]
Dude, are you serious?
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

[Spoken]
Okay, seriously dude?
Lee Albrecht [Spoken]
What?
Jonathan Young [Spoken]
Like, I'm trying to do a cover here...
Lee Albrecht [Spoken]
I don't see what the problem is!
Jonathan Young [Spoken]
Just hit the chorus, okay?
Lee Albrecht [Spoken]
Yeah, fine. I'm just trying to make it interesting...

[Chorus 2]
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

[Instrumental]
Jonathan Young [Spoken]
You know what? Fine! We'll do it your way, alright?!

[Bridge]
Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well tough luck, that boy's gone now
They are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
There's a soul that's deep inside

[Breakdown]
He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl...
Heheh, oh God...why did I do this song?
(Lee Albrecht {Spoken]: I have no idea.)
Uh... haven't you heard?
Yeah we rock each other's WOOORLD! (PLEASE, GOD, NO!)

[Chorus 3...4...um...]
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
I'm in a studio, singing this song Avril Lavigne wrote
About a girl he used to know
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
I'm in a studio, lip syncing this cover song
About a girl he used to know
I'm not a sk8er boi, but I do own a skateboard
I can't do any tricks
I'm in a studio, YouTube is miserable
And it never will be fixed
He was a sk8er boi, like, comment, subscribe boi
J-Just turn off the video...

[Spoken]
Just...Just put up the end card...I-I'm done...
Lee Albrecht [Spoken]
Hey. Hey, Jon. Ready... Wait for it...

[Short Instrumental]
Jonathan Young [Spoken]
Stop! Cut it out, stop, stop. The video's over
