[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
When she come over, don’t wanna leave
In my crib so much, she thought she had a set of keys
Let her fix me up a plate and even roll my weed
We could cuddle all day, girl, it’s fine with me (it’s cool, it’s cool)
If you wanna play it safe, rock you right to sleep
Go out on a date, take you out to eat
Twenty-five grand on a shopping spree
She ain't never got no plans, she just follow me, just swallow me

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Baby, just tell me what you wanna do
I'm easy, I'm easy, I'm easy
I'm easy, I'm easy, believe me
Baby, just tell me I won't disapprove
I'm easy, I'm easy, I'm easy
I'm easy, I'm easy, believe me

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
C'mon let me know, let me know
Help me now, let me know
C'mon let me know, let me know
Help me now, let me know

[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Joey Bada$$]
I'm good either way
If you want it like that you should show me
Either way
Gonna bring it back just like she owe me
Good either way
If you want it like that you should show me
Either way
Girl, just bring it back like you owe me
Um whatcha say? (Aye, whatcha say?)
Um whatcha say? Whatcha say?
Good either way (Good either way)
I'm good (Either way, either way homie)
Either way
Either way, either way, either way shawty
