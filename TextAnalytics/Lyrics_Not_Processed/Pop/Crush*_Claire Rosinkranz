Oh my head
Lay in my pillow
Close my eyes, think 'bout your face
Thinkin' 'bout the sunny picnics
On those perfect summer days
I remember when you told me
You wanted to take me on a date
But baby, we were [?]
Nothing left for me to chase
Open up our hearts
But sometimes life will close the door
All these pretty little things in life
We have to learn to ignore
Sometimes when you got a crush
The feeling often leaves you sore
All these pretty little things in life
We have to learn to ignore
It wasn't bad or complicated
It just wasn't meant to be
Kinda sucks but that's the way it goes
I think we both agree
When we first talked on the phone
I didn't think that there could be
Any thing that made us more
Than two kids talking through a screen
Open up our hearts
But sometimes life will close the door
All these pretty little things in life
We have to learn to ignore
Sometimes when you got a crush
The feeling often leaves you sore
All these pretty little things in life
We have to learn to ignore
