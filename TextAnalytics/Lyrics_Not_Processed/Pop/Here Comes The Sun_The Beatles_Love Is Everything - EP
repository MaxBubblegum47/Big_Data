Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's alright
Little darling, it's been a long, cold, lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
But here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's alright
Little darling, the smiles returning to the the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
But here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's alright
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Sun, sun, sun... here it comes
Sun, sun, sun... here it comes
Sun, sun, sun... here it comes
Sun, sun, sun... here it comes
Little darling, I feel the ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun, little darling
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's alright
Sun, sun, sun... here it comes
Sun, sun, sun... here it comes
