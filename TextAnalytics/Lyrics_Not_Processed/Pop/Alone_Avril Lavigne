[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Hey man, tell me, what were you thinkin'?
What the hell were you sayin'?
Oh, come on now
Stop and think about it
Hey now, maybe you should just listen
Maybe you should stop talkin'
For a second
Shut up, listen to me

[Chorus]
You're so obvious
You're so oblivious
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone
So don't apologize
You don't even realize
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Hey bro, I'm just tryna let you know
You really think that you're special?
Oh, come on now
I've seen so much better
Hey there, did you actually think that I cared?
Don't know if you want to go there
Oh, come on now
Keep on, keep on dreamin'

[Chorus]
You're so obvious
You're so oblivious
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone (Alone)
So don't apologize
You don't even realize
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone

[Bridge]
If you want to be my
Oh-oh-oh
You know you can't play games
And you know what I mean
Sorry, but you don't get my
My oh-oh-oh
I'm gone, you're still dreamin'
About me over and over and over and over again

[Chorus]
You're so obvious
You're so oblivious
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone (You're the one alone)
So don't apologize
You don't even realize
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone (Alone, alone, alone)

[Chorus]
You're so obvious (Obvious)
You're so oblivious (Oblivious)
And now you wonder why
You're the one alone (You're the one alone)
So don't apologize (Don't apologize)
You don't even realize
You screwed it up this time
Now you're the one alone

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Alone
