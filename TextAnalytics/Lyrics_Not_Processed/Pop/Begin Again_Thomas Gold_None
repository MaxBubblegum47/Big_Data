[Verse 1]
Your lips resting on my shoulder
Sharp teeth letting me know you're there
I sing out like an animal
Maybe we could meet in the middle of the night again?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you look at me
Do you see a light flash before your eyes?
Maybe we are all we need?
So I'm gonna ride until I'm by your side and I say

[Chorus]
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Maybe we could meet in the middle and begin again?
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Maybe we could meet in the middle and begin again?
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Maybe we could meet in the middle?
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Maybe we could meet in the middle and begin again?

[Verse 2]
I feel some kind of warning
In my heart like it's alive
So I call out like a prisoner
Maybe we could meet in the middle of the night again?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you look at me
Do you see a light flash before your eyes?
Maybe we are all we need?
So I'm gonna ride until I'm by your side and I say

[Chorus]
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Maybe we could meet in the middle and begin again?
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Maybe we could meet in the middle and begin again?

[Bridge]
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Maybe we could meet in the middle and begin again?

[Chorus]
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Maybe we could meet in the middle?
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Maybe we could meet in the middle and begin again?
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Maybe we could meet in the middle?
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah
Maybe we could meet in the middle and begin again?
