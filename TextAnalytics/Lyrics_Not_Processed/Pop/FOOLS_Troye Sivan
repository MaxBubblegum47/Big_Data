[Verse 1]
I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all

[Pre-Chorus]
I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children’s names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it’s my mistake

[Chorus]
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

[Verse 2]
Oh, our lives don’t collide, I’m aware of this
We've got differences and impulses and your obsession with
The little things you like stick, and I like aerosol
I don’t give a fuck, I'm not giving up, I still want it all

[Chorus]
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

[Pre-Chorus]
I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children’s names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it’s my mistake

[Chorus]
Only fools fall for you, only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

[Bridge]
Only fools fall for you (only fools)
Only fools do what I do (only fools)
Only fools fall for you (only fools)
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

[Outro]
(Only fools)
(Only fools)
(Only fools)
(Only fools)
