[Verse 1]
Wait time is the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always late
I look for you
And you look for me
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

[Bridge]
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is telling
You something that you would not like me to tell you

[Verse 2]
Wait time is to blame
Mat top frame's a trip
We all have the time
Someone's always fed
I look for you, and you look away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

[Outro: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Waking up is so much fun to do
(Tell me, don't tell me, the hard part is telling me something that you would not like me to tell you)
'80 movie make out party with you
(Tell me, don't tell me, the hard part is telling me something that you would not like me to tell you)
