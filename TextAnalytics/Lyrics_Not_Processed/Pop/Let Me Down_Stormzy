[Verse 1: Jorja Smith]
Sometimes, I wouldn't mind if I was less important
Would you think about them all the time?
Wonder if you'll even notice in the morning
So where'd you go when you can't get to me
And you just can't control?
Sometimes, I wouldn't mind if I was less important

[Chorus 1: Jorja Smith]
But I've got you to let me down
I've got you to let me down
Only you can understand why
I've got you to let me down

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Yeah, yo, it's like
You've got me, I'm pondering that
Said, "I'll be back in a sec, I need to reflect"
But you swear it's been longer than that
Time is golden, time is thin
But time is rare, so we squander and that
I feel your pain when I hear your voice
So fix your tone, man, you're stronger than that
And you're, like, the strongest girl I know
Probably the strongest, minus my mum
Don't go wasting your loving on me
When I see tears run, I'm likely to run
So girl, don't love me, I mean it
When I say I love you, I mean it
And it's mad cuh I choose to be distant
But it's fucked cuh I know what a queen is
So why do I? (Why do I?)

[Chorus 2: Jorja Smith & Stormzy]
But I've got you to let me down
Why do you let me down?
Why do you let me down, down, down?
I've got you to let me down
Sometimes, your world spins 'round
But you never had a king 'til now
Only you can understand why
Yeah, girl, do you understand
Why these feelings never come to plan?
I've got you to let me down
I'm never gonna let you down, I'm never gonna let you down

[Bridge: Jorja Smith]
Yeah, I tried, but I just can't give you up
Wonder why is it that I'm not good enough?
Some kind of hold over me

[Chorus 3: Jorja Smith & Stormzy]
I've got you to let me down
I've got you, you've got me, I've got you
But I've got you to let me down
If I let you down, will you self-destruct?
Only you, only you can understand why
Only you can understand
That I've got you to let me down
