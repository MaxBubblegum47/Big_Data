[GLINDA, spoken]
Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once?
Instead of flying off the handle!
I hope you're happy

[sung]
I hope you're happy now
I hope you're happy how you've hurt your cause forever
I hope you think you're clever

[ELPHABA, spoken]
I hope you're happy

[sung]
I hope you're happy, too
I hope you're proud how you
Would grovel in submission, to feed your own ambition

[GLINDA & ELPHABA]
So though I can't imagine how
I hope you're happy right now

[GLINDA, spoken]
Elphie, listen to me, just say you're sorry!

[sung]
You can still be with the wizard
What you've worked and waited for
You can have all you ever wanted

[ELPHABA, spoken]
I know

[sung]
But I don't want it
No, I can't want it anymore
Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by the rules
Of someone else's game
Too late for second-guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes and leap!

It's time to try defying gravity
I think I'll try defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

[GLINDA]
Can't I make you understand
You're having delusions of grandeur?

[ELPHABA]
I'm through accepting limits
'Cause someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change
But 'til I try, I'll never know!
Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love I guess I've lost
Well, if that's love
It comes at much too high a cost!

I'd sooner buy defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

[spoken]
Glinda, come with me. Think of what we could do, together!

[sung]
Unlimited
Together, we're unlimited
Together we'll be the greatest team there's ever been
Glinda, dreams the way we planned 'em

[GLINDA]
If we work in tandem

[GLINDA & ELPHABA]
There's no fight we cannot win
Just you and I, defying gravity
With you and I defying gravity

[ELPHABA]
They'll never bring us down!

[spoken]
Well, are you coming?

[GLINDA, sung]
I hope you're happy
Now that you're choosing this

[ELPHABA]
[spoken]
You, too

[sung]
I hope it brings you bliss

[GLINDA & ELPHABA]
I really hope you get it
And you don't live to regret it
I hope you're happy in the end
I hope you're happy my friend

[ELPHABA]
So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky!
As someone told me lately
"Everyone deserves the chance to fly!"
And if I'm flying solo
At least I'm flying free
To those who ground me
Take a message back from me

Tell them how I am defying gravity!
I'm flying high, defying gravity!
And soon, I'll match them in renown
And nobody in all of Oz
No wizard that there is or was
Is ever gonna bring me down!

[GLINDA]
I hope you're happy

[CITIZENS OF OZ]
Look at her! She's wicked!
Get her!

[ELPHABA]
Bring me down!

[CITIZENS OF OZ]
No one mourns the wicked!
So we've got to bring her...

[ELPHABA]
Oh!

[CITIZENS OF OZ]
...down!
