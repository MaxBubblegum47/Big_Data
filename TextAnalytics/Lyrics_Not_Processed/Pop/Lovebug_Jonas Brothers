[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Called you for the first time yesterday
Finally found the missing part of me
I felt so close, but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

[Chorus: Joe Jonas 
with Nick Jonas
]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this 
lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this 
lovebug again

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & 
Joe Jonas
]
I can't get your smile out of my mind
(I can't get you out of my mind)
I think about your eyes all the time
You're beautiful, but you don't even try
(You don't even, don't even try)
Modesty is just so hard to find

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Bridge: Joe Jonas 
with Nick Jonas
]
I kissed her for the first time yesterday
Everything I 
wished that it would be
Suddenly I 
forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless
Baby, can't you see?

[Breakdown: Joe Jonas]
Now I'm!
Yeah, oh!

[Chorus Variation: Joe Jonas]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Outro: Joe Jonas 
with Nick Jonas
]
Oh, 
lovebug again
