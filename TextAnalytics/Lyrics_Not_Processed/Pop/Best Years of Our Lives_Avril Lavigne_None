[Intro: Evan T]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Evan T]
We had the best years of our lives
But you and I would never be the same
September took me by surprise
And I was left to watch the seasons change
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Avril Lavigne]
It's been so quiet since you've gone
And every day feels more like a year
Sometimes I wish I could move on
The memories would all just disappear

[Pre-Chorus: Evan T & Avril Lavigne, Both]
So many things I should've
Said when I had the chance
So many times we took it all for granted

[Chorus: Evan T & Avril Lavigne]
I never thought this could ever end
Never thought I'd lose my best friend
Everything is different now
Can we stop the world from turning?
I never thought I'd have to let you go
Never thought I'd ever feel this low
I wish I could go back
Can we stop the world from turning?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Evan T & Avril Lavigne, Both]
Looking back on better days
When we were young, and thought we knew so much
And now it seems so far away
I'm wondering If I was good enough

[Pre-Chorus: Evan T & Avril Lavigne, Both]
So many things I should've
Said when I had the chance
So many times we took it all for granted

[Chorus: Evan T & Avril Lavigne]
I never thought we would ever end
Never thought I'd lose my best friend
Everything is different now
Can we stop the world from turning?
I never thought I'd have to let you go
Never thought I'd ever feel this low
I wish I could go back
Can we stop the world from turning?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Evan T]
Gone are all the days (Gone are all the days)
When we swore we'd never break (When we swore we'd never break)
And now I'm left here alone (Now I'm left here alone)

[Bridge: Evan T & Avril Lavigne]
Gone are all the days
Yeah, we swore we'd never change
And now I'm left here alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus: Evan T & (Avril Lavigne)]
I never thought this would ever end
Never thought I'd lose my best friend
Everything is different now
(Can we stop the world from turning?)
I never thought that this could ever end
I never thought I'd lose my best friend
Everything is different now
(Can we stop the world from turning?)
I never thought I'd have to let you go
Never thought I'd ever feel this low
I wish I could go back
Can we stop the world from turning?

[Outro: Evan T]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh
