[Chorus]
I know why you're calling me
'Cause he don't love you like you want him to
You know I hit it properly
But nobody do it like me and you

[Verse 1]
It's funny how everything changes, but still remains the same
Something like a boomerang, you're coming 'round my way
'Cause I've been hearing all these rumors
That you've been seeing someone new
But you addicted to my addiction
It's time for you to stay away, away

[Pre-Chorus]
So call the medical, can get a little dose
I got an antidote for that body
We're compatible, ain't no need to take it slow
I know, I know, I know

[Chorus]
I know why you're calling me
'Cause he don't love you like you want him to
You know I hit it properly, but nobody do it like me and you
I know what you need, girl, you know this also
So I'll leave the key up under the door
So you can come on, get on top of me
So I can fuck you like you want me to, like you want me to

[Post-Chorus]
I'm told you want it (Girl, like you want me, too)
I'm told you want it

[Verse 2]
He gives you that basic kinda loving, now all you do is complain
(I bet the neighbors don't know his name)
You know I got that boomerang so I come through late
So shout me when you coming through, right
You ain't gotta tell me what to do tonight
You're addicted to my addiction
It's time for you to stay away, away

[Pre-Chorus]
So call the medical, can get a little dose
I got an antidote for that body
We're compatible, ain't no need to take it slow
I know, I know, I know

[Chorus]
I know why you're calling me
'Cause he don't love you like you want him to
You know I hit it properly, but nobody do it like me and you
I know what you need, girl, you know the [?]
So I'll leave the key up under the door
So you can come on, get on top of me
So I can fuck you like you want me to, like you want me to

[Post-Chorus]
I'm told you want it (Girl, like you want me, too)
I'm told you want it

[Bridge]
Now I got your head up in the pillow
Girl, you can't say nothing, can't say something
I'ma have you [?]
Make you wanna sing something, wanna sing something

[Chorus]
I know why you're calling me
'Cause he don't love you like you want him to
You know I hit it properly, but nobody do it like me and you
I know what you need, girl, you know the [?]
So I'll leave the key up under the door
So you can come on, get on top of me
So I can fuck you like you want me to, like you want me to

[Post-Chorus]
I'm told you want it (Girl, like you want me, too)
I'm told you want it
