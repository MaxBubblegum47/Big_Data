[Verse]
I remember what you told me
Said I wasn't made right
Said I wasn't cut right
That's why I'm so lonely, mm
Can't turn a ho into a housewife
That I was just a homie, a fun girl
I can still be your day one girl, mm
I don't understand it
Takes me out of the categories of marriage
Is it 'cause I know what I want just like you?
'Cause I make my own money and my own moves?
Love who I want and fuck who I choose to
Don't take no shit and won't be used

[Chorus]
But I guess that makes me undesirable
Guess that makes you so attractive, oh
Guess that makes me undesirable, oh
Guess that makes you so attractive, oh yeah

[Outro]
Life's unfair
Life's unfair, life's unfair, yeah
Life's unfair, yeah-yeah
Life's so unfair
