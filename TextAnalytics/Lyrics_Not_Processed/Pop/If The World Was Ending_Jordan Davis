[Verse 1]

[H.E.R., 
Niall Horan
 & 
Keith Urban
]
I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

[Pre-Chorus]

[FINNEAS & 
Alessia Cara
]
I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

[Chorus]

[Jason Derulo, 
Kesha
, 
Zara Larsson
 & 
Alessia Cara
]
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant

[Kelsea Ballerini, 
Sam Smith
 & 
The Rose
]
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

[Anthony Ramos, 
Alessia Cara
 & 
Jason Derulo
]
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? 
Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
 
Right?

[Verse 2]

[Pink Sweat$, 
Jordan Davis
, 
Sasha Sloan
 & 
Anne-Marie
]
I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen

[Anne-Marie & 
Noah Cyrus
]
Ah, it's been a year now, 
think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

[Pre-Chorus]

[FINNEAS & 
FLETCHER
]
I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

[Chorus]

[Sabrina Carpenter, 
Sam Smith
, 
Niall Horan
 & 
Anne-Marie
]
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant

[Evaluna & Camilo, 
Sam Harris
 & 
FINNEAS
]
Si el mundo se acaba, ¿tú vendrías, verdad?
Los dos cayendo con la gravedad
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

[H.E.R. & 
Maeta
]
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
Oh, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
Right

[Pre-Chorus]

[Mau y Ricky, 
Kesha
 & 
Jason Derulo
]
Yo sé que tú sabes que amarno' de lejo' no es igual
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other
 
and it's fine

[Chorus]

But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night (
Stay the night
)
Would you love me for the hell of it?
 (
Hell of it
)
All our fears would be irrelevant

If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling while I hold you tight
 (
Oh woah

No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
Hmm
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
