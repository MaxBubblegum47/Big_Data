[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

[Verse 1]
You're so fine, I want you mine, you're so delicious
I think about you all the time, you're so addictive
Don't you know what I can do to make you feel alright?
(Alright, alright, alright, alright)
Don't pretend, I think you know I'm damn precious
And hell yeah, I'm the motherfuckin' princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I'm right
(I'm right, I'm right, I'm right, I'm right)

[Pre-Chorus]
She's like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

[Verse 2]
I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away, I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again
(Again, again, again)
(So come over here)
So come over here and tell me what I wanna hear
Better yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again
(And again, and again, and again)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she's like so whatever
And you could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that’s what everyone’s talking about

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend

[Bridge]
In a second, you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend (Hey, no way, no way)
No way, no way, I think you need a new one (Hey, no way, no way)
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend (No way, no way)

[Outro]
Hey, hey
No way
Hey, hey
No way, no way
Hey, hey
I know that you like me (No way)
You know it's not a secret (Hey, hey)
I want to be your girlfriend (No way, no way)
Hey, hey!
