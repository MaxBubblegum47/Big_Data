[Verse 1]
I'm so afraid of dying here alone
One more day, need a feeling that I know
In this space, a love that takes
I've lost my way, always been out on my own
'Til you came, oh who gave you the control?
That you take, the love we made

[Chorus]
If you say you'll be my love, don't be a liar
'Cause I been taking low, you take me higher
Ooh, higher, higher
Higher, higher
I can't stop the love we make

[Verse 2]
You brought me back to life
And now I feel like I'm alive
I can't breathe when you're by my side
Need the touch, loving takes
You make it hurt so but oh, I like
I can't stop the love we make

[Chorus]
If you say you'll be my love, don't be a liar
'Cause I been taking low, you take me higher
Ooh, higher, higher
Higher, higher
I can't stop the love we make

[Bridge]
Can we just feel it all? Make it go so right that it's wrong
We can be somewhere now tonight
Feel the heat, flame is hot, boy, you can't put the fire out
I can't stop the love we make

[Chorus]
If you say you'll be my love, don't be a liar
'Cause I been taking low, you take me higher
Ooh, higher, higher
Higher, higher
I can't stop the love we make
