[Intro]
You hold me

[Verse 1]
I don't know who you are
You say I know you like I know myself
It's all perception
Maybe I could love you like nobody else?
Let's see how far
We can take this without breaking hearts

[Pre-Chorus]
See what we're made of
So what are we afraid of?

[Chorus]
We pretend we're not falling
But you can't keep your hands off of me
You caught me without warning
You hold me, you hold me
Close enough to see right through me
And I can't take my eyes off of you
You caught me without warning
You hold me, you hold me

[Post-Chorus]
You hold me

[Verse 2]
Wanna be where you are
I'm drowning in my thoughts, I'm losing sleep
It's just perception
But I wish that you were lying next to me
And I wait for your call
Wanna run, but first we learn to crawl

[Pre-Chorus]
See what we're made of
So what are we afraid of?

[Chorus]
We pretend we're not falling
But you can't keep your hands off of me
You caught me without warning
You hold me, you hold me
Close enough to see right through me
I can't take my eyes off of you
You caught me without warning
You hold me, you hold me

[Post-Chorus]
You hold me
You hold me

[Outro]
You hold me
You hold me
