[Verse 1: Rosé,

Jisoo

Tell me where you wanna go
I'll meet you with my bags at the door
Uh, I'm gonna make you go blind
Every time I walk, my hips, they don't lie
Take me to your paradise
'Cause I don't wanna wait anymore
Uh, I'll say it one more time
Every time I walk, my hips, they don't lie

[Pre-Chorus: Jennie & 
Rosé
]
You wanna touch, wanna touch? Of course you wanna
You wanna run with my love, I know you wanna
From the club to the tub, you said you wanna
Give me an all night hug, I bet you wanna
I bet you wanna, I bet you wanna
I bet you, I bet you, I bet you wanna
I bet you wanna, I bet you wanna

[Chorus: Jennie, 
Jisoo
]
Something 'bout me's taking you higher (Hey, hey)
And you ain't evеr gonna come down (You ain't ever, you ain't еver)
I'm lighting your fire (Hey, hey)
And it ain't ever gonna go out (It ain't ever, it ain't ever)

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Cardi
Take the car keys, drive me crazy (Vroom)
Cardi a good catch, but you gotta chase me (Ha)
Grab my waistline, but don't ever waste me (Mmm)
Turn on "Please Me," but don't ever play me (No)
One of a kind, you can't replace me (Yes)
Time to shine, I bust down the AP (Bing)
The stakes is higher (Hey)
Let's do what we both desire (Hey)
On God, like I'm in the choir (Woo)
I bet you if you make me sweat, I'll still be on fire

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & 
Jennie
]
You wanna touch, wanna touch? Of course you wanna
You wanna run with my love, I know you wanna
From the club to the tub, you said you wanna
Give me an all night hug, I bet you wanna
I bet you wanna, I bet you wanna
I bet you, I bet you, I bet you wanna
I bet you wanna, I bet you wanna

[Chorus: Rosé, 
Jisoo
]
Something 'bout me's taking you higher (Hey, hey)
And you ain't ever gonna come down (You ain't ever, you ain't ever)
I'm lighting your fire (Hey, hey)
And it ain't ever gonna go out (It ain't ever, it ain't ever)

[Bridge: Jennie, 
Lisa
]
If you want me (Me), bet a bit higher
Wanna look down (Down), up in the sky, yeah
(Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher)
Boy, better pick it up so damn high
Lookin' so thick (Thick), make you desire
I'm a whole bit (Bit), keep you up higher
(Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher)

[Chorus: Jennie & Rosé, 
Jennie
, 
Jisoo
]
Something 'bout me's taking you higher (Hey, hey)
And you ain't ever
 gonna come down (You ain't ever, you ain't ever)
I'm lighting your fire
 (
Ah
)
And it ain't ever gonna go out
 (It ain't ever, it ain't ever)
Something 'bout me's
 taking you higher (
Hey
)
And you ain't ever gonna come down (You ain't ever, you ain't ever)

[Outro: Cardi B]
Bet you wanna love this, ah
