[Verse 1]
I know you're with me
And I'd love to see someone else call you
And all this in between
You think it's hard for me to tell you're fallin'
Oh, we're fallin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And bein' chill, bein' chill with you
Oh, it kills, I ain't chill at all, at all

[Chorus]
We say "I love you," but we ain't together
Do you think labels make it taste much better?
Darlin', do you think that if I talk enough
I will make you wanna be mine?
We ain't together

[Verse 2]
Cut off all these hoes (Ah)
Baby, you don't gotta worry 'bout nothing (Ah)
'Cause everybody knows (Ah)
That you and I got that somethin' (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
And bein' chill, bein' chill with you (Ah)
Oh, it kills, I ain't chill at all, at all

[Chorus]
We say "I love you," but we ain't together
Do you think labels make it taste much better?
Darlin', do you think that if I talk enough
I will make you wanna be mine?
We ain't together

[Bridge]
And I can't watch this fall apart

[Chorus]
We say "I love you," but we ain't together
Do you think labels make it taste much better?
Darlin', do you think that if I talk enough
I will make you wanna be mine?
'Til you don't say you and I ain't together, babe
Ain't together
Ain't together
