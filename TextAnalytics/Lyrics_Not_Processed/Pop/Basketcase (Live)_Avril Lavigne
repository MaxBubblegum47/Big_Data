[Verse 1]
Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

[Chorus]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid? Am I just stoned?

[Verse 2]
I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

[Chorus]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid? Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Grasping to control, so I better hold on

[Chorus]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid? Am I just stoned?

[Outro]
Basket Case, Green Day
Alright
