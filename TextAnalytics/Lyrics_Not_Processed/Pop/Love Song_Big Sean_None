[Verse 1: Suai]
Trying to write a love song
I wanted it to be just right
Tried to make it beautiful
But all I can think about is our last fight
I was gonna play it on piano
Had the drums come in real bold
But I couldn't think of anything good to say
So the big ballad strings will never get played
Pretty melody I wrote will never get sang
Piece of paper that I started with got thrown away
A song about our love will never see the light of day
Why? cause you made it that way
Yea you made it that way

[Hook:]
I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you're just
A lame who's shit out of luck
I almost wrote you a love song

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
(Crazy ass bitch)
She threw my watch out the window
Chain in her hand
She running through the crib
Finding anything she can
Our relationship is not the only thing that's out of hand
She even called my momma like
'you need to get your man
Cause your son lying on me
I ain't trying to get a tan
And this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands
So I'm heading to the club trying to find a man'
Bitch you headed to the club trying to find a man?
What is you saying?
Hoes and passionate night gowns
But you the only one I imagined in white gowns
So with your left hand you should let me add a ring to it
Since mr and mrs anderson just has a ring to it
She like 'why you act like that to me?
Then walk right back, mike jack to me?
Everytime we fall out I throw your ass out'
But you just end up boomeranging right back to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I think you crazy, crazy
You need medication
You should calm down
You need meditation
Sending me a text with a hundred exclamations
About how I'm wrong without any explanation at a ll
Before you say another nigga next up
I should call the maid down cause I messed up
I gave you what you need
Even on those shopping sprees
I would throw you paper like extra extra (read all about it)
She said 'what if we reverse roles
And you was front row cheering at my first show
And a couple dollars later and some Louis vuitton clothes
I could fuck a couple niggas thinkin that you said I know
And since I had no feelings for them then it shouldn't hurt yours
And since you thought id never do it, it even hurt more
And I would lie about it but you found out from a source
Whos word was more truthful than yours'

[Verse 4: Suai]
I'm so glad I didn't ever pen it
Now you ain't got nothing with your stupid name in it
And if I would've did it I probably would've stay with you
Listening to the lies you were constantly telling
You did me all wrong
What would even make me wanna write you a song
So glad I moved on
Cause now I gotta new guy that's turning me on
And the big ballad strings about to get played
Pretty melody I wrote about to get sang
A song about his love is gonna see the light of day
Why? cause you made it that way
Yea you made it that way

[Hook]
