[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Rob $tone
Gucci

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
Now I just smash on ‘em, press the gas on ‘em, make it hurt
Poppin’ xans up in my Squirt, I go to work, lift up my shirt
Then I just spazz on ‘em, throw my cash on ‘em, Louis shirt
Drop some bands all on this, skrt, then threw my grams right up her skirt
Now I just smash on ‘em, press the gas on ‘em, make it hurt
Poppin’ xans up in my squirt, I go to work, lift up my shirt
Then I just spazz on ‘em, throw my cash on ‘em, Louis shirt
Drop some bands all on this, skrt, then threw my grams right up her skirt

[Verse 1: Rob $tone]
Now watch me break a bag on ‘em, flip this cash on ‘em
I just swag on ‘em, bitches hate me ‘cause I always bag on ‘em
I done made so many racks had to finesse the tax on it
My new garments cost a leg and you best bet she bad homie
Turn my swag on, you niggas mad phony
Watch the gas for me, when I hop out, bet I hop out bag on me
When you pop off we gon’ pop shots and won’t break a sweat on it
And I be feeling like the man when I got fifty bands on me
Bring your friends over, girl come get this player potion
Young Rob $tone gon’ bust it down and you gon’ do your dance for me
Don’t be scared, show me, I’ma hot shot, rare homie
I’m papa player on it, I’m gon’ pop these bands up on it

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
Now I just smash on ‘em, press the gas on ‘em, make it hurt
Poppin’ xans up in my squirt, I go to work, lift up my shirt
Then I just spazz on ‘em, throw my cash on ‘em, Louis shirt
Drop some bands all on this, skrt, then threw my grams right up her skirt
Now I just smash on ‘em, press the gas on ‘em, make it hurt
Poppin’ xans up in my squirt, I go to work, lift up my shirt
Then I just spazz on ‘em, throw my cash on ‘em, Louis shirt
Drop some bands all on this, skrt, then threw my grams right up her skirt

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane and Rob $tone so get your mob on
Got on all these diamond chains but still don’t get your head blown
Call me quickdraw McGraw, I shoot you through your headphones
I’m from Zone 6 East Atlanta but call it the bread zone
When a rich nigga DM your BM, she on tour with no per diem
Guwop smash ‘em, thick or slim
Came with them but left with him
CEO got major paper, I’m a walking record label
Payola under the table, Wizzop the new Tony Draper
Innovating, real estating, bought it just to renovate it
You just a lil rental baby, you get dick for dinner baby
Come hang with the winner baby
Ice cold as the winter baby
Soon as Gucci enter all the tenders hyperventilating

[Chorus: Rob $tone]
Now I just smash on ‘em, press the gas on ‘em, make it hurt
Poppin’ xans up in my squirt, I go to work, lift up my shirt
Then I just spazz on ‘em, throw my cash on ‘em, Louis shirt
Drop some bands all on this, skrt, then threw my grams right up her skirt
Now I just smash on ‘em, press the gas on ‘em, make it hurt
Poppin’ xans up in my squirt, I go to work, lift up my shirt
Then I just spazz on ‘em, throw my cash on ‘em, Louis shirt
Drop some bands all on this, skrt, then threw my grams right up her skirt
