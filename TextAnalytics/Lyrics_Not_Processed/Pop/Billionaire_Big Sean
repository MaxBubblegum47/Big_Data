[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Soon as I walk in
Nothing but talkin'
I beg my pardon for not begging pardon
Walk in the store, close all the doors
They know I am a very big copper like the warden
Matter fact you should award him
You should support him for being so important
Shh! Do you hear the applaudin'?
Camera recording? Roll out the carpet
Back in the spotlight, parallel parkin'
And I do not have time for the jargon
I hop on records, tend to break records
G.O.O.D. Music what you think I'm signed to the best for?
I mean I ain't really trying to trip

See I'm just trying to let me money stack

So let my money stack
To a hundred stacks
Times a hundred stacks
Times a hundred that

[Verse 3: Big Sean]

Pastel? Got it
Before he even dropped it
Four chains on
Yeah I be on that Paul shit
Jesus piece too; add twenty thousand
You do not got this
You cannot afford it
You cannot stop it
Might as well support it

[Hook]
Let my money stack
To a hundred stacks
Times a hundred stacks
Times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Yeah, and times a hundred that
See I'm just trying to let me money stack
To a hundred stacks
Times a hundred stacks
Times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Yeah, times a hundred that
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, coming, keep it coming
Just trying to let me money stack
To a hundred stacks
