[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby
Come on, girl

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I fell (I fell) so fast (So fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (High heels), red dress (Red dress)
All by yourself, gotta catch my breath

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Walk in the room, all I can see is you, oh
Staring me down, I know you feel it, too

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby
Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

[Verse 3: Big Rob & (Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas)]
Yo, we're burning up in this place tonight
Your Brothers sing it loud (And we're feeling right)
Get up and dance (Don't try and fight it)
Big Rob's for real (And that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (And touch the floor)
(It keeps on burnin' up) more and more
I got JB with me (Laying it down)
Come on boys, letâ€™s bring the chorus around

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Big Rob]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under (Yeah)
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter? (Come on, man)
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

[Outro: Nick Jonas & Big Rob]
Burnin' up (Sup?), burnin' up for you, baby
