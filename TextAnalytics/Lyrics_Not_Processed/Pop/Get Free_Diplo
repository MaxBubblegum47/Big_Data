[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee give in
What can I do to get the money?
We ain’t got the money, we ain’t getting out

Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearing thin
All I need’s relief
I need, I need some sympathy, yeah

[Chorus]
Look at me
I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream (Dream, dream, dream)

[Verse 2]
All of my life been wading in
Water so deep, now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long, how long 'til we have a friend?
Coming down, feeling like a battery hen
Waves won’t break 'til the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise?
What will I do without my dreams? (Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh, hey)

[Chorus]
Look at me
I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream (Dream, dream, dream)

[Bridge]
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
(Look at me
I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be)
I know you, you know me
Baby

[Outro]
I just wanna dream
I just wanna dream
I just wanna dream
Baby, you know me
