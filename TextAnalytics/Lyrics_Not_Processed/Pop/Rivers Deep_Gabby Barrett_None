[Chorus]
Don't worry, babe, when your heart is weak
Just lay your head, lay it down on me
Baby, what we got doesn't grow on trees
This kind of love runs rivers deep
Let the floods rise up, ain't got nothing on us
This kind of love runs rivers deep
Let the flood rise up, ain't got nothing on us
This kind of love runs rivers deep
This kind of love runs rivers deep

[Verse 1]
Tryna fight the voices
Can't let 'em go
I'm tryna fight the poison, I'm down in your soul
Give me all your pain, all your wicked pain
All the prayers are broken, you ran out of hope
I'm puttin' out the fire
I'm burnin' your soul
So let the river flow, oh, so let it rise up
Rise up
Let the river rise up

[Chorus]
Don't worry, babe, when your heart is weak
Just lay your head, lay it down on me
Baby, what we got doesn't grow on trees
This kind of love runs rivers deep
Let the floods rise up, ain't got nothing on us
This kind of love runs rivers deep
Let the flood rise up, ain't got nothing on us
This kind of love runs rivers deep
This kind of love runs rivers deep

[Verse 2]
Oh, when the world is heavy
I'll carry the load
Ooh, baby, I'll protect ya whenever you go
We gon' be alright, so let it rise up, rise up
Let the river rise up, rise up, rise up
Let the river rise up

[Chorus]
Don't worry, babe, when your heart is weak
Just lay your head, lay it down on me
Baby, what we got doesn't grow on trees
This kind of love runs rivers deep
Let the floods rise up, ain't got nothing on us
This kind of love runs rivers deep
Let the flood rise up, ain't got nothing on us
This kind of love runs rivers deep
This kind of love runs rivers deep

[Bridge]
Rise up, rise up, let the river rise up
Rise up, rise up, let the river rise up
Said, rise up, rise up, let the river rise up
Rise up, rise up, let the river rise up

[Chorus]
Don't worry, babe, when your heart is weak
(Rise up, rise up, let the river rise up)
Just lay your head, lay it down on me
(Rise up, rise up, let the river rise up)
Baby, what we got doesn't grow on trees
(Rise up, rise up, let the river rise up)
This kind of love runs rivers deep
Let the floods rise up, ain't got nothing on us
This kind of love runs rivers deep
Let the flood rise up, ain't got nothing on us
This kind of love runs rivers deep
This kind of love runs rivers deep
