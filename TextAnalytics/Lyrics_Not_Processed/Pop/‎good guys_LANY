[Verse 1]
I wanna call you up
Tell you how I feel
But I might scare you away if
I get too real
So I won't text back
For a couple hours
What I really wanna do is
Bring you flowers

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not gonna hold your hand
Ask if you wanna dance
Not gonna take you home, even though

[Chorus]
I just wanna give you everythin'
Show you I'm a Southern gentleman
All I wanna do is let you in
But good guys, good guys never win
I just wanna be the one you call
Anything you need, anything at all
All I wanna do is let you in
But good guys, good guys never win

[Verse 2]
When you stay out late
And I don't hear back
I always wonder where you've been but
I don't ask
You're the one I want
I don't wanna share
But when you talk about someone else
I act like I don't care

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not gonna hold your hand
Ask if you wanna dance
Not gonna take you home, even though

[Chorus]
I just wanna give you everythin'
Show you I'm a Southern gentleman
All I wanna do is let you in
But good guys, good guys never win
I just wanna be the one you call
Anything you need, anything at all
All I wanna do is let you in
But good guys, good guys never win

[Bridge]
So I'm gonna play it cool
'Til I know you want me too
So I'm gonna play it cool
'Til I know you want me too

[Chorus]
I just wanna give you everythin'
Show you I'm a Southern gentleman
All I wanna do is let you in
But good guys, good guys never win
I just wanna be the one you call
Anything you need, anything at all
All I wanna do is let you in
But good guys, good guys never win

[Post-Chorus]
So I'm gonna play it cool
'Til I know you want me too

[Outro]
So I'm gonna play it cool
'Til I know you want me too
So I'm gonna play it cool
'Til I know you want me too
