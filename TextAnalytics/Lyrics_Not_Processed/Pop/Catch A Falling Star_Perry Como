[Chorus]
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

[Verse 1]
For love may come and tap you on the shoulder some starless night
Just in case you feel you want to hold her
You'll have a pocketful of starlight

[Chorus]
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

[Verse 1]
For love may come and tap you on the shoulder some starless night
Just in case you feel you want to hold her
You'll have a pocketful of starlight
(Pocketful of starlight, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm)

[Chorus]
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

[Hook]
(Save it for a rainy, save it for a rainy, rainy, rainy, day)

[Bridge]
For when your troubles start multiplying and they just might
It's easy to forget them without trying
With just a pocketful of starlight

[Chorus]
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day
