[Pre-Chorus]
Such precious cargo you took for granted
Let my heart follow you, now it's stranded, still
If hearts fell from the sky you still wouldn't find
Another like mine

[Chorus]
You had your chance
At something beautiful
A love like mine
Is so unusual

[Post-Chorus]
Something so real, something so real, something so real
Something so real

[Verse]
Yeah, today's your birthday
And I used to make a thing about it
I'd even spin you 'round the parking lot and sing about it
You'd get embarrassed and I'd tell you
Shit, I would go to hell with you and back
So what's the parking lot for now
Let 'em look at what we have
I guess I said too much, I shouldn't have opened up
Shit, who am I playing? I'm a lover, I was born to love
I even got my heart tatted on my sleeve
You can search the whole world but I promise
You won't ever find another me

[Pre-Chorus]
Such precious cargo you took for granted
Let my heart follow you, now it's stranded, still
If hearts fell from the sky you'd never find
Another like mine

[Chorus]
You had your chance
At something beautiful
A love like mine
Is so unusual

[Outro]
You'll never ever find something so real (you had your chance)
Something so real, won't ever get me back (at something beautiful)
Never ever find something so real (a love like mine)
No matter how long you look (it's so unusual)
You'll never ever find something so real
Something so real, something so real
You'll never ever find something so real
Something so real, something so real
You'll never ever find something so real
Something so real, something so real
You'll never ever find something so real
No matter how long you look
