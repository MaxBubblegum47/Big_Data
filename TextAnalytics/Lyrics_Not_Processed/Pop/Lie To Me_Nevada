[Verse 1: Mopiano & 
ORKID
]
Lovin' the feelin' of gettin' the pain, yeah, whoa, uh, yeah
You're stuck in the motions, I give you the space, uh-huh
You pullin' my arm and you don't wanna stay, oh (
Don't wanna stay
)
I see no color, this place is the same, place is the same

[Pre-Chorus: Mopiano & 
ORKID
]
Oh oh oh
 (Uh)
I like how it burnin', you know how we get it right
Oh oh oh
You stuck on the feeling, you're searchin' for me, yeah
Oh oh oh
You light up this place, your ignition is recognized (
Recognized
)
Oh oh oh
Tell me, now who do you want me to be?

[Chorus: Mopiano & ORKID]
When it's cool, just know it hurts to be next to you
'Cause you hide of pain of words
I want you to lie to me (Lie to me, lie to me, lie to me)
You were never meant to burn, don't need gasoline (Lie to me, lie to me, lie to me)
Now my heart will never know
I want you to lie to me

[Post-Chorus: ORKID & 
Mopiano
]
I want you to lie to me
Lie to me, lie to me, lie to me, yeah
I want you to lie to me

[Verse 2: Mopiano & 
ORKID
]
Hatin' the feeling of gettin' the pain
I hold the aces and you hold the king, uh huh
You look in my eyes, I surrender to stay (
I wanna stay
)
I need you right now, don't wanna be solo

[Pre-Chorus: Mopiano, 
with ORKID
]
Oh oh oh
 (Huh)
You light up this place, your ignition is recognized, yeah
Oh oh oh
Tell me, now who do you want me to be?

[Chorus: Mopiano & ORKID]
When it's cool, just know it hurts to be next to you
'Cause you hide of pain of words
I want you to lie to me
You were never meant to burn, don't need gasoline
Now my heart will never know
I want you to lie to me
