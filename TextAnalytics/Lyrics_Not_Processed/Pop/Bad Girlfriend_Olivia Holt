[Verse 1]
I think you've slept here one too many times
'Cause I see something changing in your eyes
I got too used to kissing you goodnight
Feels like I woke up in a bed of lies

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep callin'
Callin', callin', callin', callin'
And I think you've been fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'
But you deserve a warning

[Chorus]
I'm a bad girlfriend
I don't do holding hands
I'm no good with parents, no
I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm no good with romance
But I'd try anything for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
Anything for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
Anything for you
I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm no good with romance
But I'd try anything for you

[Verse 2]
I think I took you home too many nights
'Cause I just like waking up by your side
Did I hold you a little too tight?
It's 'cause there's something here that's feeling right

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep callin'
Callin', callin', callin', callin'
And I think you've been fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'
But you deserve a warning

[Chorus]
I'm a bad girlfriend
I don't do holding hands
I'm no good with parents, no
I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm no good with romance
But I'd try anything for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
Anything for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
Anything for you
I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm no good with romance
But I'd try anything for you

[Bridge]
Oh, mark my words, baby, let's try it
I'll make it work, won't even fight it
'Cause you ain't the only one fallin'
But you deserve a warning

[Chorus]
I'm a bad girlfriend
I don't do holding hands
I'm no good with parents, no
I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm no good with romance
But I'd try anything for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
Anything for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
Anything for you
I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm no good with romance
But I'd try anything for you
