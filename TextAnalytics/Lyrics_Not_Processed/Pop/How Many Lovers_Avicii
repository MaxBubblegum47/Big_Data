[Verse 1]
How many lovers can one man do?
Too many numbers, how 'bout you?
Sure hard to handle if more than two
Soon as you lock eyes, then you're screwed
But I go and say too much
I don't pay no mind enough

[Chorus]
I may be a bastard in your eyes
But I ain't fucking with all of those lies
Forever alone, I pay the price
Cause I ain't fucking with all of those lies
But I don't mind, waste your time
All of your beating is feeding me mine
Forever alone, I pay the price
Cause I ain't fucking with all of those lies

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Everyone looking for something true
Someone to love and be loved by too
Hard to get old when love is new
Never can tell what the love will do
But I go and say too much
I don't pay no mind enough

[Chorus]
I may be a bastard in your eyes
But I ain't fucking with all of those lies
Forever alone, I pay the price
Cause I ain't fucking with all of those lies
But I don't mind, waste your time
All of your beating is feeding me mine
Forever alone, I pay the price
Cause I ain't fucking with all of those, all of those, all of those lies

[Instrumental Outro]
