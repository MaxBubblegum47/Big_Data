[Verse]
Why'd you have to leave, why'd you have to go?
Why you never call I'll never know
Don't you know these scars never, ever healed
Ooh, since you said goodbye
Underneath the smile that I like to wear
I am still a mess, you're unaware
And I just play the fool while you play around
Ooh, since you said goodbye

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to cut me off, my dear?
Why'd you have to poof and disappear?
All that's left for me is memories
A broken heart and Hennessy
