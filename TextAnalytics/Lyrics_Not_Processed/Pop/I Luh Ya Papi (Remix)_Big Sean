[Refrain: Jennifer Lopez]
I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you're all out loving that JLove, true

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Hold up, I can get you fun up
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun up
I'ma tie my hair up top
Put a pin in it, now I'm ready, let it rock
Keep it number one, that's easy mathematics
Keep it number one, baby, ain't no static
Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at these legs
No brakes, go green, no red
If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head
Put it on you, I'ma need about 4-5 beds
'Cause I love my papi

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you, and I need you now
Ain't had none like you in a while

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi

[Refrain: Jennifer Lopez]
I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you're all out loving that JLove, true

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopes]
All day, 24 hour
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drive it how you want, I ain't tryna count mileage
I'm loving me some you
Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof
'Cause I love my papi

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you, and I need you now
Ain't had none like you in a while

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Big Sean]
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi (Uh)
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi (B.I.G. Sean Don)
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Do you love me? Do you swear?
Am I still the one? Even when I'm not there (Woah)
'Cause you know how it go and go
When you wanna go and go
Have you seen what's her face? (Who?)
Is her number in your phone?
And your answer's yes and yes
But you still say no and no
Even though I know you know
I know I know you know I know
You know? It sound dumb-de-dumb-dumb
They say what we want's wrong, fuck it
Least know what we want
And it sucks to see you cry
Know a brokenhearted girl could make the whole world drown (Drown)
And even though your makeup smears
Man I'm the one that's been the clown, why the fuck we around?
'Cause girl, you know I got that jaw drop shit (Yeah)
Plus I know your insecurities, that mall cop shit (Oh God)
I give you that screwface shit (Freaky)
Bring the ugly side out, two-faced shit (Woah)
Tryin' all new ways shit (Mmmhmm)
One night turn into a few days shit (JLo)

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez & Big Sean]
I think I love just who you are (Hahaha, yup)
We haven't grown apart, this is just the start
Where life begin, all the way to the end (Oh, yup)
And we started as friends, boy, I do love (JLo, Sean Don)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi

I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
