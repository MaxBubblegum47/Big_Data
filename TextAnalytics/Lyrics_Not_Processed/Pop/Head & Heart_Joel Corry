[Intro]
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

[Verse 1]
Oh my god, oh my god, this feeling's just begun
Saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my god, oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop

[Chorus]
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

[Verse 2]
Oooh, oh my god, oh my god, can't believe what I've become
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think, singing songs I've never sung
Oh my god, oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough ('Cause my heart)
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop

[Chorus]
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum (Mmm)
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

[Bridge]
My head and my heart
My head and my heart
I can't tell them apart
My head tells me to run, but I can't

[Chorus]
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum (Oh-oh-ooh)
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum (My heart goes)
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum (Oh-ooh)

[Outro]
Oh my god, oh my god, this feeling's just begun
Saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my god, oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
But my heart goes
