One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Ruby, Ruby, where you been so long?
Done took to drinkin' whiskey
Baby, since you been gone
Ain't no one I know, do it good as you
Lickin' on that lickin' stick the way you do

[Pre-Chorus]
You got the lips to make a strong man weak
And a heathen pray
You do it different, ain't the way you speak
No, that's just the way

[Chorus]
You go down
, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Mary, Mary, you're the one for me
And the way you hum, sting me like a bumble bee (zzz)
I'll be around to see you about, about half past ten
Ain't felt this good since, I don't know when

[Pre-Chorus]
You got the touch that I need so much
In your finger tips
I got the honey that you love to taste
On those lovely lips
So...

[Chorus]
You go down
, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Ooh baby, rub it on
Oh, it's sticky and it's sweet
And it's, it's been so long
Ain't no else got a touch like you
I let you doing things to me I let no other woman do
Ooh, it feels good
Oh feels good
Oh yeah
Oh, you do it like you should
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah, yeah
I love you so much
Make me so glad I'm a man

[Chorus]
You go down
, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down
You go down
, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down
You go down
, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down
