[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
I'm falling to pieces
But I need this
Yeah I need this
You're my fault, my weakness
When did you turn so cold
You cut me down to the bone
Now you're dancing all over my soul
I'm falling to pieces
To pieces
To pieces

[Hook: Bebe Rexha]
But I still stay
Cause your the only thing I know
So won't you take oh
Oh won't you take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me
Take me home

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
Round in circles here we go
With the highest highs
And the lowest lows
But no one shakes me like you do
My best mistake was you
And you're my sweet affliction
Cause you hurt me right
But you do it nice
Round in circles here we go
Yeah

[Hook: Bebe Rexha]
But I still stay
Cause your the only thing I know
So won't you take oh
Oh won't you take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me
Take me home

I still stay, oh
Won't you take me home
