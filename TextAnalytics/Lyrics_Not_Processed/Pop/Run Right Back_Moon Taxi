Meet me in the middle
You know I need you close
Over this highway
It's the little
Things I seem to miss the most
Oh is that you out walking
Or do I see a ghost
Am I dreaming
Am I wishing
Or just a little bit of both
'Cuz I run right back
From Carolina
And I run right back
From New Orleans
'Cuz I can't forget
The times I held you
And all those songs you sang with me
And all those songs you sang with me
I've been down through the valley
Alleyways and Boulevards
Oh but I would go forever
Just to get to where you are
And we all have our stories
And we all made it through
Oh but I don't know if I
Would have made it without you
Oh but I don't know if I
Would have made it without you
Yeah I run right back
From Carolina
And I run right back
From New Orleans
'Cuz I can't forget
The times I held you
And all those songs you sang to me
Yeah I run right back from Carolina
And I run right back
From New Orleans
'Cuz I can't forget the times I held you
And all those songs you sang with me
We all have our stories
We all made it through
Oh but I don't know if I
Would have made it without you
Oh but I don't know if I
Would have made it without you
Yeah I run right back
From Carolina
And I run right back
To Tennessee
'Cuz I can't forget
The times I held you
And all those songs you sang with me
