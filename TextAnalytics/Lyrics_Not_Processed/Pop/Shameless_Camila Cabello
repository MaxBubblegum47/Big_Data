[Verse 1]
Don't speak, no, don't try
It's been a secret for the longest time
Don't run (Oh), no, don't hide
Been running from it for the longest time

[Pre-Chorus]
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now

[Verse 2]
So we're there, now it's real
Now that you have me, do you want me still?
My kisses are history, they go back a long time, uh
And I'm tired of loving somebody that's not mine, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (Mind)

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now

[Bridge]
Distance, inches in between us
I want you to give in, I want you to give in, oh
Weakness, tension in between us
I just wanna give in
And I don't care if I'm forgiven

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
I need you more than I want to

[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
