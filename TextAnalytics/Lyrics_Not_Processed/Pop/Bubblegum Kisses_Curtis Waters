[Chorus]
Poppin' pillies in your room
Just talking Zoloft, Lexi too
We're scared we'll both be 20 soon
And someday maybe 30 too
I was born in '99, but raised by blink-182
We're so punk and we're so cool
I'm so drunk when I'm with you
Summertime, summertime
Grab som friends and grab some wine
On my mind, on my mind
Leaving, ain't got much time
Me and I, out the country
Out of state and out of mind
Growing up, make it right
Growing up, make it right

[Verse]
Summertime, coolin' with all my friends
In and out of love like "Not again"
Moving out the planet two months at the end
To another planet my mama will send
Yeah I love my mama, I will not pretend
If you fuck with the gang, you'll be in a den
Yeah we gon fight, like ryu and ken
I might just swing both ways like I'm into men
Bubblegum kisses

[Bridge]
High on shrooms in your room
I wanna go to prom with you
I wanna take a dance with you
I wanna fly you to the moon
I wanna take you to the moon
Go to prom with you
Would you go to promâ€“

[Chorus]
Poppin' pillies in your room
Just talking Zoloft, Lexi too
We're scared we'll both be 20 soon
And someday maybe 30 too
I was born in '99, but raised by blink-182
We're so punk and we're so cool
I'm so drunk when I'm with you

[Refrain]
I'm on shrooms in your room and we're bumping MF Doom
High on shrooms in your room and we're flying to the moon
Shrooms in your room and we're bumping MF Doom
High on shrooms in your room, I think I'm in love with you

[Outro]
It's the end of us
It's the end of us
It's the end of us
It's the end of us
It's the end of us
It's the end of us
It's the end of us
It's the end of us
