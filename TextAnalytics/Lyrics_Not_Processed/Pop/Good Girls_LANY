[Verse 1]
Dancing on the line of a dangerous love
You could break me overnight
But there's no one like us
Insatiably insane
Equally exchanged

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Dancing in the light of a canyon sun
Racing every wave
Going north on the one
The promises we made
I still haven't changed

[Chorus]
Baby, come back, I know my way around your heart
Don't start thinking
Things have kinda changed
They're different from what they are
You know better
That nothing is better than what we built together at home
You can find me
Back in California and sleeping with all the lights on
Won't you come and turn them out?
Come and turn them out
Come and turn them out
Come and turn them out

[Verse 2]
Making more than love on the west side of town
You could draw a line from the top to the ground
I'm selfless, drunk on you
What more could I do?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Throw it all away 'cause you do what you want
You took a little time, let 'em talk to you too much
Good girls don't exist
But I expected more than this

[Chorus]
Baby, come back, I know my way around your heart
Don't start thinking
Things have kinda changed
They're different from what they are
You know better
That nothing is better than what we built together at home
You can find me
Back in California and sleeping with all the lights on
Won't you come and turn them out?
Come and turn them out
Come and turn them out
Come and turn them out

[Bridge]
Oooooh, ooooh
Oooooh, ooooh

[Chorus]
Baby, come back, I know my way around your heart
Don't start thinking
Things have kinda changed
They're different from what they are
You know better
That nothing is better than what we built together at home
You can find me
Back in California and sleeping with all the lights on
Won't you come and turn them out?
Come and turn them out
Come and turn them out
Come and turn them out
Come and turn them out
