[Verse 1]
Saw ya in the front row
Movin' to the beat
Just movin' and groovin'
Killed me when I saw
The wet patch on your seat
Was it Coca Cola?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh baby, I hope you liked the show
When the band said goodnight
I had to say hello

[Chorus]
Little lover, I can't get you off my mind, no
Little lover, I've been trying hard to find
Someone like you

[Verse 2]
Ooh baby, you sure looked sweet
Cruisin'
A leg either side of my motorcycle seat
Just oozin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Could have been a nightmare
Could have been a dream
But on the way home, baby
I thought I heard you scream

[Chorus]
Little lover, I can't get you off my mind
Little lover, ooh, I've tried so hard to find
Someone to give me the things that [I] need, ow!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Little lover, I can't get you off my mind, no
Little lover, I've been trying hard to find
Someone like you

[Verse 3]
You had my picture on your bedroom wall
Next to Gary Glitter, yeah
I was standing on the stage playing rock 'n' roll
I was a guitar picker, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Never had a record
Never had a hit
Ooh baby, you didn't mind a bit

[Chorus]
Little lover, I can't get you off my mind, no
Little lover, I've been trying hard to find
Someone like you

[Outro]
Baby I know you're a...

Little lover
Ooh
