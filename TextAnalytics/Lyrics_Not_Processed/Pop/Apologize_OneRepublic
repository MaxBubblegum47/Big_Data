[Verse 1]
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say, but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me, then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around
And say (That)

[Chorus]
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
Too late, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat, but it's nothing new
Yeah, yeah
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry like the angel Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

[Chorus]
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late, oh, oh
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah

[Outro]
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
