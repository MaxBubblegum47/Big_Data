Emotions
What are you doing?
Oh, don't you know
Don't you know you'll be my ruin?
You've got me crying, crying again
When will you let this heartache end?

Emotions
You get me upset
Why make me remember, what I wanna forget?
I've been lonely, lonely too long
Emotions, please leave me alone

You worry my days
Yes, you torture my nights
Never a dream
No, those dreams never turn out right

Emotions
Ah, give me a break
Let me forget that I made a mistake
Oh, can't you see, what you're doing to me?
Emotions, please set me free

You worry my days
Oh, you torture my nights
Never a dream
No, those dreams never turn out right

Emotions
Ah, give me a break
Oh, let me forget that I made a mistake
Oh, can't you see what you're doing to me?
Emotions, please set me free
