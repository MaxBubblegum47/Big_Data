[Verse 1: Danielle]
Some things are long forgotten
Some things were never said
We were on one endless road
But I had a wandering heart

[Verse 2: Danielle & Este & Alana]
I said we were opposite lovers
Said it from the beginning
You kept trying to prove me wrong
Said you’d always see it through
And I know that I ran you down
So you ran away with your heart

[Chorus]
But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

[Verse 3: Danielle]
I know it’s hard to hear it
And it may never be enough
But don’t take it out on me now
'Cause I blame it all on myself

[Verse 4: Danielle & Este & Alana]
And I had a fear of forgiveness
Said it from the beginning
I was too proud to say I was wrong
Said you’d always see me through
All that time is gone, no more fearing control
I’m ready for the both of us now

[Chorus]
So just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
(Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you back
(Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
(Just know that I want you back, baby)

[Bridge: Alana]
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you

[Chorus]
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
(Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you back
(Just know that I want you)
Just know that I want you
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
(Just know that I want you back, baby)
(Just know that I want you)
(Just know that I want you back, baby)
I’ll take the fall and the fault in us
I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
