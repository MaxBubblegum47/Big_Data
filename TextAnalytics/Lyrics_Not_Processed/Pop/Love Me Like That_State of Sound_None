[Verse 1]
Devil's eye
Burning fire bringing me to life
She's the night
Got me burning on a primitive state of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't wait until you get me out of here tonight
We're gonna party like in '99
Everybody's stayin', we'll be leavin', we don't need 'em
Gettin' high all alone at night
Got me flippin', we'll be trippin' as we're sippin'
I'll be drippin' 'til we're out on the other side
And you whisper, gonna take you to a place
Where we can be alone and live like we never die

[Chorus]
When you love me like that
Cause when you love me like that
I know I'll never go back
When you love me like that

[Verse 2]
Let's get out
Say no more, I read between the lines
You and I
We communicate with chemistry, need no sound

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't wait until you get me out of here tonight
We're gonna party like in '99
Everybody's stayin', we'll be leavin', we don't need 'em
Gettin' high all alone at night
Got me flippin', we'll be trippin' as we're sippin'
I'll be drippin' 'til we're out on the other side
And you whisper, gonna take you to a place
Where we can be alone and live like we never die

[Chorus]
When you love me like that
Cause when you love me like that
I know I'll never go back
When you love me like that
Love me like that

[Verse 3]
Summer nights
And we are never runnin' out of light
You and I
This desire bringing everything into life

[Chorus]
When you love me like that
Cause when you love me like that
I know I'll never go back
When you love me like that
When you love me like that
I can't wait until you get me out of here tonight
We're gonna party like in '99
When you love me like that
Everybody's stayin', we'll be leavin', we don't need 'em
Gettin' high all alone at night
I know I'll never go back
Got me flippin', we'll be trippin' as we're sippin'
I'll be drippin' 'til we're out on the other side
When you love me like that
And you whisper, gonna take you to a place
Where we can be alone
When you love me like that
When you love me like that
When you love me like that
