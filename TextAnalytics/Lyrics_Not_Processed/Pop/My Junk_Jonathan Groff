[WENDLA]
In the midst of this nothing, this mess of a life
Still, there's this one thing: just to see you go by

[MARTHA]
It's almost like lovin', sad as that is

[THEA]
May not be cool, but it's so where I live

[ANNA]
It's like I'm your lover, or more like your ghost
—
I spend the day wonderin' what you do, where you go

[THEA]
I try and just kick it, but then what can I do?
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you

[GIRLS]
See us winter walking after a storm
It's chill in the wind, but it's warm in your arms
We stop, all snow-blind
May not be true
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you

[GEORG]
Well, you'll have to excuse me, I know it's so off
I love when you do stuff that's rude and so wrong

[HANSCHEN]
I go up to my room, turn the stereo on
Shoot up some you in the "you" of some song

[THEA]
I lie back, just driftin'
And play out these scenes
I ride on the rush
All the hopes, all the dreams
 

[ANNA]
I may be neglectin' the things I should do
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you

[ALL]
I lie back, driftin'
These scenes
The rush
The dreams...
 
We've all got our junk
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[ALL]
See, we still keep talkin' after you're gone
You're still with me then, feels so good in my arms
They say you go blind
Maybe it's true
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you...
Oh, it's like we stop time
What can I do?
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you
My junk is you
You, you, you
