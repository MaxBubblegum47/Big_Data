[Verse 1]
It feels like everybody told me so
But I couldn't believe it at all
You know I told you I'd be leaving
If you're hurting me, I see what they saw

[Pre-Chorus]
But you don't wanna let me go
You don't wanna let me go
Nobody, nobody knows how it is
But I gotta let you go
I already know
'Cause baby truth been told by him

[Chorus]
So by tomorrow I, I, I'll be gone
You won't see my face no more, oh no no
'Cause I have had enough, yeah that's for sure
You won't see my face no more, oh no no no
That's how it feels, that's how it burns
I hope that you learn, I hope that you learn
'Cause by tomorrow I, I, I'll be gone
You won't see my face no more, oh no no no, not you

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna talk about it, hear about it
Some things you should leave 'em unsaid
It's like you got no heart, no soul
'Cause baby you still try'na mess with my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you don't wanna let me go
You don't wanna let me go
Nobody, nobody knows how it is
But I gotta let you go
I already know
'Cause baby truth been told by him

[Chorus]
So by tomorrow I, I, I'll be gone
You won't see my face no more, oh no no
'Cause I have had enough, yeah that's for sure
You won't see my face no more, oh no no no
That's how it feels, that's how it burns
I hope that you learn, I hope that you learn
'Cause by tomorrow I, I, I'll be gone
You won't see my face no more, oh no no no

[Bridge]
Go, I hope that you hear what I say
I don't need your sorry
And before what you did
Could've been a different story
That's how it feels, that's how it burns
I hope that you learn, I hope that you learn
'Cause by tomorrow I, I, I'll be gone
You won't see my face no more

[Chorus]
So by tomorrow I, I, I'll be gone
You won't see my face no more, oh no no
'Cause I have had enough, yeah that's for sure
You won't see my face no more, oh no no no
That's how it feels, that's how it burns
I hope that you learn, I hope that you learn
'Cause by tomorrow I, I, I'll be gone
You won't see my face no more, oh no no no, not you
Not you, not you
