[Verse:]
Came to my place last night
For a glass of the only wine I like
And everything about you cried out
That everyone around you right now
Can't see what it is that you need
Can't see what it is that you see
In me, in me
Can't see what it is you see in me

[Chorus:]
And everyone's talking now
Everyone's talking
Everyone's got their own
Words of unpaid advice
Everyone else knows how
Everyone's talking
How it could be right this time
But could it be right this time?

[Verse:]
I'm back from my trip out to sea
With a story and more
We could be so close
Tide on a coast
Tied like the soul of a mind to a ghost
I've got too many things on the line
To lose what I know I could find
I see something in you
And I can tell that you do too

[Chorus:]
But everyone's talking now
Everyone's talking
Everyone's got their own
Words of unpaid advice
Everyone else knows how
Everyone's talking
How it could be right this time
But could it be right this time?
(Ah, ah)

[Bridge:]
What do they know?
What do they know?
What do they know?
Tell me, what do they know?
What do they know?
What do they know?
Tell me, what do they know?
What do they know?
Tell me, what do they know?
What do they know?
Tell me, what do they know?
What do they know?
Tell me, what do they know?
What do they know?
What do they know?
Tell me, what do they know?

[Chorus:]
And everyone's talking now
Everyone's talking
Everyone's got their own
Words of unpaid advice
Everyone else knows how
Everyone's talking
How it could be right this time
But could it be right this time, ah?
