[Verse 1]
I was like - excuse me and my awkward approach
I just, noticed you were running out of rum in your coke
And I was hoping I could interest you in witty reppore
And if you're game we could kick it like your keeping the score
You're, so exotic in all of the right ways
Eyes like green diamonds, skin a Milan beige
Hair's a blackcurrant that matches your style great
With a jacket you bought from Urban and your pretty bird chain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She said I look mixed
I said, "I'm dark white."
She said I seem fun, I said you damn right
Then she laughed and said Allegra's the name
And I've been waiting for a guy like you all day

[Chorus]
So, hey, we don't really got another place to go
And I know you don't wanna sleep alone so take me home tonight
So I hit her with a, oh, I know we don't got a better place to be
Tomorrow doesn't mean a thing to me, so take me home tonight

[Verse 2]
She's 24, from New York said she misses the cold
And 5'9", Gemini, favorite color is gold
I finished school back in June, studied fashion at FIDM
And yeah, she had a boyfriend but she's not longer with him
And I'm like, bartender, think we'll need another round
Girl it's early now and later we can move about the town
I'm bad at science but the chemistry's clear
That's a little joke, really though, I'm being sincere

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So maybe we could take a little ride
Let your stresses be irrelevant tonight
She's like, I know you're trouble but we're one in the same
And I've been looking for a guy like you all day

[Chorus]
So, hey, we don't really got another place to go
And I know you don't wanna sleep alone so take me home tonight
So I hit her with a, oh, I know we don't got a better place to be
Tomorrow doesn't mean a thing to me, so take me home tonight

[Bridge]
Girl all I need is some release
Oh, take me home tonight
Don't need no sleep between your sheets
Girl, just take me home tonight
Girl all I need is some release
Oh, take me home tonight
Don't need no sleep between your sheets
Girl, just take me home tonight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe we could take a little ride
Let your stresses be irrelevant tonight
I know you're trouble but we're one in the same
And I've been looking for a girl like you all day

[Chorus]
So, hey, we don't really got another place to go
And I know you don't wanna sleep alone so take me home tonight
So I hit her with a, oh, I know we don't got a better place to be
Tomorrow doesn't mean a thing to me, so take me home tonight
(Girl all I need is some release)
Hey, we don't really got another place to go
(Oh, take me home tonight)
And I know you don't wanna sleep alone so take me home tonight
(We don't need no sleep between your sheets)
So I hit her with a, oh, I know we don't got a better place to be
(Girl, just take me home tonight)
Tomorrow doesn't mean a thing to me, so take me home tonight

[Outro]
Girl all I need is some release
Oh, take me home tonight
Don't need no sleep
