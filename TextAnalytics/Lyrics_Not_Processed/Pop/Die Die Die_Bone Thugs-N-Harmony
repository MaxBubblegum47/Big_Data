[Bizzy]
Willing and ready to ride

[Krayzie Bone]
Pop pop, droppin' them niggas with the Glock gun
Nigga, you best start run, duckin' the shotgun
Leavin' 'em up off my block stunned
One eighty seven lesson and we done told ya
You fuckin' with Bone you better believe we livin' like soldiers
We lovin' that thugsta shit so nigga just throw your pumps in the air
Then you pump pump put one in a coppa like ya just don't care
You don't wanna fuck with you don't wanna buck with a realer nigga
Better check my manuscript
Drugdealer, killa, cabbage peeler
Thug with Lil' Ripsta number one with the gun come come get some
Senseless killa Fifth Dog and posse run get gone
Follow the Bone,my niggas strong leave 'em alone,trip, it be on
Creep up on one & you gone
And nigga be thinkin' I'm wrong so go on
Cause nigga the sawed-off ain't full of shit
Me lovin' to smoke tweed and me weed man
They givin' me what me need man when I light my blunt
Fold the niggas up in me hood so when we smoke smoke smoke
Get paid good so we gonna blaze good
So come to The Land where all the thugs be real
Them St. Claire niggas they ain't no joke
So catch a slug or chill nigga

[Chorus]
[Bizzy Bone]
I'm lil' ripsta, im...
[Krayzie Bone]
Leather face comin' to kill them at night
[Bizzy]
Die Die Die
[Krayzie]
So must we buck them studio thugstas I'm...
[Bizzy]
Willing and ready to ride

[Cop]
Lie down with your hands behind your back
[Gun being cocked]
[Bizzy Bone]
Naw bitch you lie your funky ass on the ground..now
[News Reporter]
This seemingly routine investigation
Had become a horrible nightmare..

[Bizzy]
Running with gats and bats
So nigga don't test rest or you get a peeled cap
Pap pap that pump better check that gun
For a nigga done get that skull cracked
Lil' Rip done rolled up
The bigger the nigga the quicker get showed up
Let's swerve to the burbs set up a hold up
So many bodies me blowed up
Nuts bucks and guts nigga mistakin' them balls for dogs
All niggas'll get mauled no thang to pick up a pole & flip on all y'all
And I never hoe’d out, especially when I’m rose’d out
Bet I bringin' in them guns run a thug get low down
You don't wanna get nutted cause' nigga you gonna get bloody
Once you see the braids and skully
Cuttin' that throat when I'm rippin' up somethin' lovely
What is it in ya? deep in the dead when we get fried
POD when I comes to ride
Creep but you sleep and then fall in the night
Once inside forgettin' about remorse your curse will ride
Cry now when you're ready to lie down
When I'm weak in a mental state
Somebody gonna die now

Meanwhile swerve to the burbs

[Witness 1]
Man he just all of a sudden just jumped out of a window
I didn't know what was goin' on I'm just walkin' by
Just got a bottle of wine..
I was just walkin' by
And all I seen was him jump when that lady yelled
(And that was it.) I don't know?
[Witness 2]
Well I saw his wife begging him
And she said "don't jump" and he did
[Reporter 2]
Did you know the guy?
[Witness 3]
He sure had a problem
That's all I could tell ya
[Witness 4]
All I seen was them put the lady in a police car
And take her I guess it was his wife
