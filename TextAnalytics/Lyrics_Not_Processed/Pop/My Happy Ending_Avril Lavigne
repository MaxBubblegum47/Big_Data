[Intro]
Oh, oh, (So much for my happy ending) oh, oh
Oh, oh, (So much for my happy ending) oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread (Breakable thread)

[Pre-Chorus]
You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

[Chorus]
You were everything, everything that I wanted (That I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it (We lost it)
All of the memories so close to me just fade away
All this time, you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh) So much for my happy ending (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say (I know what they say)
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they (But so are they)
But they don't know me
Do they even know you? (Even know you)
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do (All the shit that you do)

[Pre-Chorus]
You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

[Chorus]
You were everything, everything that I wanted (That I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it (We lost it)
And all of the memories so close to me just fade away
All this time, you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

[Bridge]
It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done

[Chorus]
He was everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
And all of the memories so close to me just fade away
All this time, you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

[Chorus]
You were everything, everything that I wanted (That I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it (We lost it)
And all of the memories so close to me just fade away
All this time, you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh) So much for my happy ending (Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh) So much for my happy ending (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
