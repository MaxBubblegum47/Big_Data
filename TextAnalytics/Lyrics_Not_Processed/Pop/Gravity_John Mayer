[Chorus]
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

[Verse 1]
Oh, I'll never know
What makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

[Chorus]
Woah, woah
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

[Verse 2]
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

[Guitar Solo]

[Repeat Verse 2]
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

[Chorus]
Woah, woah
Gravity, stay the hell away from me
Woah, woah
Gravity has taken better men than me
Now, how can that be?

[Outro]
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where, now, keep me where the light is
