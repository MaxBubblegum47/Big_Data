When a child wakes up on an ordinary day
He dresses himself and he gathers his bag
And his parents wave him on his way
When he sees his friends and they have so much to say
But their classes are starting and there
Should be time to catch up later on that day
So they say their goodbyes and go on their way
As they usually do everyday

When they take their seats on an ordinary day
How could anyone know they'd be quickly
Erased and their lives would be taken away?

Over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again
How many bodies do we have to bleed
To keep this from happening again?

When a man wakes up on an ordinary day
He kisses his wife as she puts on her
Shoes knowing all the while she'd rather stay
So he leaves the house, a little earlier today
To stop by her office and kiss her again
'cause he knows it will brighten her day
So they say their goodbyes and go on their way
As they usually do everyday

When he gets to school on an ordinary day
How could anyone know he'd be quickly
Erased and his life would be taken away?

Over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again
How many bodies do we have to bleed
To keep this from happening again?

Mothers and fathers and brothers and
Sisters and friends we will never see again
How many families have broken apart
For a system protected by men?
When did a gun matter more than the
Life of a child, a family, a friend?
How can we start, after all that we've lost, to mend?

Over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again
How many bodies do we have to bleed
How many bodies do we have to bleed
How many bodies do we have to bleed
To keep this from happening again?
