[Verse 1: Wulf]
We were in love with the sun
We were in love with the sun, sippin' on coke and rum
Way head up in the clouds but when I look back now
Ain't nothing else I would do
When I spend the summer on you

[Verse 2: Wulf]
Our troubles all under rocks
Our troubles all under rocks, filling our plastic cups
Don't bother if inside we spend those long hot nights
Until the sky turned blue
When I spend the summer on you

[Chorus: Wulf]
I spend the summer on you
When I spend the summer on you

[Verse 3: Wulf]
Most things in life ain't free
Most things in life ain't free but you were all that I need
My feet down in the sand, you take the watch from my hand
And said, "It's no more use"
When I spend the summer on you

[Verse 4: Wulf]
You were in love with the sun
We were in love with the sun, sippin' a coke and rum
You asked me, "Are you sure? Cause I can not be returned"
And so I make my move
When I spend the summer on you

[Chorus: Wulf]
When I spend the summer on you

[Bridge: Wulf]
And when I look back on those days
There's not a thing that I would change
So when the year is through
I'll be right here to spend the summer on you

[Chorus: Wulf]
When I spend the summer on you
When I spend the summer on you
