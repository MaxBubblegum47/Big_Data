Good job, Curtis!

[Hook]
Toxic
Yeah she say that I'm toxic
Block me
'Cause my feelings gettin' rocky
Coffin
Yeah I'm lookin' like a zombie
Fuck your new dude
Yeah he shop at Abercrombie
Saw me
Last month at the Roxie's
Stop me from feelin' like a dummy
Hobby
Yeah damn I need some hobbies
Runnin' through my mind like bolt when he's joggin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah the summer ends and I'll probably never see you again
Yeah it's fucked up
Heard you moved on had some fun with some of your friends
Tough luck
Miss your dog and your mom drinking wine holding hands in the rain
Now it's all gone
Just some memories on my brain it's a part of my pain
Fuck love

[Verse 2]
Move out of my momma's house
Stack up get rich on my bank account
Promise ring that I gave and it's whereabouts
All the things that you said used to calm me down
Comin' down to the states, yeah I'm comin' down
Could I look you in the face if I saw you now
All your past mistakes, they seem funny now
Funny how shit changed
Could you love me now (
now!
)
Could you love me now (
now, now, now
)
Could you love me now

Runnin' through my mind- my-my mi-
