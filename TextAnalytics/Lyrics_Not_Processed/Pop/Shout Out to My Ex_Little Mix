[Verse 1: Perrie Edwards]
This is a shout out to my ex
Heard he in love with some other chick
Yeah, yeah, that hurt me, I'll admit
Forget that boy, I'm over it
I hope she gettin’ better sex
Hope she ain't fakin’ it like I did, babe
Took four long years to call it quits
Forget that boy, I'm over it

[Pre-Chorus: Jade Thirlwall]
Guess I should say thank you
For the "hate yous" and the tattoos
Oh baby, I'm cool by the way
Ain't sure I loved you anyway
Go 'head, babe, I'ma live my life, my life, yeah

[Chorus: All]
Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the man
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now
Well, I, I'm all the way up
I swear you'll never bring me down
Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the man
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now
Well, I'm, I'm all the way up
I swear you'll never, you'll never bring me down

[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson]
Oh, I deleted all your pics
Then blocked your number from my phone, mmm
Yeah, yeah, you took all you could get
But you ain't getting this love no more
‘Cause now I'm living so legit (So legit)
Even though you broke my heart in two, baby (Scoop, scoop)
But I snapped right back, I'm so brand new, baby
(I'm so brand new)
Boy, read my lips, I'm over you, over you, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
Guess I should say thank you
For the "hate yous" and the tattoos
Oh baby, I'm cool by the way
Ain't sure I loved you anyway
Go 'head, babe, I'ma live my life, my life, yeah

[Chorus: All, Jade Thirwall & Jesy Nelson]
Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the man
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now
Well, I'm, I'm all the way up
I swear you'll never bring me down (Bring me down)
Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the man
(You're really quite the man)
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now
Well, I'm, I'm all the way up
I swear you'll never, you'll never bring me down
You’ll never bring me down

[Post-Chorus: Jade Thirwall]
You'll never bring me down (Ooh-ooh-oh), yeah

[Bridge: Perrie Edwards & All]
Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the man
