[Verse 1]
Door
Don't close the door
I want to feel the cold
I want to see the light
Momma where you gone
This is no dream
Can't make it right if it's wrong

[Chorus]
Dancing with strangers
Fighting with friends
It's a matter of time between love and despair
Falling over the line
Empty hearts and icy stares
Call me Solitaire

[Verse 2]
The eyes
In the face on the wall
Follow me round the room
Follow me everywhere
A heart without an echo
A man without a child
Alone with all my sorrow

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's a matter of time between love and despair
Falling over the line
Empty hearts and icy stares
Call me Solitaire
Solitaire [4x]
