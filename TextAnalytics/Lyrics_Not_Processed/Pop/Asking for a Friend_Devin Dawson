[Verse 1]
Hey I was just wondering if anyone was sitting here
And if not, would it be okay if someone bought you a beer
Let's say that someone wanted to dance
Would he have any snowballin' hell of a chance
To get you out on the floor before this slow song ends
Yeah, I'm just asking for a friend

[Verse 2]
He ain't ever been any good at laying it all out on the line
I swear down deep, believe me girl, he's a really good guy
If you can find it in your heart just to cut him some slack
He'd be johnny-on-the-spot here in two seconds flat
Yeah, he's holding his breath, come on give him a second with you

[Chorus]
Yeah what do you say
It's Friday night and you're beautiful, so beautiful
What man wouldn't think you were the love of his life
He'd be a fool, he'd be a fool
Just one drink would sure mean a lot to him
Yeah, I'm just asking for a friend

[Verse 3]
Let's say this friend of mine went and messed up real bad
And he'd do anything in this world, girl, to get you back
Hey what kind of sorry would it take for a man to erase his worst mistake
And would this even begin to make a dent

[Chorus]
Yeah what do you say
It's Friday night and you're beautiful, so beautiful
What man wouldn't think you were the love of his life
He'd be a fool, he'd be a fool
I don't mean to ramble on like this
Hey I'm just asking for a friend

[Verse 4]
Yeah what if I told you he hadn't slept in weeks
He was standing right here in front of you instead of me
Is there any way you could ever love him again
Just asking for a friend
