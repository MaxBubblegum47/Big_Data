A dying flame
You're free again
Who could love
And do that to you?

All dressed in black
He won't be coming back
Well, save your tears
You've got years and years

The pains of seventeens
Unreal, they're only dreams
Save your crying for the day

Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why

New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun

Miss Teenage Dream
Such a tragic scene
He knocked your crown
And ran away

First wound of pride
And how you cried and cried
But save your tears
You've got years and years

Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why

New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun

(Fool if you think it's over)
(Fool if you think it's over)

I'll buy your first good wine
We'll have a real good time
Save your crying for the day

That may not come
But anyone
Who had to pay
Would laugh at you and say

Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why

New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun

I'll buy your first good wine
Oooh, we'll have a real good time
Save your crying for the day

New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun
