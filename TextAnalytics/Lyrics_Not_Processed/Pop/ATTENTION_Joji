[Chorus]
Girl, would it kill you just to throw a little bit of attention?
If I hurt you, I'm afraid God's gonna teach me a lesson

[Pre-Chorus]
Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?

[Chorus]
When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not be so obvious?
So keep it light
So keep it light, no

[Verse]
I thought I'd vocalize my troubles, but nobody will listen
I know I'm cryptic and I'm weird, that shit comes off as indifferent
I don't wanna die so young
Got so much to do
I don't smile for the camera
Only smile for you
Smile for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?

[Chorus]
When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not?
