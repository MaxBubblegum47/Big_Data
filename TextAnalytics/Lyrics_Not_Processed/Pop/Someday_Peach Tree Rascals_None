[Chorus]
I hate the fact that you
Run on my mind all damn day
There she goes
I hate the fact that you
Run on my mind all damn day
There she goes
I hate the fact that you
Run on my mind all damn day
There she goes
I hate the fact that you
Run on my mind all damn day
There she goes

[Verse 1]
Packin' the bowl
Lady, you know
We shouldn't kick it, just ash on the floor
You need a change, I need your soul
Lately I'm crazy, I'm losing control
Don't tell your man, won't tell my bros
You on your way, I stay where they don't
Never let me go, hate it when you go
Hate it when you overrate me, make me feel like your
Boyfriend, but I ain't, we just go on dates
When he shake my hand I feel guilty always
Tonight, we fight, you make me appreciate life
For now, 'cuz then, we gotta act like we just friends
You should go away

[Chorus]
I hate the fact that you
Run on my mind all damn day
There she goes
I hate the fact that you
Run on my mind all damn day
There she goes

[Bridge]
When I was younger and dumber
And under the influence you'd drive me home
Now all the distance is longer
Intentions are harder to judge when you feel so alone
Even though I won't answer when you call
Even though we don't feel nothing at all
I see myself when I stare into dark
I close my eyes and I hear you talk
Proving I'm doing, and I ain't got you on
Proving I'm doing, and I ain't got you on

[Verse 2]
Burn like the coals, it's out of control
There's blood on the table but little I know
Dust in my eyes I'm deaf to the chimes
I packed up my shit and jumped out of your mind
Won't you wait for me?
Please won't you wait for me?

[Verse 3]
I settled down, I'm better now
I didn't know what this life was about
Tastes got too plain, colors got dull
All of the roses fell onto the floor
I pick 'em up, wipe the dust
Need a chance for your love
For your love, for your love
I've been floating between oceans
And the diamonds in the sky
I've been lonesome in this old shed
And it's burning through my mind
(lonesome in this old shed)

[Verse 4]
Don't you walk away,I want you to stay
If you shut that door on me I'll fade away
Thought of you today, to the Lord I pray
That I find my way back to your heart someday
Someday, day, someday, day
Someday, someday

Don't you walk away,I want you to stay
If you shut that door on me I'll fade away
Thought of you today, to the Lord I pray
That I find my way back to your heart someday
Someday, day, someday, day
Someday, someday
Someday, someday
Someday, someday
