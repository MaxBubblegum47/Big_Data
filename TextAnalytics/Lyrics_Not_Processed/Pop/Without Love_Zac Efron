Once I was a selfish fool
Who never understood
Never looked inside myself
Though on the outside, I looked good!
Then we met and you made me
The man I am today
Tracy, I'm in love with you
No matter what you weigh

[LINK & TRACY]
'Cause without love

[LINK]
Life is like the seasons with no summer

[LINK & TRACY]
Without love

[LINK]
Life is rock 'n' roll without a drummer
Tracy, I'll be yours forever
Cause I never wanna be
Without love
Tracy, never set me free

[LINK & TRACY]
No, I ain't lyin'
Never set me free, Tracy
No, no, no!

[SEAWEED]
Living in the ghetto
Black is everywhere you go
Who'd've thought I'd love a girl
Whose skin was white as winter snow?

[PENNY]
In my ivory tower
Life was just a hostess snack
But now I've tasted chocolate
And I'm never going back

[SEAWEED & PENNY]
'Cause without love

[SEAWEED]
Life is like a beat that you can't follow

[SEAWEED & PENNY]
Without love

[PENNY]
Life is Doris Day at the Apollo

[SEAWEED & PENNY]
Darling, I'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be

[PENNY]
Without love

[SEAWEED]
So, darlin', never set me free

[SEAWEED & PENNY]
Oh, I'm yours forever
Never set me free
No, no, no!

[LINK]
If I'm left without my baby doll
I don't know what I'll do

[TRACY]
Link, I've got to break out
So that I can get my hands on you

[SEAWEED]
And girl, if I can't touch you
Then I'm gonna lose control

[PENNY]
Seaweed, you're my black white knight
I've found my blue-eyed soul

[SEAWEED]
Sweet freedom is our goal!

[LINK]
Trace, I wanna kiss ya!

[TRACY]
Let me out at the next toll!

[ALL]
Without love

[SEAWEED]
Life is like a prom that won't invite us

[ALL]
Without love

[LINK]
Life's getting my big break and laryngitis

[ALL]
Without love

[PENNY]
Life's a '45 when you can't buy it

[ALL]
Without love

[TRACY]
Life is like my mother on a diet!

[ALL]
Like a week that's only Mondays
Only ice cream, never sundaes
Like a circle with no center
Like a door marked "Do not enter!"

Darlin' I'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be
Without love

[SEAWEED & PENNY]
Yes, now you've captured me

[ALL]
Without love

[LINK & TRACY]
I surrender happily

[ALL]
Without love
Seaweed never set me free
No no no
I ain't lying
Never set me free
No, no, no
No I don't wanna live
Without love
Darlin' you have best believe me
Never leave me without love
