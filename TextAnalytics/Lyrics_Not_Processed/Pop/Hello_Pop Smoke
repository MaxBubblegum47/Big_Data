[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
I been so gone, I like redbones
My type light skin, ass fat, Jell-O (Huh?)
But bitches be switchin' sides nowadays on the regular
I never respected it, money over bitches, I know that's everything
Money over bitches, I know that's hot
Rockin' VVS by Elliot wedding bands
I will never ever give her no wedding ring
.45 on my hip, I ain't fightin' 'em
Chewin' on an Adderall like a vitamin
Nigga pockets be on E
Something they already know but I'm drivin' a T
They makin' up rumors and lies, okay, I'm sick and I'm tired
I'm mighty fatigued, none of my bitches be mine
They coulda been one of yours, but they out of your league
I'ma just call up Fatimah
Nah, that ain't really her name, but she for the team
I get fly as a bitch like I looted up
All this 
money you talkin' ain't new to us (Woo)
I'm the King of New York, and on God
If Pop was alive, it would've been two of us

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
I like my bitches redbone, ass fat, Jell-O
Lightskin, yellow, iced out, hello
I'm the king of New York, Melo
Black hair by the regis and pello
Ask around, niggas know me
I'm a Europe boy, Ginóbili
I like my bitches redbone, ass fat, Jell-O
Lightskin, yellow, iced out, hello
I'm the king of New York, Melo
Black hair by the riches, say Pelo (Uh)
Ask around, niggas know me
I'm a Europe boy, Ginóbili

[Verse 2: Pop Smoke]
Pull up like Ace from the cleaners, ace en el fiends
Pop make a movie, sell out arenas
She off the white, talkin' Demi Lovato
All of my denims since Murder Bravado
AP Audemar wet, Aquafina
Hittin' like Ike, singin' like Tina
Dior on my body, sneakers got no creases
They limited, baby, tell me if you've seen 'em
My diamonds dancin', paint her face like Marilyn Manson (Marilyn Manson)
Then roll up that Woo, Runtz straight from Cali
Then get a plate from Sally's
Quano blew his trial, they set him up
These niggas mad as fuck
You know what I rep, yeah, it's tatted up
You ain't get fucked, 'cause your ass ain't fat enough (Nah)
If you talk crazy, get batted up, yeah

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
I like my bitches redbone, ass fat, Jell-O
Lightskin, yellow, iced out, hello
I'm the king of New York, Melo
Black hair by the regis and pello
Ask around, niggas know me
I'm a Europe boy, Ginóbili
I like my bitches redbone, ass fat, Jell-O
Lightskin, yellow, iced out, hello
I'm the king of New York, Melo
Black hair by the riches, say Pelo
Ask around, niggas know me
I'm a Europe boy, Ginóbili
