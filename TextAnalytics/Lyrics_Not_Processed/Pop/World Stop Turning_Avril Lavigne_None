[Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
Why you gotta make my world stop turning
Stop turning, world stop turning
Why you gotta take my fire thats burning
That's burning, fire that's burning
Why you gotta make my world stop turning
Stop turning, world stop turning

[Verse 1: Derek Luh]
Portraying a portrait of this kid in a fortress
Knocking all the kings man and taking all they horses
Ringing all they bells it's a power switching over
Gripping and groping queens touching knees and rubbing shoulders
Swinging from the trees flying high over soldiers
Colorado with the font, yea we got bolder
Got your baby in the front we rollin like a stroller
Goin out to war with my brothers is my soldiers
Got a lil older, got a lil smarter
Life stayed the same but my problems got harder
The way I treat these women I ain't thinking bout a daughter
Flow so cold got ice in my water
I did what I was told now my bread got larger
I'm goin bonkers on the stage, yea I go retarded

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
Why you gotta make my world stop turning
Stop turning, world stop turning
Why you gotta take my fire thats burning
That's burning, fire that's burning
Why you gotta make my world stop turning
Stop turning, world stop turning

[Verse 2: Chris Atkins]
I remember years ago when I didn't even have a buck
Now I'm tryna run the game, be the leader no runner up
Back in the day niggas ran up
Without keeping the gun tucked
And pop pop pop without you putting your hands up
You ain't gotta be on a team to get cut like a scalpel
Niggas will leave you leaking like under appreciated rappers albums
When I step up in the booth
I know you can feel the tension
Cause these lines have more punches than Vince Phillips running a juice convention
Check the description this ain't no figment of my imagination
Used to run the streets before a nigga had transportation
Now I don't need weed to get high like levitation
Cause these black and white diamonds got you feelin segregated
Devastated that I made it
While you were busy hatin
I was busy working towards my future like I was reading revelations

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
Why you gotta make my world stop turning
Stop turning, world stop turning
Why you gotta take my fire thats burning
That's burning, fire that's burning
Why you gotta make my world stop turning
Stop turning, world stop turning(x2)
