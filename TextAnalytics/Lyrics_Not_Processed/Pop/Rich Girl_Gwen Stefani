[Intro: Gwen Stefani]
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I was a rich girl
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
See, I'd have all the money in the world
If I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me
My cash flow would never ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world
If I was a wealthy girl

[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
Think what that money could bring
I'd buy everything
Clean out Vivienne Westwood
In my Galliano gown
No, wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me first class to my fancy house in London town

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
All the riches, baby, don't bring what your love can bring
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
Don't need no other, baby
Your loving is better than gold, and I know

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I was a rich girl
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
See, I'd have all the money in the world
If I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me
My cash flow would never ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world
If I was a wealthy girl

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
I'd get me four Harajuku girls to (Uh-huh)
Inspire me and they'd come to my rescue
I'd dress them wicked, I'd give them names (Yeah)
Love, Angel, Music, Baby
Hurry up and come and save me

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
All the riches, baby, won't bring what your love can bring
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
Don't need no other, baby
Your loving is better than gold, and I know

[Refrain: Eve, with Gwen Stefani]
Come together all over the world
From the hood to Japan, Harajuku Girls
What? It's all love
What? Give it up! What?
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter What?
Come together all over the world
From the hoods to Japan, Harajuku Girls
What? It's all love
What? Give it up! What?
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter

[Verse 3: Eve, with Gwen Stefani]
What happened to my life? Turned upside down
Chicks dat Blew Ya Mind, ding, it's the second round
Original track and ting, mmm
You know you can't buy these things, no
See Stefani and her L.A.M.B
I rock the Fetish, people you know who I am!
Yes, ma'am, we got the style that's wicked
I hope you can all keep up
We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top
Now we ain't gettin' nothing but love

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I was a rich girl
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
See, I'd have all the money in the world
If I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me
My cash flow would never ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world
If I was a wealthy girl

[Outro: Gwen Stefani]
Na-na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
