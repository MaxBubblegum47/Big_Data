[Verse 1]
I saw you last night
Down at the Mare
Saw how you were playin' gently with her hair
I see you and I
In my mirror
I close my eyes and wish that you would be here

[Pre-Chorus]
It's my fantasy
To have you all to me
Baby
I'm goin' privately crazy
Do you know what you're doin' to me?

[Chorus]
Stay
Make my blue moon bright for a
Change
Make my dreams end right
Don't stay
Afraid

[Break]
Be the one
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get out of my head
Get into my heart
Be for real
I can't fix who we are
I made up this lie
I made up this life
When I'm alone it's like you're right by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
It's my fantasy
To have you all to me
Baby
I'm goin' privately crazy
If you came I know just what I'd say

[Chorus]
Stay
Make my blue moon bright for a
Change
Make my dreams end right
Don't stay
Afraid
Be the one

[Bridge]
Hey, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's my fantasy
To have you all to me
Baby
I'm goin' privately crazy
If you came I know just what I'd say

[Chorus]
Stay
Make my blue moon bright for a
Change
Make my dreams end right
Don't stay
Afraid
Be the one

[Outro]
Be the one
