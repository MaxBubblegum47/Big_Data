[Chorus]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober, I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

[Verse 1]
I was sober for an hour but I'm rollin' off a bean now
The drugs, they give me confidence, I'm sayin' what I mean now
The Xannies help me slow up, the lean, it help me speed down
Ballin', yeah, I'm ballin', I won't hit it if she beat now
Callin', yeah, she callin', your bitch got me on the speed dial
Drivin' through the Rex, I look at faces, don't see no smiles
It's grimy in the 6, who can I trust? I'll never know now
Sprite is extra dark now, my dawg, he in the dog pound
They say I'm on the come up, but I've been on the come down
See me doin' good, they start to hate, that's how it goes now
I don't know why they mad at me, I always stay ten toes down
Drivin' through my city by myself, that's how I roll now

[Chorus]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

[Verse 2]
I remember being a kid, my teachers told me I wouldn't be shit
Diamonds in my pinky, look like water, make me seasick
Never had no help, so don't approach me on some free shit
Did this by myself, so why the fuck would I do a remix?
His bitch gave me top, don't want the pussy, he can keep it
Money and the power, fuck respect 'cause I don't need it
Drivin' to the west, I popped a bean and now I'm speedin'
Know some people in the 6 that dissed me for no reason
Sending shots, they sendin' shots, on road I never see them
Taking Ls, they takin' Ls, I never wanna be them
Got your bitch beside me, she just asked me what a bean is
Put her number in my phone, and you know I delete it

[Chorus]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober, I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

[Outro]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
