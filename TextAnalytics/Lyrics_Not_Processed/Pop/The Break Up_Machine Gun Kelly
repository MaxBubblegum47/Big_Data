[Verse 1]
Girl I know
I know you bought me the watch
You ain't get it back though
My name's on the back though
I flipped the lock to the back door
And took the key under the mat though
I know you hate that
But you did some things that you cannot take back
I needed change
Left a nickel for a dime
That is a payback
"What you sayin?"
Bitch I'm over you and I ain't playing
Should've been a one night stand
But here we go again....

[Chorus]
I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared
I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

[Verse 2]
Please never call me
Do not mention me in any stories
Do not show up at the homie's party
Come up to me and then say I'm sorry
You're just a
You just a — hold up let me stop
The Henny shots got the petty talk comin I don't wanna have them thoughts running
Can't believe that I bust in a thot's stomach
Fuck is wrong with you
I don't even get along with you
(Not even a little bit) 
But the head was phenomenal, 
Used to do that in the car with you
(True)
Used to travel around the world just for the rendezvous
(Come through) 
Now I gotta get high just to deal with you these are the chronicles

[Chorus]
I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted
Everything that you wanted
