[Intro]
(Wait!)
Oh yes, wait a minute, Mister Postman
(Wait!)
Wait, Mister Postman

[Chorus 1]
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Oh yeah!
(Is there a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, Mister Postman
(I've been waiting a long, long time)
Oh yeah!
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)

[Verse 1]
There must be some word someday
From my girlfriend so far away
Please, Mister Postman look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me
I've been standing here waiting, Mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying she's returning home to me

[Chorus 2]
Please, Mister Postman!
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Oh yeah!
(Is there a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, Mister Postman
(I've been waiting a long, long time)
Oh yeah!
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)

[Verse 2]
So many days you passed me by
See the tear standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter

[Chorus 3]
Mister Postman!
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Look and see
If there's a letter, oh yeah, for me
(Is there a letter in your bag for me)
I've been waiting such a long time
(I've been waiting a long, long time)
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine
(Since I heard from that girl of mine)

[Outro]
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh yeah!
(Mister Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh yeah, you got to
(Mister Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh yeah!
(Mister Postman)

Check it and see
One more time for me

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh yeah!
(Mister Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh yeah!
(Mister Postman)
Mister Postman
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh yeah
(Mister Postman)

Deliver the letter, the sooner the better

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh yeah!
(Mister Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Ooh! (Oh yeah!) You gotta
(Mister Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Oh yeah
(Mister Postman)

Gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Aah! (Oh yeah!) You gotta
Wait, wait a minute
(Oh yeah, ooh!)
