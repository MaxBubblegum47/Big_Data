[Verse 1]
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long

[Pre-Chorus]
'Til I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
But I don't need no money as long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money as long as I keep dancing

[Verse 2]
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and I won't be long

[Pre-Chorus]
'Til I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
But I don't need no money as long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money as long as I keep dancing

[Bridge]
(I love cheap thrills)
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money as long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money as long as I keep dancing

[Chorus]
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money as long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money as long as I keep dancing

[Outro]
(I love cheap thrills)
(I love cheap thrills)
(I love cheap thrills)
(I love cheap thrills)
