[Verse 1]
I've been a sinner more than I've been a saint
Spend too much time being something that I ain't
I'm sick and tired of being half right
Chasing after a past lie
Just another face in the crowd
It's time to start living out loud

[Chorus]
I wanna be free, yeah
I wanna be free, yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been a sinner more than I've been a saint
Spend too much time being something that I ain't
I'm sick and tired of being half right
Chasing after a past lie
Just another face in the crowd
It's time to start living out loud

[Chorus]
I wanna be free, yeah
I wanna be free, yeah

[Bridge]
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free

[Verse 3]
I've been a sinner more than I've been a saint
Spend too much time being something that I ain't
I'm sick and tired of being half right
Chasing after a past lie
Just another face in the crowd
It's time to start living out loud

[Chorus]
I wanna be free, yeah
I wanna be free, yeah

[Verse 4]
I've been a sinner more than I've been a saint
Spend too much time being something that I ain't
I'm sick and tired of being half right
Chasing after a past lie
Just another face in the crowd
It's time to start living out loud

[Chorus]
I wanna be free, yeah
I wanna be free, yeah

[Bridge]
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
