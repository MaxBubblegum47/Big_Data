[Verse 1]
Oh baby, would you look right there
The way the sun is hitting your hair
The way the world just stopped right here
In mid-air, I don’t ever wanna move

[Verse 2]
You put the cool in the breeze
You put the weak here in the knees
You put me right where I’m supposed to be
In your blue-eyed sea
And I wanna sail away

[Chorus]
'Cause when I wake up in the middle of the night
You’re holding me so tight
[?] my, oh, my
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone

[Verse 3]
You knock me out kiss by kiss
I need you baby, sip by sip
Sit back and let me drink you in
I’m falling for you
Over and over and over again

[Chorus]
When I wake up in the middle of the night
You’re holding me so tight
[?] my mind
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone

[Bridge]
Everywhere I want to go and
Everywhere I want to be at
Everywhere I’ve ever been
Everything I’ll ever need
Is sitting right here next to me

[Chorus]
When I wake up in the middle of the night
You’re holding me so tight
[?] my mind
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone
