[Intro]
Goodbye, no use leading with our chins
This is where our story ends
Never lovers, ever friends
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
Bitch, you're a black hole, sucking me in your vacuum
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
And I'm feeling drunk in this hotel room trying to ask you
'Bout all of your past dudes and why they stay so present
'Cause bitch if I'm the future, then why they in yo' presence?
And if I'm the king and you the queen
Then why you acting like a peasant?
(Why you acting like a peasant?)
I thought that you were gonna tell all of your exes
Goodbye, bye
(Fucked it all up! Stupid!)
Goodbye!

[Verse 2]
Let me start with Paul, have fun on your farm!
While you counting your chickens
And your goats while you getting dogged
'Cause you think you love Paola
'Cause you went and fucked Paola
But you're just enamored by pussy power
'Cause you never really got it
So when she threw it, yeah, you caught it
And I knew it but I bought it 
and Paul's just your puppy
Better keep him on your leash
'Cause the second that he finally gets some more pussy he's gon' leave
But round of applause for all the losers like Paul!
(That's just one bum you should've told)
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, let me name these hoes!
There was Blake, there was Devon, there was Igor, there was Paul
Then I found out you're a prostitute
So there's more names than I recall!
Should've listened to the cops! Should've listened to my pops!
Should've listened to Bugus, man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you
Oh, I, I really loved you
But you're a money hungry ho
Guess what I'm saying

[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye (Know you fucked this up!), bye
(And I'ma call you from the Grammies, too!)
Goodbye! (Hopefully you pick up, so I can tell you again)
Goodbye-bye-bye!
