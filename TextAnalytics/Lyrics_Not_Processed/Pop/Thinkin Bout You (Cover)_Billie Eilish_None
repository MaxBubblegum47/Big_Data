[Verse 1: Billie Eilish, 
Billie Eilish & FINNEAS

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in 
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they bawl when

[Pre-Chorus: FINNEAS, 
Billie Eilsh

I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
(Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' bout you 
(You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' bout you, 
do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus: FINNEAS, 
Billie Eilish

I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
(Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' bout you 
(You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' bout you, 
do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Bridge: FINNEAS, Billie Eilish, 
both
]
Yes of course I remember, how could I forget how you feel?
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, 
ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, 
ooh

[Outro: Billie Eilish]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, 
ooh
