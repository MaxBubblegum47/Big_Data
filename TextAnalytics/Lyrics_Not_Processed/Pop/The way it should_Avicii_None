I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

Livin' up in California
Lovin' life that I've been waiting for the
Push my dreams into my fate
Sometimes I hope it's not too late

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

~Melody~

Sometimes it's hard to have the upper hand
When every dream you had is turning into sand
You need someone to make your day
But he took your breath and blew it away

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could

~Melody~

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could
