This the part where I'm gonna get hurt
I never listened but I didn't deserve it
I was young and she was my first love
So they say that you live and you learn

[Chorus 1]
Like yeah, she gon' mess with your head
Oh yeah, and she'll flirt with your friends
Oh yeah, make you wish you were dead
Every time she moves on, she says
"Don't take it personal" (Don't take it personal)
Every time she moves on, she says
