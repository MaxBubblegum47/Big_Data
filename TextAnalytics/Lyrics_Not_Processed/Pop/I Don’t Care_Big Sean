[Verse 1: Legacy]
Hello, bad bitch
Hello, hello, bad bitch
I don't like Knicks
But the Irv got a nigga to wear that Melo swag shit
Like, ooh, yeah, you cocky huh?
But I bet you can’t take it like a Rocky punch
Trying to get it in, get it in, get it in
Wanna let my stick hit it Ms.Hockey Puck?
I'm hella throwed, get hella throat
I even got a big girl, call that bitch my jello bone
The way she blow, you can't see my shit
Got that Helen Keller dome
You ever been to that space museum?
Well, my dick just like that telescope
Ooh, damn! Ooh, damn!
That pussy for my wish list
Stop calling it kitty
Cuz 'em cats be on that fish shit
She said she’ll hit the team because it's worth it
She want many men, takin' shots like Curtis, bitch, Ahh whoop!

[Hook: Legacy]
This goes out for my bad bitches, raise your cups
Taking your girl, I don't give a fuck
I don’t care what they say
What they say
What they say
Everybody leave your man tonight
I swear you'll be glad that I took you home
Everybody leave your man tonight
And when I’m done, you gon' tell him to leave you alone
Everybody leave your man tonight

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Nigga, fuck your bitch!
Okay, I make her call me BI
Bitch I’m on my BI
All my bottles, they be knee-high
I rip G's down, I put tree high
I'm fresh out that fucking limo
And I'm everything but sober
Break, break, break, breaking that tree
And bagging it up like it's October
I walk in this bitch with a grip in my hand
I tell her I’m me, she piss in her pants
She shake it around and around and around
Her coochie's a plug, my stick is a dam
I found 20,000 and she just found my dick
So I guess we both just hit a lick
I tell her we-we-welcome, welcome to the good life
Heard you had a bad day, well, let’s make it good night
If they say we ain’t big, we’ll turn this to a Suge night
Let’s swim in alcohol and hop up on that red eye kush flight
I’m Mr. Big, bitch

[Hook: Legacy]
This goes out for my bad bitches, raise your cups
Taking your girl, I don't give a fuck
I don’t care what they say
What they say
What they say
Everybody leave your man tonight
I swear you'll be glad that I took you home
Everybody leave your man tonight
And when I’m done, you gon' tell him to leave you alone
Everybody leave your man tonight

[Verse 3: Ben J]
Bro, why your girl all up on me like I'm John Doe?
Hanging out backstage, waiting for a photo
Oh, you dance, but you's a gogo?
Well, shit, look, nice to meet you
Know your man fucking up
He can't handle your model features
Know your man lost, I'm not gon' hesitate to make you mine
I'm bout to snatch 'em up, like a food market, time to bag em up
Because I only got one night, and so we acting up
Girls get drunk, bring 'em up
So much sluts and it's so much fun
So much ass that I can't get back
So I keep on going cause I can’t get enough
Lil mama, where you going?
So much paper to be made
So much grinding to be taught
My girl prefer to give me brain

Yeah, girl, your man fronting
Fire flame, fire flame
Fuck with us, we all stunting
New Boyz
