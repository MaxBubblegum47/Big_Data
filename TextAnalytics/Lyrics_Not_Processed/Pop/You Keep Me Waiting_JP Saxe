[Verse 1: Snoh Aalegra]
Told me you loved me in October
You said I made you want to change
But here we are, another summer's over
It's all the fucking same

[Pre-Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
This conversation is getting older and older
And I'm not sure that it will ever end
Tell me again, it's not you, it's the situation
Tell me again, it's out of your control

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
You keep me waiting with the worst of you
You keep me waiting with the worst of you

[Bridge: Snoh Aalegra]
And you call that love
You give me nothing but I still can't get enough
And I call that love and I call that love
You give me nothing but I still can't get enough
And I call that love, baby you know when I call that love
You give me nothing but I still can't get enough
And I......

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Dear Ms. Aalegra, Lord I know you're fine
I know I'm not always on call, but I'll be on time
You heard from your ex-man, I can read your mind
I'm tryna get inside that thing that's in between your eyes
I need a real woman, that summer I had to realize
I'm done with the games, we should burn money in paradise
In a Vetements jacket and a pair of Docks
Make it rain in southern California, that's a paradox
Saying I'm always skating, but I keep you here waiting
Girl you know I idolize you like I'm Clay Aiken
Girl you know I fantasize about you laying naked
In a villa in Negril drinking wine as if we Jamacian
Call me Liam Neeson, tell them niggas you taken
You just so advanced, them other bitches is basic
You bad on your own, but we so much better together
Just give me the green light, I'm ready when you ready

[Verse 3: Snoh Aalegra]
Told me just to wait a little longer (but how much longer, baby?)
'Cause all that gets you through the night
Is the thought of us together
So you think that when you hold her

[Pre-Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
This conversation is getting older and older
And you keep getting harder to defend
Tell me again, it's not you, it's the situation
Tell me again, I should just understand now

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
You keep me waiting with the worst of you
You keep me waiting with the worst of you

[Outro: Snoh Aalegra]
And you call that love
