[Verse 1]
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

[Verse 2]
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh

[Chorus]
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

[Verse 2]
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh

[Chorus]
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time

[Outro]
Not a second time
Not a second time
No no no no no
Not a second time
