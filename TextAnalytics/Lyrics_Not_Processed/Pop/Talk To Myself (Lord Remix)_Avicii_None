[Verse 1]
Alone, I'm searching for devotion
In  a faded melody
My  soul is trying to cross an ocean
Down on bended knee
Lock up my cadence and rhyme
Don't  know what I'm trying to say
My  heart, all the time was stolen by bad poetry

[Chorus]
Some nights I talk to myself
I  say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I  say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me

[Verse 2]
I'm gone, the nightmares cut me open
Love's insanity
So long, words are left unspoken
I couldn't set them free
Watch all the language run dry, thoughts go on holiday
My heart, I'm left with a broken vocabulary

[Bridge]
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me

[Chorus]
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me
