[Verse 1]
Some things just aren't that simple
You called me wondering why I changed
Or why I don't look the same
Why I think so differently now

[Chorus]
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on?
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on? Count on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on

[Verse 2]
Some things just never seem to fade
I'm thinking about how we were on our first date
You understood the words I was saying
I knew I'd never let you get away

[Bridge]
Hold you tight, squeeze you right, tell you what I want
Put me in your bedroom and I'll sing a little song
Hold you tight, squeeze you right, give you all I've got
See you in the morning, over coffee, we'll talk, oh

[Chorus]
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on?
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on? Count on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
