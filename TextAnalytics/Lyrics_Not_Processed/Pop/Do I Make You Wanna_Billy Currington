[Verse 1]
Baby what's on your mind
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Post-Chorus]
Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna

[Verse 2]
Karaoke in the neon light?
Go to Vegas, stay up all night?
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little 7, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show
Or maybe just lay low?
I gotta know now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Bridge]
Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?
Baby, tell me now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now
We can take it back downtown
You know I don't care now
Just wanna take you there now
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Outro]
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Oh baby
Tell me do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Baby
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go flyin' down a two lane road?
Find a limb to hang your clothes on?
Oh, babe, tell me
Do I make you wanna?
