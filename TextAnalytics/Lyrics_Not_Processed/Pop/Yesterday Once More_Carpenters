[Verse 1]
When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waiting for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along
It made me smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well

[Chorus]
Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine

[Post-Chorus]
When they get to the part where he's breaking her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more
(Shoobidoo, wangdang)
(Shoobidoo, wangdang)

[Verse 2]
Looking back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed

[Pre-Chorus]
It was songs of love that I would sing to them
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away

[Chorus]
Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine

[Post-Chorus]
All my best memories come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more
(Shoobidoo, wangdang)
(Shoobidoo, wangdang)

[Chorus]
Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine
Every shalalala, every oho, oho
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing's
So fine
