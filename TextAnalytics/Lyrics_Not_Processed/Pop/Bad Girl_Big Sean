[Verse 1 LIT M.A.M.A]
I saw the way you looked at me
I saw that evil look you gave me
I know you smile evil
I know you a bad girl
I know you like the diamonds dancing
I know you like pulling the finger
Man you a bad girl

[Chorus Lord Twinkletoes]
Bad girl
You need to work that body
You don't even know what you've done
Bad girl
Ungrateful little girl got to steal the diamonds
You need to shake that booty a little more
Bad Girl
Well I like that

[Verse 2 LIT M.A.M.A]
I know you like to pop pills
I see you takin' drugs
I see your dope boyfriend
I know you hate me
Give me a chance bad little girl

[Chorus Lord Twinkletoes]
Bad girl
You need to work that body
You don't even know what you've done
Bad girl
Ungrateful little girl got to steal the diamonds
You need to shake that booty a little more
Bad Girl
Well I like that

[Verse 3 Lord Twinkletoes
I be poppin' pills all day
I like the way you kiss me
I know LIT M.A.M.A want you
Sorry mate I took her
You a good girl
I don't know want he's talkin' about
Dope I'm so dope
I didn't know until you told me
Kiss me again
You work that body well

[Chorus Lord Twinkletoes]
Bad girl
You need to work that body
You don't even know what you've done
Bad girl
Ungrateful little girl got to steal the diamonds
You need to shake that booty a little more
Bad Girl
Well I like that

[Outro Lord Twinkletoes]
Yeah
You a bad girl
Keep working that body
Don't stop
Don't stop
Till you had enough
