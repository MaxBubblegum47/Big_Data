[Verse 1]
With my high-starched collar and my high-top shoes
And my hair piled high upon my head
I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley and lost my heart instead
With his light brown derby and his bright green tie
He was quite the handsomest of men
I started to yen so I counted to ten
Then I counted to ten again

[Chorus 1]
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Ding, ding, ding went the bell
Zing, zing, zing went my heartstrings
From the moment I saw him I fell

[Chorus 2]
Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Bump, bump, bump went the break
Thump, thump, thump went my heartstrings
When he smiled I could feel the car shake

[Verse 2]
He tipped his hat and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

[Chorus 3]
Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Flop, flop, flop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heartstrings
As he started to go then I started to know
How it feels
When the Universe reels

[Verse 3]
The day was bright, the air was sweet
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet
You tried to sing but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

[Chorus 4]
Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Flop, flop, flop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heartstrings
As he started to leave
I took hold of his sleeve with my hand
And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me
And it was grand just to stand
With his hand holding mine
To the end of the line

[Outro]
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Zing, zing, zing went my heart
Ah, vroom
