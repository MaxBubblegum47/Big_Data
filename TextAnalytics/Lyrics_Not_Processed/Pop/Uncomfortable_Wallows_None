[Verse 1: Braeden]
Driving away, I wish I'd stayed
Another night, hasn't changed
And now I see, it's you not me
Who needs the time, you can't find anymore

[Chorus: Braeden & Dylan]
I never wanted love, but now it's come undone
I'm waiting on the time, you see I care
But now it's fading fast, thought it was gonna last
I'm not uncomfortable but I, feel so uncomfortable

[Verse 2: Dylan]
The pieces fit, perspective hits
You realize everything is the same
You say the same lines, all done on my time
As it goes on, I will be gone

[Chorus: Braeden & Dylan]
I never wanted love, but now it's come undone
I'm waiting on the time, you see I care
But now it's fading fast, thought it was gonna last
I'm not uncomfortable but I, feel so uncomfortable

[Bridge: Braeden]
When the memories bend
I'll see you at the end
And if they never fade
I won't be far away

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Braeden & Dylan]
I never wanted love, but now it's come undone
I'm waiting on the time, you see I care
But now it's fading fast, thought it was gonna last
I'm not uncomfortable but I, feel so uncomfortable
