[Intro: Michael Jackson]
Uh-huh huh huh huh
Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & 
Jackson 5
]
Oh, baby, give me one more chance (
To show you that I love you
)
Won't you please let me (
Back in your heart
)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (
Let you go, baby
)
But now since I see you in his arms (
I want you back
)

[Post-Chorus: Michael Jackson & 
Jackson 5
]
Yes, I do now (
I want you back
)
Ooh, ooh, baby (
I want you back
)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (
I want you back
)
Na, na, na, na

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Tryin' to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl, I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & 
Jackson 5
]
Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance (
To show you that I love you
)
Won't you please let me (
Back in your heart
)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (
Let 
yo
u go, baby
)
But now since I see you in his arms, uh-huh

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need

[Chorus 2: Jermaine Jackson, 
Michael Jackson
 & 
Jackson 5
]
Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby! 
Baby!
Baby! 
Baby!
Baby! 
Baby!
I want you back

[Jackie Jackson & 
Jackson 5
]
Forget what happened then
I want you back

[Jermaine Jackson]
Let me live again

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson & 
Jackson 5
]
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
I want you back

[Jackie Jackson]
Spare me of this cause

[Jermaine Jackson]
Gimme back what I lost

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
Oh baby I need one more chance ha
I tell ya that I love you
Oh! Oh! Oh! I want you back!
