[Intro: SAYGRACE, 
Audrey Mika
 & 
Tate McRae
]
These boys ain't shit (
Yeah, fuck this guy
)
I'm not here for it (
Can we say that in the song?
)
If you want me (Fuck yeah), act like it (
Wait, what?
), act like it, mm

[Verse 1: SAYGRACE]
You only hit me on the late night
I never see you in the daylight
You wonder why I got an attitude?
You make it hard for me to play nice
Have I become a habit?
Quick trip on your lips, doin' acid
And I know you think you're so cool
Oh, but it really ain't attractive

[Pre-Chorus: SAYGRACE]
Why do you waste all my time?
Keep on telling me lies
'Cause you know I'll come right back
When you don't even write back

[Chorus: SAYGRACE]
These boys ain't shit, I'm not here for it
If you want me, act like it, act like it
These boys get pissed 'cause I won't stand for it
If you want the sweet life, then act like it

[Verse 2: Tate McRae]
Only be wanting my body
Hit me up when we at parties
I've never heard you say sorry
Are you sorry?
Don't understand how your brain works
I'm always calling your phone first
You hit decline 'cause you're with her
Are you with her?

[Pre-Chorus: SAYGRACE & Tate McRae, 
SAYGRACE
 & 
Tate McRae
]
Why do you waste all my time?
Keep on telling me lies
'Cause you know I'll come right back
When you don't even
 write back, 
no

[Chorus: SAYGRACE, 
Tate McRae
 & 
Both
]
These boys ain't shit (
Ain't shit
), I'm not here for it
If you want me, 
act like it
, act like it
These boys get pissed (
They get so pissed
)
'Cause I won't stand for it (
Won't stand for it
)
If you want 
the sweet life, then act like it

[Post-Chorus: SAYGRACE & Tate McRae, 
Audrey Mika
 & 
All
]
Run it backwards
Don't be such an asshole (
Don't be such an asshole
)
Don't get mad, though
Run it, run it backwards (
Run it, run it backwards
)
Run it backwards
Don't be such an asshole
Don't get mad, though (
Ah
)
Run it, run it backwards
These boys ain't shit

[Verse 3: Audrey Mika]
Now I found my way
And I won’t let you take my time from me
I don't sit and wait
For you to tell me you're not like the other boys
And fuck another date
'Cause I don't even like you, don't even like you
These boys ain't shit (Ah)

[Chorus: SAYGRACE & Tate McRae, 
Audrey Mika
 & 
All
]
These boys ain't shit, I'm not here for it (
I'm not here for it
)
If you want me, act like it, act like it
These boys get pissed
 'cause I won't stand for it (
Ooh
)
If you want the sweet life, then act like it (
Act like it, baby, oh
)

[Post-Chorus: All & 
Audrey Mika
]
Run it backwards
Don't be such an asshole
Run it backwards (
Ah
)
Run it, run it backwards

[Outro: All]
These boys ain't shit, I'm not here for it
If you want me, act like it, act like it
