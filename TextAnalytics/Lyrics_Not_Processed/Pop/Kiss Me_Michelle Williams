[Intro: Ryan Leslie]
I wanna just, just kiss you if it's alright
Can I do that?

[Verse 1: Cassie]
One touch can bring us closer
Don't want this to be over
You know that you complete me
Your love is what I need
Don't rush to see you leaving (leaving)
Stay with me while I'm sleeping
'Cause you know what you do to me
I'm weak and you know my heart is beating

[B-Section: Cassie]
One, two, three, kiss, that's when I know that we
Four, five, six, kiss, have the right chemistry
You don't have to hold back or be shy
I can tell you want me in your eyes
One, two, three, kiss, that's when I know that we
Four, five, six, kiss, have the right chemistry
Feels so good 'cause I know that you're mine
Boy, I got my eyes closed 'cause you know that I

[Chorus: Cassie]
Love it when you kiss me (I love it)
Love it when our lips meet
You intoxicate me
I barely can breathe
I love when you kiss me (baby)
Love it when you kiss me
Love it when our lips meet
You intoxicate me (I can barely breathe)
I barely can breathe
I love when you kiss me

[Verse 2: Ryan Leslie]
Ooh girl, I'm coming over (I'm coming over, babe)
You know I wanna hold ya
Kiss you, 'cause I know you want me too (kiss you)
I wanna give you what you'll like (so please)
So, so please don't be afraid to (afraid to)
To tell me what'll make you
Reach the top (reach the top, baby)
Girl I'm needing it (I'm needing it)
'Cause baby I can feel your heart beating so fast, so fast

[B-Section: Cassie, Ryan Leslie]
One, two, three, kiss, that's when I know that we
Four, five, six, kiss, have the right chemistry (yeah)
You don't have to hold back or be shy
I can tell you want me in your eyes (you know that I want to, uh)
One, two, three, kiss, that's when I know that we (ooh yeah)
Four, five, six, kiss, have the right chemistry
Feels so good 'cause I know that you're mine
Boy, I got my eyes closed 'cause you know that I

[Chorus: Cassie, Ryan Leslie]
Love it when you kiss me (love it when you kiss me)
Love it when our lips meet (it's intoxicating)
You intoxicate me (I barely can breathe)
I barely can breathe
I love when you kiss me
Love it when you kiss me (and I love it when we)
Love it when our lips meet (love it when our lips meet)
You intoxicate me (baby I love when we)
I barely can breathe (love it when you kiss me, kiss me)
I love when you kiss me

[Break: Cassie]
Baby
Love it when you kiss me
I barely can breathe
I love when you kiss me

[Chorus: Cassie]
Love it when you kiss me
Love it when our lips meet
You intoxicate me
I barely can breathe
I love when you kiss me
Love it when you kiss me
Love it when our lips meet
You intoxicate me
I barely can breathe
I love when you kiss me
