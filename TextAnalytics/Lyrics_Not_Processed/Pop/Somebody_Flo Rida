[Intro]
Come on
Natalie La Rose

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gonna tell nobody, we ain't gonna tell nobody

[Verse 1: Natalie La Rose]
Walk in, everybody knows what's good
But some gonna hate, what's new?
We just do our thing, no time to waste
Always play it cool

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie La Rose (Jeremih)]
And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down? Oh no we won't
(We ain't never turnin' down, we ain't never turnin' down)
And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home
(And you know just what I wanna do)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody

[Verse 2: Natalie La Rose]
Walk in, everybody know what's good
We're our only plug
Bring us everything we think we need
Tonight is goin' up
Tonight is goin' up

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie La Rose (Jeremih)]
And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down? Oh no we won't
(We ain't never turnin' down, we ain't never turnin' down)
And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home
(And you know just what I wanna do)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody

[Bridge: Natalie La Rose]
In the club like what
We be in the party in the club like what
And the club like
We be in the city going dumb like what
In the club like what
We be in the party in the club like what
We be in the city going dumb like what
We be in the party in the club like what

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie La Rose (Jeremih)]
And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down? Oh no we won't
(We ain't never turnin' down, we ain't never turnin' down)
And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home
(And you know just what I wanna do)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody
