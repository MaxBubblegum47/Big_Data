[Intro: Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
Hey, hey
Damn

[Verse 1: Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
One foot in the club, everybody watch me
One pop of the booty, everybody love me
Ain't the reason I'm cocky
I make myself feel sexy
Fan of myself, I'm stannin' myself
I love me so much I put my hands on myself
Fan of myself, I'm stannin' myself
I love me so much I put my hands on myself

[Pre-Chorus: Perrie Edwards, All]
Man, I feel like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, Queen of Hearts, yeah
Tonight it's only me that matters
Oh, you on that feminist tip?
Hell yeah, I am!

[Chorus: Jesy Nelson, (Leigh-Anne Pinnock)]
I don't need a man
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can ('Cause I can)
I don't want your cash
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand (What?)
I don't need a man (Uh, uh)
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can

[Verse 2: Jade Thirlwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
Make way for the G-O, double D, E-S-S
I spare no enemies in this dress
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I make myself feel sexy
Fan of myself, I'm stannin' myself
I love me so much I put my hands on myself
Fan of myself, I'm stannin' myself
I love me so much, can't keep my hands off myself

[Pre-Chorus: Perrie Edwards, All]
Man, I feel like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, Queen of Hearts, y-yeah
Tonight it's only me that matters
Oh, you on that feminist tip?
Hell yeah, I am!

[Chorus: Jade Thirwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
I don't need a man (Need a man)
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can ('Cause I can)
I don't want your cash (Uh, uh)
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand
I don't need a man (uh-huh)
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can

[Bridge: Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
Yeah one-one, take control
Drop your man down like you don't want him no more
Say two-two, freak the floor
Drop it so low that your thighs get sore
Say one-one, take control
Drop your man down like you don't want him no more
Say two-two, freak the floor
Drop it so low that your thighs get sore

[Chorus: Jesy Nelson and Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Perrie Edwards]
I don't need a man (Need a man)
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can ('Cause I can)
I don't want your cash (Uh-huh)
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand
I don't need a man (Uh uh)
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can (Leigh, tell 'em)
I don't need a man
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can ('Cause I can)
I don't want your cash
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand
I put my own rock on my hand
I don't need a man (Uh-huh)
If I'm loving you it's 'cause I can
