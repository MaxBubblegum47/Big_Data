[Intro]
Oh-woah I, I

[Chorus]
Oh, I know things have changed
Never thought that it would end (Ooh)
But I guess nothing in life can stay the same
Would have bet it all we'd last forever
I shoulda known better
Than to say never
I shoulda known better
Than to say never

[Verse]
Oh, I've been doing fine, since you and I
Took some time to focus and realize
The cards won't fall how we want every time
But if you need to talk you can still hit my line
The way you said my name still running through my head
The way we talked for hours laying in your bed
When I'd sneak through your window to get past your dad
I'd be a liar, if I said I didn't miss that
When I said, "You are the only one," I meant that
And I still feel the same as I did way back
The type of love we had, you can't replace that
We did things together we can't take back (Yeah-yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ever need a shoulder to cry on
If you ever need someone I'm right beside you
And I know it's not the same as it once was
If I could turn the time back, baby, I would

[Chorus]
Oh, I know things have changed
Never thought that it would end
But I guess nothing in life can stay the same
Would have bet it all we'd last forever
I shoulda known better
Than to say never
I shoulda known better
Than to say never

[Pre-Chorus]
If you ever need a shoulder to cry on
If you ever need someone I'm right beside you
And I know it's not the same as it once was
If I could turn the time back, baby, I would
If you ever need a shoulder to cry on
If you ever need someone I'm right beside you
And I know it's not the same as it once was
If I could turn the time back baby I would

[Chorus]
Oh, I know things have changed
Never thought that it would end
But I guess nothing in life can stay the same
Would have bet it all we'd last forever
I shoulda known better than to say never
I shoulda known better
Than to say never

[Outro]
Oh-woah, I
