I love the racks, them bitches drive me crazy

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
I been thumbin' through the racks, thumbin' through the racks
Thumbin' through them stacks, makin' all the racks
Countin' all the racks, throwin' all the racks
I been lovin' throwin' paper
Drippin' all this sauce I got the flavor
I don't give a fuck about a hater
They said I'm the game's fuckin' savior
Ayy, if you need saved I'll save ya
Takin' sauce, takin' hoes, and I'm takin' shows
Took your flows, takin' hoes, and I'm fuckin' hoes
You already fuckin' know, and my wrist is flow
Countin' up some racks

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I love the racks, them bitches drive me crazy
I love the racks, them bitches drive me crazy
I love the racks, them bitches drive me crazy
I love the racks, them bitches drive me crazy
Drive me so insane (tryna keep my cool)
Drive me so insane (I'm just, tryna, tryna keep my cool)
Drive me so insane (I'm just, tryna, tryna keep my cool)
Drive me so insane (I'm just, tryna, tryna keep my cool)
