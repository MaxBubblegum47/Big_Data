[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
My arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?
My arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I need to step out with no frustration
I need a permanent getaway vacation
They got a permanent hit list, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
50 did it right

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
I could've been homeless
I thought I moved to orphanage for the summer
I could've been homeless
Before I had a goal, I had a course

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
My people still dry snitchin' whenever they touch the mic
That's what happens when a therapist isn't somewhere in sight
Take flight, never leaned to the left, or the right
'Cause they turn the other cheek when our niggas start to die
When our women start to die, when our children start to die
I don't feel their empathy, we been displaced too many times
Every summer in the city start to feel like Columbine
'Cause you gotta get yours, and I gotta get mine
One time for the paragons of the paradigm
When you underground, they gon' only try to undermine
Use the track as a gymnasium to get into the stadium
You couldn't match my alien, I'm glowing like uranium

[Segue: Kevin Abstract and Dom McLennon, Beyoncé]
