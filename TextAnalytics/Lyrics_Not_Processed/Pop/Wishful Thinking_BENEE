[Verse 1]
Not like I think about it night after night
Your name is echoing inside of my mind
Then I got to know you
Oh, false hopes rule
And then I opened
Right up to you

[Pre-Chorus]
This stupid act, that things aren't bad
We could never be like that
Live far away now, that's no joke
No way to reach you when I'm low

[Chorus]
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking

[Verse 2]
I do remember everything that you said
Won't let that pointless talk stay trapped in my head
Then I got to know you
Oh, false hopes rule
Those days are gone now
You left too soon

[Pre-Chorus]
This stupid act, that things aren't bad
We could never be like that
Live far away now, that's no joke
No way to reach you when I'm low

[Chorus]
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking

[Bridge]
Everything you said
Makes sense to me right now
You were just straight scared
Afraid that it might work out
Everything you said
Makes sense to me right now
You were just straight scared
Afraid that it might work out

[Chorus]
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking
Lying around, daydreaming
Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking

[Outro]
Everything you said (You said)
Makes sense to me right now (Right now)
You were just straight scared (Straight scared)
Afraid that it might work out (Work out)
Everything you said (You said)
Makes sense to me right now (Right now)
You were just straight scared (Straight scared)
Afraid that it might work out
(Afraid that it might work out)
