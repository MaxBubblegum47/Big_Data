[Interlude: Kevin Abstract]
"You know, I don't really remember the first time I got in that water, but I remember one time at my brother's birthday party. I jumped off the edge. I remember, as I was going through the air I looked to my right and everyone was doing GIFs and I just sunk to the bottom of that bitch, just sunk down. And I remember sitting on the bottom of the pool with my eyes open, knowing that I couldn't get up. Knowing that I couldn't swim up. And the craziest part is that I remember that but I don't remember how I got out. I'm still alive and, uh, yeah, man. Wear those floaties if you need 'em! Slow down when you get excited because, shit, you might just die."
