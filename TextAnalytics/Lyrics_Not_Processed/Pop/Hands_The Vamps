[Chorus: Brad Simpson]
Come on lay your hands, your hands on me
We don't have to talk 'cause talk is cheap
In the dark silence so loud
You only gotta lay your hands on me

[Interlude]
You say you're better with your
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah
You say you're better with your
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Brad Simpson]
I've been thinking about it
I've been thinking all night
Every time I try to learn your body language
Never get it right
You're so hard to read baby
So I turn off the light
And you just drop that dress to the floor
We can talk until sunrise
I've been thinking about it
The way that you blow my mind
I've been thinking about it, all night

[Chorus: Brad Simpson]
Come on lay your hands, your hands on me
We don't have to talk 'cause talk is cheap
In the dark silence so loud
You only gotta lay your hands on me

[Interlude]
You say you're better with your
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah
You say you're better with your
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]
Don't tell me about it
Keep on blowing my mind
'Cause your lips are made for kissing baby
So I put them on mine
No conversation
I've heard every line
So leave your shit at the door

[Chorus: Brad Simpson and Sabrina Carpenter]
Come on lay your hands, your hands on me
We don't have to talk
Cause talk is cheap
In the dark silence so loud
You only gotta lay your hands on me

[Interlude]
You say you're better with your
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah
You say you're better with your
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hands, yeah, yeah, yeah
