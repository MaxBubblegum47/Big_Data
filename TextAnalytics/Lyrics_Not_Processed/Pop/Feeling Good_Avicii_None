[Verse 1: Audra Mae]
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

[Verse 2: Audra Mae]
Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on a tree
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

[Bridge: Audra Mae]
Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all having fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean
And this whole world
Is a new world
And a whole world for me

[Verse 3: Audra Mae]
Stars, when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
Yes, it's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good
And I'm feeling good
