[Verse 1: Teddy Pendergrass]
I'll hold you, and touch you
And make you my woman
And give you my love with sweet surrender
Tonight our hearts will beat as one
And I will hold you, touch you
And make you my woman tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1: Whitney Houston]
There's something in your eyes I see
A pure and simple honesty

[Chorus: Both]
Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together

[Verse 2: Whitney Houston]
I believe you when you say that you love me
Know that I won't take you for granted
Tonight the magic has begun
So won't you hold me, touch me
Make me your woman tonight

[Pre-Chorus 2: Teddy Pendergrass]
There's something in your eyes I see
I won't betray your trust in me

[Chorus: Both]
Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together

[Bridge: Teddy Pendergrass, (Whitney Houston)]
I'll hold you (Hold you)
And touch you (Touch you)
And make you my woman (Make me your woman)
Tonight (Tonight)

[Chorus: Both]
Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together
Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure
Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together
