[Verse 1]
I watched a TED talk on heartbreak
He had a smart person accent
He said don't look through the photos
And then I looked through our photos
You came to Portugal in 2014
Just to spend a couple days with me
You flew halfway round the world for me

[Hook]
Now we can’t even be in the same room
My friends are making sure I don't see you
I strategize a path to the bathroom
So I don’t walk past you
You leave before the concert is finished
It’s probably for the best that you didn’t
Make us try to fake our way through
'Hey how are you'

We can’t even be in the same room
We can’t even be in the same room

[Verse 2]
I swear I’m knocking out the next guy
Who says at least you’ll get some breakup songs
Cuz it ain’t nearly been enough time
To hell with all your silver linings
I’m tempted to distract myself
I’m trying not to
Cuz I’ll make myself feel all of this
If it’s all that I got left of you

[Hook]
We can’t even be in the same room
My friends are making sure I don't see you
I strategize a path to the bathroom
So I don’t walk past you
You leave before the concert is finished
It’s probably for the best that you didn’t
Make us try to fake our way through
'Hey how are you'

We can’t even be in the same room
We can’t even be in the same room

[Bridge]
It’s hard to summarize three years
More like four years
Depends where you start counting
It don’t matter
Everyone wants an explanation
And I don’t know what to say anymore
I just don’t know what to say anymore

[Hook]
When we can’t even be in the same room
My friends are making sure I don't see you
I strategize a path to the bathroom
So I don’t walk past you
You leave before the concert is finished
It’s probably for the best that you didn’t
Make us try to fake our way through
'Hey how are you.’

We can’t even be in the same room
We can’t even be in the same room
