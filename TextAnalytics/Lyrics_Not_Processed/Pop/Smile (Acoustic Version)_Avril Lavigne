[Verse 1]
You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control, oh, oh
But you don't really give a shit
You go with it, go with it, go with it
'Cause you're fuckin' crazy rock 'n' roll

[Pre-Chorus]
You said "Hey, what's your name?"
It took one look, and now I'm not the same
Yeah, you said "Hey," and since that day
You stole my heart and you're the one to blame

[Chorus]
And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since everyday and everything
Has felt this right, and now
You turn it all around
And suddenly, you're all I need
The reason why
I smile

[Verse 2]
Last night I blacked out, I think
What did you, what did you put in my drink?
I remember makin' out and then, oh, oh
I woke up with a new tattoo
Your name was on me and my name was on you
But I would do it all over again

[Pre-Chorus]
You said "Hey, what's your name?" (what's your name?)
It took one look, and now I'm not the same
Yeah, you said "Hey" and since that day, since that day
You stole my heart and you're the one to blame

[Chorus]
And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since everyday and everything
Has felt this right, and now
You turn it all around
And suddenly, you're all I need
The reason why
I smile
The reason why
I smile

[Bridge]
(Oh) 
You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
(Oh) 
All I want to do is lose control
(Oh) 
You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
(Oh) 
All I want to do is lose control

[Chorus]
And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since everyday and everything
Has felt this right, and now
You turn it all around
And suddenly, you're all I need
The reason why I smile
It's been a while
Since everyday and everything
Has felt this right, and now
You turn it all around
And suddenly, you're all I need
The reason why
I smile
The reason why
I smile
