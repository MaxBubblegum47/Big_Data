[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin' 'bout my father lately
The person that he made me
The person I've become
And I've been trying to fill all of this empty
But, fuck, I'm still so empty
Yeah, I could use some love

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been trying to find a reason to get up
Been trying to find a reason for this stuff
In my bedroom and my closet
The baggage in my heart is still so dark

[Chorus]
Modern loneliness
We're never alone, but always depressed, yeah
Love my friends to death
But I never call and I never text, yeah
La-di-da-di-da
Yeah, you get what you give and you give what you get, so
Modern loneliness
We love to get high, but we don't know how to come down

[Verse 2]
If I could break my DNA to pieces
Rid of all my demons
If I could cleanse my soul
Then I could fill the world with all my problems
But, shit, that wouldn't solve them
So, I'm left here alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been trying to find a reason to get up
I'm trying to find a reason for this stuff
In my bedroom and my closet
The baggage in my heart is still so dark

[Chorus]
Modern loneliness
We're never alone, but always depressed, yeah
Love my friends to death
But I never call and I never text 'em
La-di-da-di-da
Yeah, you get what you give and you give what you get, so
Modern loneliness
We love to get high, but we don't know how to come down

[Post-Chorus]
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down

[Chorus]
Modern loneliness
We're never alone, but always depressed, yeah
Love my friends to death
But I never call and I never text 'em
La-di-da-di-da
Yeah, you get what you give and you give what you get, so
Modern loneliness
We love to get high, but we don't know how to come down

[Post-Chorus]
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down (I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin')
We don't know how to come down (Please don't wake me up)
Down, down, down, down, down (I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin')
We don't know how to come down (Please don't wake me up)

[Outro]
Modern loneliness
We're never alone, but always depressed, yeah
