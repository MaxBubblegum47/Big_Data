[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Take another photo
Post it for the world to see
People that you don't know
Who the hell you tryna please?

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Living like a credit card
Pray you never see the charge
Doctor, doctor, hide the scars, please
Those Hype Williams videos
Taught you how to wear your clothes
Drop it low, touchin' your toes

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
When did all these good girls decide to be bad?
Dancin' up on the table, gettin' back at your dad
Who's the asshole that told you that's what you had to do?
Yeah, but when did all these good girls decide to be bad?
You know I love your skin, but is it deeper than that?
Don't wanna blame you for it, 'cause that's what we ask of you
Yeah, but when did all these good girls?

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Goin' out to the girls in the club who put it down, yeah
Who know sexy isn't just what you see, yeah
I ain't mad a little game of runaround (Runaround)
Long as you can keep up with me

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Living like a credit card
Pray you never see the charge
Doctor, doctor, hide the scars, please
Those Hype Williams videos
Taught you how to wear your clothes
Drop it low, touchin' your toes

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
When did all these good girls decide to be bad?
Dancin' up on the table, gettin' back at your dad
Who's the asshole that told you that's what you had to do?
Yeah, but when did all these good girls decide to be bad?
You know I love your skin, but is it deeper than that?
Don't wanna blame you for it, 'cause that's what we ask of you
That's what we ask
But when did all these good girls?
But when did all these good girls?

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I used to be too bad for the good girls
Now I'm too good for the bad girls, no middle ground
Funny how big cities turn to little towns
When you tend to get around, I think we should sit her down
Girl, you're way too good to be in here
I see what they don't see, and see it clear
I think we should prolly take a little time out
You know, slow it down, clear your mind out
Figure out what you're into
You don't strike me as a club girl, you seem more residential
To keep it real, I just want a bad girl tonight
And a good girl for life, all I seen was potential

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
When did all these good girls decide to be bad?
You know I love your skin, but it's much deeper than that
And gotta thank you for it, for showin' me all of you

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
When did all these good girls decide to be bad?
Dancin' up on the table, gettin' back at your dad
Who's the asshole that told you that's what you had to do?
Yeah, but when did all these good girls decide to be bad?
You know I love your skin, but is it deeper than that?
Don't wanna blame you for it, 'cause that's what we ask of you
That's what we ask
But when did all these good girls?
