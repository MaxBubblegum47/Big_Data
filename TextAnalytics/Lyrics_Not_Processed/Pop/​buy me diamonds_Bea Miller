[Verse 1]
You made me feel so unwanted
Made the decision to leave you behind
You say you've changed and you're sorry
But I don't wanna know

[Pre-Chorus]
So give me something I can hold
That I can trust and call my own
And won't run out and leave me cold
Give me something that won't tell me lies
Won't leave me hanging out to dry
Won't fuck me over make me cry

[Chorus]
Save your love and buy me diamonds
Save your love and buy me diamonds

[Post-Chorus]
Give me something I can hold
That I can trust and call my own
And won't run out and leave me cold
Save your love and buy me diamonds

[Verse 2]
You know that you can't live without me
Got caught in the game that you play with my mind
Keep saying you've changed and you're sorry
But I don't wanna know

[Pre-Chorus]
So give me something I can hold
That I can trust and call my own
And won't run out and leave me cold
Give me something that won't tell me lies
Won't leave me hanging out to dry
Won't fuck me over make me cry

[Chorus]
Save your love and buy me diamonds
Save your love and buy me diamonds

[Post-Chorus]
Give me something I can hold
That I can trust and call my own
And won't run out and leave me cold
Save your love and buy me diamonds

[Bridge]
You tried to take my light
Took me so long to find it
I'm moving on tonight
Moving on with my life
You tried to take my light
Took me so long to find it
I'm moving on tonight

[Chorus]
Save your love and buy me diamonds
Save your love and buy me diamonds

[Post-Chorus]
Give me something I can hold
That I can trust and call my own
And won't run out and leave me cold
Save your love and buy me diamonds

[Outro]
You tried to take my light
Took me so long to find it (it took so long)
I'm moving on tonight
Moving on with my life (save your love and buy me diamonds)
You tried to take my light
Took me so long to find it
I'm moving on tonight
Save your love and buy me diamonds
