[Verse 1]
What's with the drugs (these days?)
These days I don't feel nothin'
Unless our bodies touchin', babe
Losin' my buzz, on no
Go get the bartender
Fix me up something better, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't get high
No, I can't get high no, no, no
No, I can't get high
No, I can't get high

[Chorus]
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
All of these drugs, they ain't enough
They don't do what your body does
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
All of these drugs, they ain't enough
I can't get high without your love

[Post-Chorus]
I can't get high, oh no, oh no
I can't get high without your love

[Verse 2]
You got me on one, uh-huh
Now you're the only reason
I go downtown on the weekend, babe
What's up with the drugs? They don't
No, they don't feel the same
Ain't callin' my dealer
'Cause I got you feelin' my body, babe (my body, babe)

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I can't get high
No, I can't get high, no, no, no
No, I can't get high
No, I can't get high

[Chorus]
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
All of these drugs, they ain't enough
They don't do what your body does
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
All of these drugs, they ain't enough
I can't get high without your love

[Post-Chorus]
I can't get high, oh no, oh no
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high, oh no, oh no
I can't get high without your love

[Bridge]
What's up with the drugs?
These days, these days
You got me on one
I can't, I can't

[Chorus]
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
All of these drugs, they ain't enough
They don't do what your body does
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
All of these drugs, they ain't enough
I can't get high without your love

[Outro]
(I can't get high without your love)
I need it so bad, I need it so bad
I'm never sober, I need it, I need it
I need it so bad, I need it so bad
I'm never sober, I need it, I need it
(So good, I need it so bad)
(So good, I need it so bad)
