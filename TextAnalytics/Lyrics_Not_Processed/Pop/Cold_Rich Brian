[Verse 1]
Saw a car crash, it remind me of our first date
Then I went back, got massages at that one place
Always brought friends but today I feel like doin' this shit alone
Callin' my dad when I wanna hear some wisdom
Callin' my cab alcohol up in my system
Saw a fist fight and that shit don't even make me scared no more
Man, I never been the one to be alone
All my friends are always hittin' up my phone
Every day is spent with everybody, never on my own
But today I'm by myself and I don't even feel alone
Like to smoke cigs every time I feel the outside
Like to play chicks but get mad when they get new guys
You don't get me but I don't blame you, I don't get myself
Pressin' on keys, got my life so sweet man
GoFundMe on your bitch's pinned tweet man
Bumpin' oldies as I try to dick her down
She said give it to me now, and I can't help but listen
She go, "Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh"
Slippery sign all over my door
Show some attitude and bitch I won't show
Expectation high, I feel like a drone
2018, I got some new goals
Not checkin' my statement 'til I got 4 mill
Rushin' all year like I commit roadkill
Killin' everybody like I'm in a wrong deal
Do triple checks on every move I make
Work 'til I'm tired then sip on some latte
Only do shit if we do it my way
Everything gon' depend on what I say
3, 4

[Verse 2]
Ayy, hold up, wait a second
Man, my flow on lethal weapon
Hit 'em with the rhymin' pattern
Put these rappers under pressure
This feel like Armageddon
If she witcha I'ma get her
Cut you off like Jerry Heller
She gon' need another fella, ayy
I don't take drugs, I just take naps
Find another girl to eat up like I hate snacks
Dick gon' make her choke like reflux, gotta relax
Man, yo' shit is borin' and it's makin' me go sleep fast
And I always care 'bout everybody but myself
That's the life of a Virgo, never gettin' mad
That's not the Brian that we know
I just weighed my heart, it's about 30 kilos
I just fucked a lady and she 'bout 30 years old
Rappin' on this instrumentals, feelin' like a hero
Never usin' triplet flows because I'm not a Migo
Only lastin' longer 'cause I'm drunk, I don't think she knows
Only thing that matters that my dick is like my ego
They wishin' I'ma fail
These days, no picnics, ain't no fun and games
Still, motherfuckas always got a lot to say
Never got love, so they spreadin' all this hate oh, oh
Man they always actin' real tough
But I show up for a show and they just wanna leave town
People sayin' that my words are colder than the winter
It's Brian, not Brita, so I'll never have a filter
