[Verse 1]
Cancel my subscription
I don't need your issues, yeah
Quit tryna make me feel bad
When I can do that on my own
You were my addiction
That’s why I'm gonna miss you, yeah
Why you tryna hurt me
When I can do that on my own?

[Pre-Chorus]
All the nights, and the fights
'Til we forgot what we fighting for
And I knew I was right
We can’t do it like this no more

[Chorus]
I hate that it didn't work out this time
Like I thought it would
I was getting kinda used to calling you mine
Now you're gone for good
I told you that I'm not that strong
I wanted you to prove me wrong
And I hate to say that I told you so (Told you so)
But I told you so

[Post-Chorus]
But I told you so (Told you so)
But I told you so

[Verse 2]
I said it from the first kiss, yeah, yeah, yeah
I coulda heard the clock tick, yeah, yeah, yeah
Remember how I told you, yeah, yeah
We were better off alone

[Pre-Chorus]
All the nights, all the fights
'Til we forgot what we fighting for
And I knew I was right
We can't do it like this no more

[Chorus]
I hate that it didn't work out this time
Like I thought it would (Yeah)
I was getting kinda used to calling you mine
Now you're gone for good
I told you that I’m not that strong (Not that strong)
I wanted you to prove me wrong
And I hate to say that I told you so
But I told you so
I hate that it didn’t work out this time
Like I thought it would
I was getting kinda used to calling you mine
Now you're gone for good
I told you that I’m not that strong
I wanted you to prove me wrong
And I hate to say that I told you so (Told you so)
But I told you so

[Bridge]
All the nights, and the fights
'Til we forgot what we fighting for
And I knew I was right
We can't do it like this no more

[Chorus]
I hate that it didn't work out this time
Like I thought it would
I was getting kinda used to calling you mine
Now you’re gone for good
I told you that I'm not that strong
I wanted you to prove me wrong
And I hate to say that I told you so (Told you so)
But I told you so

[Post-Chorus]
But I told you so (Told you so)
But I told you so
And I hate to say that I told you so (Told you so)
But I told you so
