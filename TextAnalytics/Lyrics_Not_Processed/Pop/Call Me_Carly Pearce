[Verse 1]
I bet you're watchin' that clock tick-tock, sittin' all alone
Tryin' to fix that broken-heart heartbreak on your own
I bet it's been a little while since you let yourself have some fun
Well, baby, you don't need no permission
But if you need a reason, I could be the one

[Pre-Chorus]
We can go downtown
We can stay out all night
Turnin' the neon into morning light
Why would you stay home?
No need to be lonely
You got my number

[Chorus]
For a good time, call me
Whatever you want, that's all me
Yeah, I can be that somebody
That you're gonna hold tonight (Tonight)
For a good time, call me
Baby, you won't be sorry
Lay your hands and your kisses on me
And I'll make it all alright (Alright), alright

[Verse 2]
I got a mix that I made for the weekend on the stereo
I got a black leather jacket and a red dress, ready to glow
The only thing missin' is you knock, knock, knockin' on my door
Well, you don't need a map, you know where I'm at
Tell me, baby, what you're waitin' for

[Pre-Chorus]
We can go downtown
We can stay out all night
Turnin' the neon into morning light
Why would you stay home?
No need to be lonely
You got my number

[Chorus]
For a good time, call me
Whatever you want, that's all me
Yeah, I can be that somebody
That you're gonna hold tonight (Tonight)
Yeah, for a good time, call me
Baby, you won't be sorry
Lay your hands and your kisses on me
And I'll make it all alright (Alright), alright

[Pre-Chorus]
(We can go downtown) We can go downtown
We can stay out all night
Turnin' the neon (Turnin' the neon) into morning light
So why would you stay home?
No need to be lonely
You got my number

[Chorus]
For a good time, call me
Whatever you want, that's all me
Yeah, I can be that somebody
That you're gonna hold tonight (Tonight)
Yeah, for a good time, call me
Baby, you won't be sorry
Lay your hands and your kisses on me
And I'll make it all alright (Alright)

[Outro]
For a good time, call me
Baby, call me
Baby, call me
Yeah, baby, what you're waitin' for tonight
