[Chorus]
When you're faded and alone
And need somebody on the phone
Let it be me, let it be me
When she leaves you in the rain
You need a high to kill the pain
Let it be me, let it be me
And I'll show you love the way it supposed to be

[Post-Chorus]
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da

[Verse]
Summer days, winter nights
Ride or die, right by your side
Killing time till you're ready to see I'm all you need
You're a drunk, you're a fool
I'm insane, so right for you
When the ship goes down
Look in your dreams, that's where I'll be
'Cause I ne-ne-ne-need you
And I la-la-la-la-love ya
But I wanna-wanna-wanna
Just stay the night

[Chorus]
When you're faded and alone
And need somebody on the phone
Let it be me, let it be me
When she leaves you in the rain
You need a high to kill the pain
Let it be me, let it be me
And I'll show you love the way it supposed to be

[Post-Chorus]
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
And I'll show you love the way it supposed to be

[Bridge]
'Cause I ne-ne-ne-need you
And I la-la-la-la-love ya
But I wanna-wanna-wanna
Just stay the night
And I ne-ne-ne-need you
And I la-la-la-la-love ya
Oh, no-no-no
I won't let you, won't let you go

[Chorus]
When you're faded and alone
You need somebody on the phone
Let it be me, let it be me
When she leaves you in the rain
You need a high to kill the pain
Let it be me, let it be me
And I'll show you love the way it supposed to be

[Post-Chorus]
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
And I'll show you love the way it supposed to be
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ta-da-da-da
And I'll show you love the way it supposed to be
