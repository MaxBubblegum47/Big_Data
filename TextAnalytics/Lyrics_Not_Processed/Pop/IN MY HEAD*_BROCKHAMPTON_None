[Intro: Kevin Abstract and 
JOBA
]
I know I always do it better when I see ya
I know I always gotta leave in such a hurry
Left me in the sink with my face all dirty
Parked outside of Sonic and my niggas got
Got too much shit to think about
 (I know I'm broken)
Got too much shit to think about
 (Yeah nigga, I know)

[Chorus: JOBA]
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Tell me who I am, I don't know
I'm doing dumb shit I did before (Nothing in my head ever makes sense)
Running from all I know
Hate it when my mama calls (Nothing in my head ever makes sense)

[Post-Chorus: JOBA]
Her baby boy has lost his soul
The life he lives sure takes a toll
It's all in my head
It's all in my head

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
They tryna publicate these watered down soliloquies
And wonder why I don't reciprocate the energy
I'm movin' vividly, I ain't for the civility
They check my brilliancy, uh
What's next when you shake up the world within a trilogy?
Become a better human? Check your masculinity?
The Brutuses around you start to move suspiciously
Too many voices around me, I don't need a polyphony
This ain't for dignity
This ain't for principle
It's just the truth that there's nobody that's invincible

[Chorus: JOBA]
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Tell me who I am, I don't know
I'm doing dumb shit I did before (Nothing in my head ever makes sense)
Running from all I know (Nothing in my head ever makes sense)
Hate it when my mama call

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
What's heaven look like?
What our brothers look like?
What he look like when he realize that we not alike?
I was younger, I would pretend my toothbrush was a mic
Late to school 'cause I was singing in the mirror like I just got signed
(Your truth gon' set me free)
(Your truth gon' set me free)
I'm hangin' on by a rope, come on Angelo
Come on, let me grow, let me love, let me glow
Had the TV show, shit let me know
Can't trust people
Cried thinkin' about how I can't help people that put me first
Man, the pride shit hurt 'cause I know ma hurt
Do I help her or watch her hurt?
Bein' petty by the time she put me first
It could be made up (Ah, ah)
It's probably made up (Ah)
