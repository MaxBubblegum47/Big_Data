[Verse 1]
I've been sleeping, barely dreaming
Through one year and one half
Found another, called him my lover
Helped me get my old self back

[Pre-Chorus]
It was you-ou-ou-ou
It was you-ou-ou-ou
Only you-ou-ou-ou
You remind me, oh, you bring me back

[Chorus]
And you said
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning

[Verse 2]
Oh, I was reckless, once was breathless
Running from that day I snapped
But I've got a feeling and keep believing
I'm never gonna give this back

[Pre-Chorus]
It was you-ou-ou-ou
It was you-ou-ou-ou
Only you-ou-ou-ou
Oh, I'm never gonna give this back

[Chorus]
And you said
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning

[Bridge]
And if you're giving up, would you tell me?
I'm gonna keep this love if you let me
And if you're giving up, would you tell me?
I'm gonna keep this love

[Chorus]
And you said
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning
"Let me help you wake you up
Let me help you break you up
Let me help you open up"
I'm in love, I'm alive
Oh, I'm burning
