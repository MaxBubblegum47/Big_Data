(Hook)
If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades
Just to hide your face
And you wear them around like you're cooler than me
And you never say "Hey"
Or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me
(Verse 1)
You got your high brown
Shoes on your feet
And you wear them around
Like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh
(Bridge)
I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you so fake
You probably think that this song is about you, don't you?
(Hook)
(Verse 2)
You got your high brown
Switch when you walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh
(Bridge)

(Big Sean)
Now don't you dare act like you don't know
Know what's up, cause your nose is up
When I'm approachin' up, pshht, yup
Like I can give you winter in the summer
Or summer in the winter, Miami in December
Tryna look bored in them Dior
She probably is
Was actin' shallow 'til she found out how deep that my pockets is
Mrs. Primadonna, this is your reminder
That I think you fine, but I'm finer
Sean, yup
Cause it sure seems (cause it sure seems)
You got no doubts (that you got no doubts)
But we all see (we all see)
You got your head in the clouds
(Hook)
