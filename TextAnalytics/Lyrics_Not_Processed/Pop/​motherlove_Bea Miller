[Verse 1]
I know why you're hittin' me up
All you ever want is to fuck with me
But I don't ever have any fun
'Cause you don't even know when I'm coming clean
You're gonna run and tell all your bros
All the dirty things that you do to me
It's kinda funny, they'll never know
That you're only doing 'em in your dreams (hey)

[Chorus]
Don't call me just because you have nobody else (hey, hey)
You're desperate and full of shit, boy, I can tell (hey, hey)
Don't call me just because you have nobody else (hey, hey)
I'd rather lay in bed and motherlove myself

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
I'd rather lay in bed and motherlove myself

[Verse 2]
All I know is if you were here
We would have to do what you like to do
But I'ma do what I like, I'ma do it just right
And I'll do it better than you

[Chorus]
Don't call me just because you have nobody else (hey, hey)
You're desperate and full of shit, boy, I can tell (hey, hey)
Don't call me just because you have nobody else (hey, hey)
I'd rather lay in bed and motherlove myself

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
I'd rather lay in bed and motherlove myself

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I can't help it, but I want you badly
Even though you never had me
And I, I realize that the only time that we get closer
Is when you wanna fuck me over

[Chorus]
Don't call me just because you have nobody else (hey, hey)
You're desperate and full of shit, boy, I can tell
Don't call me just because you have nobody else (else, oh)
I'd rather lay in bed and motherlove myself

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
I'd rather lay in bed and motherlove myself, oh
