[Intro: Timbaland]
Take it back, take it back, take it back
Oh oh oh ah oh
Oh ah oh oh oh ah

[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado & (Timbaland)]
Everybody look at me, me (Oh)
I walk in the door, you start screaming (Oh)
Come on, everybody, what you here for? (Oh)
Move your body around like a nympho (Oh)
Everybody get your necks to crack around (Oh)
All you crazy people, come on, jump around (Oh)
I wanna see you all on your knees, knees (Oh)
You either wanna be with me, or be me
(Come on, now)

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard, make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars
Make you cut cards, make you fall real hard in love
She's a maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard, make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars
Make you cut cards,
 
wish you never ever met her at all

[Verse 2: Nelly Furtado & (Timbaland)]
And when she walks, she walks with passion (Oh)
When she talks, she talks like she can handle it (Oh)
When she asks for somethin', boy, she means it (Oh)
Even if you never ever seen it (Oh)
Everybody get your necks to crack around (Oh)
All you crazy people, come on, jump around (Oh)
You doin' anything to keep her by your side (Oh)
Because, she said she love you, love you long time
(Come on, now)

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard, make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars
Make you cut cards, make you fall real hard in love
She's a maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard, make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars
Make you cut cards,
 
wish you never ever met her at all

[Interlude: Nelly Furtado & (Timbaland)]
(Oh)
Ah-ah-ah-ah oh (Oh)
Ah-ah-ah-ah oh (Oh)
Ah-ah-ah-ah oh (Oh)
Ah-ah-ah-ah yeah
(Come on, now)

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard, make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars
Make you cut cards, make you fall real hard in love
She's a maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard, make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars
Make you cut cards,
 
wish you never ever met her at all

[Bridge: Nelly Furtado & (Timbaland)]
No, never ever met her at all (What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you never ever met her at all (What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you never ever met her at all (What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you never ever met her at all (Come on!)
You wish you never ever met her at all (What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you never ever met her at all (What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you never ever met her at all (What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you never ever met her at all (Break!)
(I been around the world I ain't never meet a girl like this)
She's a maneater, a maneater
(I been around the world I ain't never meet a girl like this)
She's a maneater, a maneater
(I been around the world I ain't never meet a girl like this)
She's a maneater, a maneater
(I been around the world I ain't never meet a girl like this)
Like this, like this, like this, like this
