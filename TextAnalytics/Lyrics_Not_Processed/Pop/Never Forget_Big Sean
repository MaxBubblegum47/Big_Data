Intro]
(Big Sean baby, holla at your boy)
(It’s your boy, come and give me)

[Verse 1]
Man I remember days I used to get up
Praying like a bishop that this music stuff would pick up
I always tried to haul my own load like a pickup
No ordinary nigga
And if you work harder then success will come quicker
But make sure you don't take it to the head like liquor
Aim for the stars, I’m shooting for the bigger dipper
Nights I used to sit up
Man I could feel the hunger in my stomach like sit-ups
Now I’m eating to the point that a nigga got the hiccups
I get up like, damn
I see the sun shine through the dust clouds
We bought our own cars, no more taking the bus now
And it ain’t bust a broad or hoes that we bust down
You should probably see the model chicks that we bust now
And we don’t chase them ‘cause they wanna chase us now
All my ex-dames say they wanna make up now
Take ‘em to the room and they wanna rape us now
Damn

[Pre-Hook]
(We’ll never forget)
We never will, we never will
(The love that you showed)
(We’ll never forget)
We never will, we never will
(The love that you showed)

[Hook]
Man I went through the cold nights
(We’ll never forget)
The wrongs and rights
(The love that you showed)
But I woulda did it twice for the hoes and the highs
(We’ll never forget)
The fights, the struggle on the grind, the hustle
(The love that you showed)
But I woulda did it twice for the shows and the lights

[Verse 2]
Man my city a hell hole like we like with Satan
Tried to make it to Penn State, they throw us in state pen
I’m saying from the rim of the capitol
Concrete jungle where they hunt you like animals
Cut you in half like the sandwich and abandon you
You gon’ need a bit more than a bandaid to bandage you
Damn it dude
And if you turn your back they might stab you in the kidneys
Really niggas known to keep the peace a hippy
But now I tend to spread my wealth around like Jiffy
And the hoes that used to diss me is the ones who wanna kiss me
The ones who wanna kiss me is the ones who wanna quickie
They see I ball hard now, all nine innings
I feel like I made it to the top of the mountain
Rocking designer shit that you don’t be pronouncing
Pissing in fountains
Getting money to the point I need an accountant
Just to count it, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
(We’ll never forget)
We never will, we never will
(The love that you showed)
(We’ll never forget)
We never will, we never will
(The love that you showed)

[Hook]
Man I went through the cold nights
(We’ll never forget)
The wrongs and rights
(The love that you showed)
But I woulda did it twice for the hoes and the highs
(We’ll never forget)
The fights, the struggle on the grind, the hustle
(The love that you showed)
But I woulda did it twice for the shows and the lights

[Outro]
Man shoutout to me and my crew
Feels good to make something out of nothing, you know
Aye DJ why don't you play some of my shit, man?
(We’re gonna play your favorite song for you)
