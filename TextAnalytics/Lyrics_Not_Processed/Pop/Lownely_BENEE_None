[Chorus]
I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I been lonely

[Verse 1]
Water pouring down from the ceilin'
I knew this would happen, still hard to believe it
Maybe I'm dramatic, I don't wanna seem it
I don't wanna panic

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a sad girl in this big world
It's a mad world
All of my friends know what's happened
You're a bad thing

[Chorus]
I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mmm, ah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely, I'm a lonely bitch
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely, super lonely

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in the bathtub, cryin'
Think I'm slowly sinking
Bubbles in my eyes now
Maybe I'm just dreamin'
Now I'm in the sad club
Just tryna get a backrub (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a sad girl in this big world
It's a mad world (Oh)
All of my friends know what's happened
You're a bad thing, no

[Chorus]
I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (Lonely bitch)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely

[Outro]
Yeah, I've been lonely, I've been lonely (La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Lonely (I've been lonely, by the way)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely
