[Verse 1]
I'm not thinkin' 'bout if you're home alone
Walkin' 'round in my old t-shirt
I'm not thinkin' 'bout if you're out with friends
Tryna act cute when you flirt
I'm not thinkin' 'bout if when I walk out
You'll be standin' at my door
And, outta all the things I do

[Chorus]
I don't think about you, no, no
I don't think about you, oh no
I don't think about all the things that we've been through
Don't remember who broke up with who
Don't think about you, ohh
But I know you do

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I know you do
Ahh

[Verse 2]
I don't care about all the promises
That eventually you broke
I don't care about all the words that you never say
Stuck in your throat
I don't care about if you're sorry now
And you're waitin' by the phone
And, outta all the things I do

[Chorus]
I don't think about you, no-oh
I don't think about you, oh no
I don't think about all the things that we've been through
Don't remember who broke up with who
Don't think about you, ohh
But I know you do

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-ohh
Yeah, I know you do-uhh
I know you do
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't think about you, wouh-ohh
I don't think about you, ohh
I don't think about all the things that we've been through
Don't remember who broke up with who
Don't think about you, ohh
But I know you do

[Post-Chorus]
Ahh, yeah, I know you do-uhh
I know you do
Yeah,I know you do-uhh
But I still love you
