Lil Mama and Avril Lavigne

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne (Lil Mama)]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
(I could be your girl, Lil Mama be your girlfriend)
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend
(I could be your girl, Lil Mama be your girlfriend)

[Verse 1: Lil Mama]
Don't get it twisted, Lil Mama got her paper on
That mean I'm a paper chaser, I chase my paper on
And I gon' be chasing paper that you be chasing on
I just deliver them lyrics that people focus on
Get up in the booth and a chopped up song, put it in a store and they go cops on
Everybody know that it's no comp-o, y'all better lay low like popos
Case you ain't know, better already know, I goes in like project so
So get it, Biggie Mama, B-R-double-O-K-lyn drama

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & (Lil Mama)]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
(I could be your girl, Lil Mama be your girlfriend)
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend
(I could be your girl, Lil Mama be your girlfriend)

[Verse 2: Lil Mama]
Please, eight bars and stop, all I know's sixteen to pop
Told y'all y'all better act on top, been doing this since Hop on Pop
Aww, got it but I can't stop
Problem is I'm crack on rocks
Problem is they love Mama style so I gotta go harder than I did before
Her style is crossover
Pee wee curling, Lil Mama, Miss Kirkland's going in
So when you see me in the drop top shades
In the summertime blazing, you wanna be my boyfriend

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & (Lil Mama)]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
(I could be your girl, Lil Mama be your girlfriend)
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend
(I could be your girl, Lil Mama be your girlfriend)

[Bridge: Avril Lavigne]
In a second, you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?
In a second, you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

[Verse 3: Lil Mama]
I ain't hatin', but your girl's a bird, you by my side, make it work
You and her? That sound absurd, me and you more better, you heard?
You hear the way them girls laugh in the back?
That's 'cause I spit crack on the track
I'mma keep it real boy, I'm trying to mack
Let me know if you down with that
Me and your girlfriend, we ain't no tie, you better ask T.I
I am telling you like Jennifer Hudson
I got plastic elastic in the back of the Jaguar [?] plus stacks I'm popping
Tags on purses, bags is filled, I laugh 'cause this is nothing

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & (Lil Mama)]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
(I could be your girl, Lil Mama be your girlfriend)
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend
(I could be your girl, Lil Mama be your girlfriend)
No way, no way, hey, hey
