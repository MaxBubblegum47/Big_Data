Break it to me gently, let me down the easy way
Make me feel that you still love me, if it's just, if it's just for one more day
Break it to me gently, so my tears, my tears won't fall too fast

If you must go, then go slowly
Let me love you 'till the last

The love we shared, for oh so long is such a big part of me
If you must take your love away, take it gradually

Oh, oh...break it, break it to me gently
Give me time, oh give me a little time to ease the pain
Love me just a little longer, cause I'll never never love again
Cause I'll never love again
