[Intro]
Steve Aoki, woozy gang

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Wouldn't be me without you
Wouldn't be me without you
So damn real
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Walk in the buildin', everybody stare
Never made it to the room, I fucked her on the steps
You either got balls or you shoot like Steph
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Drop]

[Verse: 2 Chainz]
I met her pumpin' gas at pump 10
I pulled up in the Wraith, she was ridin' with her friends
License plate outta state, I don't know why they were here
But you lookin' at the player of the year, you called it
I can make her panties fallin' like it's August
I'm all in, nigga ballin', bitch, you ballin'
Pull up in somethin' foreign, like errr
I just spent a dime at the mall
Tryna spend some time in the job
Then she put her hands on my balls

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Wouldn't be me without you
Wouldn't be me without you
Walk in the buildin', everybody stare
Never made it to the room, I fucked her on the steps
You either got balls or you shoot like Steph
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Drop]

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Wouldn't be me without you
Wouldn't be me without you
So damn real
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Walk in the buildin', everybody stare
Never made it to the room, I fucked her on the steps
You either got balls or you shoot like Steph
Yeah, yeah, yeah
