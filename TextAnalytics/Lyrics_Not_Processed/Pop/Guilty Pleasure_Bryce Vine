[Verse 1]
I wake up in Vegas and I lose a couple grand, I take a couple shots, I’m feeling good again
I told my girl that I was going straight home. (Ya right) I hope she doesn’t see the photos on my phone (All right!)
I done a couple things you’ll never hear about. Like when I passed out, inside an In N Out
I told my momma I was goin straight home, I got arrested climbin’ telephone poles (All right!)

[Pre-Hook]
I ain’t proud of all of it (All right!)
But I’d do it all again (All right!)
'Cause it’s all been hella fun
I can’t give a fuck I’m just livin' like, "So what?"

[Hook]
I live a life of leisure
Full of guilty pleasure
I can’t give a fuck I’m just livin’ like, "So what?"
It couldn’t get much better
Only guilty pleasure
I can’t give a fuck I’m just livin’ like, "So what?"

[Verse 2]
Still takin’ no advice, and telling little lies
Still makin’ girls blush, just like in junior high
We made a livin’ crashin parties til dawn
My homie fell asleep and totaled my car, (All right!)
I done a couple things you’ll never know about
Some I’m ashamed of, some I forgot about
But I’ll be fine, chase time
Runnin' through the stop sign like I’m livin' for the highlights

[Pre-Hook]
I ain’t proud of all of it (All right!)
But I’d do it all again (All right!)
'Cause it’s all been hella fun
I can’t give a fuck I’m just livin' like, "So what?"

[Hook]
I live a life of leisure
Full of guilty pleasure
I can’t give a fuck I’m just livin’ like, "So what?"
It couldn’t get much better
Only guilty pleasure
I can’t give a fuck I’m just livin’ like, "So what?"

[Bridge]
Frankly, it’s a bad road
Ain’t no and’s or if’s about it
I don’t wanna live without it though
So join me at the carnival
All legends die young, so we'll live it how we want
Go!
All legends die young, so we'll live it how we want
Go!
All legends die young, so we'll live it how we want
Go!

[Hook]
I live a life of leisure
Full of guilty pleasure
I can’t give a fuck I’m just livin’ like, "So what?"
It couldn’t get much better
Only guilty pleasure
I can’t give a fuck I’m just livin’ like, "So what?"
(Ey!)
I live a life of leisure
Full of guilty pleasure
I can’t give a fuck I’m just livin’ like, "So what?"
