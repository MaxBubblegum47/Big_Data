All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I went for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A
Oh, California Dreamin'
On such a winter's day, hey
I went into a church
I stopped along the way
Well, I got down on my, on my, on my bended knees
And I began to pray
You know the preacher did succumb
He knows I'm going to stay
Yes he knows cause I told him so
Oh, California dreamin'
On such a winter's day, yeah
Well baby, all the leaves, the leaves, the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
Oh, I went for a walk
On a winter's day
