[Verse 1: Jared Leto & 
Halsey
]
You are insane, my desire
A violent daydream, love, love
You are crazy, a perfect liar
Said
 you'd save me, love, love

[Pre-Chorus: Jared Leto & Halsey]
I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
I'd have to swallow all your lies

[Chorus: Jared Leto & 
Halsey
]
I never said that I would be your lover
I never said that I would be your friend
I never said that I would take no other, 
be your lover
Never said

[Verse 2: Halsey & 
Jared Leto
]
You are insane, my desire
A dangerous game, love, love
You are crazy, perfect liar
Simply save me, love, love

[Pre-Chorus: Jared Leto & Halsey]
I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
I'd have to swallow all your lies

[Chorus: Halsey & 
Jared Leto
]
I never said that I would be your lover
I never said that I would be your friend
I never said that I would take no other, 
be your lover
Never said
Oh, woah, no, oh, no, woah
Love is madness

[Bridge: Jared Leto & 
Halsey
]
I knew the moment
I knew the moment
I knew the moment
Love is madness
I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
Love is madness
Oh, whoa

[Chorus: Jared Leto & 
Halsey
]
I never said that I would be your lover
I never said that I would be your friend
I never said that I would take no other, 
be your lover
Never said
Oh, woah, no, oh, no, woah
Love is madness
Love is madness
