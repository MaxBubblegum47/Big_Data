[Intro]
Uh huh, Rob Got Beats on the beat
We Ready? Yeah
Man this like one of my favorite Beyonce songs, man
What up though, Bey? Yeah
Sean Don

[Verse]
Man, this one for the ones who hold me down so we forever on the rise
Long as I got charts, it's never me, myself & I
Straight up, champagne
Man this one for the ones who cop the album and they ain't need a receipt
All the internet plumbers, you know looking for the leaks
Been trying to find middle ground, like yellow lines in the street
This show is just getting started, don't worry man take a seat
I got mom and bro around like whats better than the family
Did a show at House of Blues that shit was better than the Grammy's
On the phone with my dad trying to handle whats out of hand
Reminiscing we used to play 5-on-5, no hand to hands (ballin)
Funny man what all those times meant to us
Girls ask me why they call me big, that shit ambiguous
Rappers who was killin shit, lately I can't feel that shit
Ya'll used to didn't feel my shit and now ya'll like "you hear this shit?"
Detroit niggas, say whats up doe, where I be
Fresh as my nigga IB, what up to Don C
The most improved player, watch me turn that I to a V
On my third LP but by the time its IV
That's the fourth, don't be surprised if I'm in first with high leads
We came a long way from having hands together like God Please
Do I really gotta emphasize, my mind spaced out
Yeah I call that bitch the enterprise
I hop up on the song with Em, Jay, and K, watch me hold my own
Bitch it's Sean
Verses standing out like it close at 10 o'clock and its 10:05
Oh boy, I spit that spiritual
Yeah I'm the underdog but Underdog was a superhero too
And my city going through hell, they need a miracle too
You're more about showing off, I'm more about show and prove
Ya'll braggin about so and so, like "Oh, he really it?
The new nigga in rap? Well, can he really spit?"
Or do he just hide behind his skits like half of these rappers do
And then ya'll fucking go and praise him and his bitch like they savior of this shit
I'm like "Aw, man. Here we go"
I'm not the same man I was a year ago
I learned that life could be a merry-go
Moving at a stand still is the scenario
I also learned some girls can fit the stereotype if they got a stereo
Crazy what a cold bitch'll do for palm trees
Type that can't hold my hand even if they palm read
Got a good girl at home, yeah that's all me
I gave my number out on the outro I'm like "call me", real nigga
Since they cut my umbilical, I pass weed in my physical
Yeah my woman is vegan, she got my ass trying different food
I got her listenin to music that she wouldn't listen to
Got her vibin to Nas, she like "Man, This what I been missin, boo?"
I'ma do what I didn't do, all the ridicule is just fuel
I'ma take this little profit, I gotta flip it, no reciprocal
Nigga, fuck open arms, nigga open the safe
Respect in this bitch like  a gun on my waist
Rappin like I got a gun in my face
I treat my life like I be runnin a race
Supa Dupa flow, up up and away
You at the top, well I'm on the way
I'ma come for your spot then I cum in your face
I been trying to make I gotta have it to a habit
Addicted to the mathematics, I'ma add-it addict
Beware of the niggas who abandon when your shit was abandoned
But there for the mansion
Then hit after hit after hit
Somebody tell me what's the fuckin batting average
Dark Sky Paradise, you niggas can have it
Clique rainin so hard, you can white water raft it

[Outro]
Man, we just fucking around, man
Just off the top, on the spot, just fuckin around
We was in three different cities today, man
Shout out to my old team
Man, we been going hard as fuck
My nigga Xeno, Mike Carcen, DJ Mo Beats, waddup doe
Amir, Key Wayne, Earl Mac, Dark Sky Paradise shit man
Boogie waddup doe
Hey the album out tomorrow, man I can't believe this shit
I can't believe it
Hey waddup doe Detroit
Man waddup doe to my family, my friends, my fans
I do this for ya'll
We put our hearts into this shit
My boys damn near gone
I don't know its like 5 in the morning
We ain't slept in fuckin days
We do this from the heart man
And we did out our way
Boss up, it's time to get it, yeah
Countin blessings over money
Straight up
