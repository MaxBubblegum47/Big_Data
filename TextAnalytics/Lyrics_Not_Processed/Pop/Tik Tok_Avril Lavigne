[Verse 1]
Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like P-Diddy (Hey what's up girl)
Grab ma glasses I'm out the door I'm gonna hit the city (Let's go)
Before I leave brush ma teeth with a bottle of Jack
Cause when I leave for the night I ain't coming back

[Verse 2]
I'm taking pedicure on our toes toes
Trying on all our clothe’s clothe’s
Boys blowing' up our phones phones

Drop top and playing our favorite CD's
Goin up to the parties
Tryna get a little bit tipsy

[Chorus]
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Im'ma fight
Til we see the sunlight
TiK ToK, on the clock
But the party don't stop no
Woah-oh oh oh
Woah-oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
Now, the dudes are lining up cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

[Verse 4]
I'm talking' bout - everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys tryna touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk
Now, now - we goin' til they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
PO-PO shut us - (down) -man

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me
With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me

[Verse 5]
You build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me
With my hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Now, the party don't start till I walk in

[Chorus][2X]
