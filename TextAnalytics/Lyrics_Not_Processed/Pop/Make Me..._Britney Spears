[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Friday
I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we burning bright when we cut the light
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears & 
G-Eazy
]
Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, yeah, Eazy

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or a little bar
Itâ€™s really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there are changes coming
See, I can tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go
 (Go)
Like Penelope in 
Blow
Well aware that stealing you is a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

[Bridge: G-Eazy]
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

[Chorus: Britney Spears & (G-Eazy)]
And make me oooh (Move), oooh, oooh (Yeah), oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears]
Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, you make me oooh
