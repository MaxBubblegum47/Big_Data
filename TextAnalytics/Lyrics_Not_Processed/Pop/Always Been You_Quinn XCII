[Intro]
No one even cares

[Verse 1]
Tell my friends that I don't need you
Last time we spoke was spring break in that see-through
Conversation we had in the ocean with them waves
Brought me down, down, down
I need you more than I need me
Turned 25, and I feel that I'm peaking
You're in Detroit, when I call you, you're sleeping
That's bringing me down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I wasting my breath?
You're not even upset

[Chorus]
When's the last time that you called me just to say hi?
Claiming that you don't remember things that I said to you
Acting all sly, sly
Am I supposed to say that I'm thriving?
That I got girls on the side? 'Cause I don't
It's always been you
Yeah, I don't
It's always been you

[Verse 2]
Message you, but it's a typo
Telling your friends that I'm acting all psycho
Got my attention when you call me Mikael
That's bringing me down, down, down
Remember nights when you undressed
Valley to Venice, top down with your sundress
Then I say one thing that makes you so upset
That brings you down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I wasting my breath?
You're not even upset

[Chorus]
When's the last time that you called me just to say hi?
Claiming that you don't remember things that I said to you
Acting all sly, sly
Am I supposed to say that I'm thriving?
That I got girls on the side? 'Cause I don't
It's always been you
Yeah, I don't
It's always been you

[Bridge]
For some reason, you don't think
That you're the one for me, for me
For some reason, you don't think
That you're the one for me, for me

[Chorus]
When's the last time that you called me just to say hi? (Just to say hi?)
Claiming that you don't remember things that I said to you
Acting all sly, sly (Acting all sly)
Am I supposed to say that I'm thriving?
That I got girls on the side? 'Cause I don't (I don't)
It's always been you
Yeah, I don't
It's always been you
