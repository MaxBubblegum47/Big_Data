[Intro]
Woah
Aye aye aye ayeyayyayeaye
She like, Is you singing or rapping?
And I'm like, Listen to me

[Verse 1]
Wish I was all in your mind, pay no attention
You don't check notification less you mention
But I miss you and I tell you all the time
Bet I leave you ass alone you wanna cry
And tell me how it makes sense, for you to be all alone
Tell me how it makes sense for you working jus go home
Never being truthful, so that nigga took your hoe
Wash it all away, Let me be yo soouull

[Hook]
Girl roll the weed lemme take off all your stress
Lay it down, lemme see how far you stretch
Grab a towel, cuz we might make a mess
Don't answer calls while you here, I tell em you was never here
We all allooonee, looneee, loonee, lonee
Cuz we all allooonee, looneee, loonee, lonee
Aye woah

[Verse 2]
Not for long, cuz if I leave yo friends gon ask you questions
Won't go wrong, cuz if I stay you jus a natural blessing
And my flows is on the mili, like a natural weapon
Want me leave, but if I leave then you gon learn your lesson
Having hard times, choosing buhtween both
Only got one letter, so that's all she wrote
But she gives me things when a nigga touch down
Never really thought about it till now
How she put, everybody
I don't needa gotta go, everybody but me
And uh nigga can't ride, back up from the car
Everybody but me
And it, might be a little really is a lot, everybody gon see
That you had a long day at work
So bae tell me what happened first

[Hook]
Girl roll the weed lemme take off all your stress
Lay it down, lemme see how far you stretch
Grab a towel, cuz we might make a mess
Don't answer calls while you here, I tell em you was never here
We all allooonee, looneee, loonee, lonee
Cuz we all allooonee, looneee, loonee, lonee
(woahohwoah
Loneoh oh oh oh)
