[Verse 1]
If it's a Monday
Or Friday night
If it's a highway
Or a long red light
And that dashboard clock
Just crossed midnight
And I just crossed your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
If you get to wondering
If I'm all alone
If I'm 'bout to go out
If I'm staying home
Baby, don't hesitate
Go on and pick up the phone
No matter what time it is

[Chorus]
You ain't gonna wake me up
Call me up when you're lonely
You ain't gonna wake me up
Cause I'm up and I'm only
Thinkin' about waking up with you
I miss you, I wish you'd
Come on and drive me crazy
It ain't ever too late baby
You ain't gonna wake me up
You ain't gonna wake me up

[Verse 2]
I might be drinking
At a bar down the street
I might be listening
To some song on repeat
I might be in my bed
But I won't be asleep
Don't you worry 'bout me

[Pre-Chorus]
If you get to wondering
If I'm all alone
If I'm 'bout to go out
If I'm staying home
Baby, don't hesitate
Go on and pick up that phone
No matter what time it is

[Chorus]
You ain't gonna wake me up
Call me up when you're lonely
You ain't gonna wake me up
Cause I'm up and I'm only
Thinkin' about waking up with you
I miss you, I wish you'd
Come on and drive me crazy
It ain't ever too late baby
You ain't gonna wake me up
(Up call me up, call me up)
(Up call me up, call me up)
Nope
You ain't gonna wake me

[Bridge]
1, 2, 3 in the morning
No I don't need any warning
Just show up
Just blow up my phone
Don't worry 'bout me
Cause you know

[Chorus]
You ain't gonna wake me up
Call me up when you're lonely
You ain't gonna wake me up
Cause I'm up and I'm only
Thinkin' about waking up with you
I miss you
Come on and drive me crazy
It ain't ever too late baby
You ain't gonna wake me up
Call me up when you're lonely
You ain't gonna wake me up
Cause I'm up and I'm only
Thinkin' about waking up with you
I miss you, I wish you'd
Come on and drive me crazy
It ain't ever too late baby
You ain't gonna wake me up
You ain't gonna wake me up
You ain't gonna wake me up
No, no
Oh

[Outro]
1, 2, 3 in the morning
