[Skit: Mommy]
That is my greatest fear
That if, if I lost control
Or did not h
a
ve control, things would just, you know
I would beâ€¦ fatal

[Verse 1]
I'm writing this letter to let you know I'm really leaving
And no, I'm not keeping your shit
Heard you got some new homies
Got some new hobbies
Even a new ho too
Maybe she can come help you
Maybe she can come lay do after we're done
What's done is done
I don't want nothing else to do with it
Let me tell you a secret
I've been secretly banging your homeboy
Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?
Why am I so easy to forget like that?
It can't be that easy for you to get like that
Oh no, she didn't, ooh yes, I did
Oh no, she didn't, I'll do it again

[Chorus]
Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, but I need you

[Verse 2]
Ooh, just get a load of them, they got chemistry
All they could say, we like brother and sister
Look so good together
Bet they fuckin' for real, and they was right
That's why I stayed with ya, the, the dick was too good
It made me feel good for temporary love
You was a temporary lover

[Chorus]
Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe
If you see it in me, see it in me, see it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, but I need you
