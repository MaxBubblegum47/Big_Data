[Intro: DaBaby]

Let's go

[Chorus: DaBaby]
They wanna know if he can rap, I tell 'em, "Really"
Tell my bitches, "Call me Meek" 'cause I done finally got a milli' (Let's go)
You know how bitches like to act when they get pretty
Like to turn a nigga down, that's how I act when I get jiggy
Fuck around and tell her, "No," I wanna fuck the bitch that's with ya (Huh?)
We out of Backwoods, shit, fuck it, get a Swisher
Smoke a blunt, don't do no other drugs, turn up, go get some liquor
And I know I look good, so take your picture, nigga

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
Ayy, bae, I know that I look good, you ain't gotta cap
It ain't my birthday, but I wish a nigga would, I ain't gotta rap
Blow out a candle on her booty, that's that cake, she make it clap
She make it shake, we at the shack, she tryna break a nigga's back
Yeah, I skipped class, when I was a jit with no hall pass (Dropped)
And I'll drop dick, I pick it up, then I haul ass
She say she wanna fuck, she don't wanna take a picture (Okay)
Her pussy NyQuil, I go to sleep every time I hit her
Don't know the password, so that ain't me if they respond on my Twitter
I got that hot shit, these niggas gotta go rewind it to hear it
They know I pop shit, I'll pop a nigga right now, they know I'm with it
And I only fuck with bitches if they're pretty

[Chorus: DaBaby & 
Stunna 4 Vegas

They wanna know if he can rap, I tell 'em, "Really"
Tell my bitches, "Call me Meek" 'cause I done finally got a milli' (Let's go)
You know how bitches like to act when they get pretty
Like to turn a nigga down, that's how I act when I get jiggy
Fuck around and tell her, "No," I wanna fuck the bitch that's with ya (Huh?)
We out of Backwoods, shit, fuck it, get a Swisher
Smoke a blunt, don't do no other drugs, turn up, go get some liquor
And I know I look good, so take your picture
It's 
4X
, nigga

[Verse 2: Stunna 4 Vegas]
They wanna know if he can spit for real (Uh)
He think I'm cappin', he think I can't get him killed for real (Okay)
Ayy, try your luck, I'll drop some chip and get you zipped for real (Ayy, get him outta here)
A couple racks ain't shit, bitch, I signed for a couple mil' (On gang)
Oh, really?
I send shit up like I popped a wheelie
Got rich like Roddy, I stood on that block like Meek Milly (Rich)
Red rag, blue faces, you know my pockets Crippin'
I pop tags and drop bags, you play they poppa, nigga (Ayy, bitch)
All my neighbors white folks, they be thinkin' I'm a dealer
It's 4X, I kill the beat 'cause I signed to a killer
And I know she want me 'cause I'm a young rich nigga
And I can't beef with you if you can't show me six figures, on gang

[Chorus: DaBaby]
They wanna know if he can rap, I tell 'em, "Really"
Tell my bitches, "Call me Meek" 'cause I done finally got a milli' (Let's go)
You know how bitches like to act when they get pretty
Like to turn a nigga down, that's how I act when I get jiggy
Fuck around and tell her, "No," I wanna fuck the bitch that's with ya (Huh?)

Smoke a blunt, don't do no other drugs, turn up, go get some liquor
And I know I look good, so take your picture, nigga
