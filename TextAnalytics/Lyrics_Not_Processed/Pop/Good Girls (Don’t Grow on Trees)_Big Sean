[Bridge 1: Big Sean]
When good girls gone bad they gone forever
But if she gone with me than she gone for better
Me without you that's the longest never
Living like sunshine man we on forever

[Hook: Cris Cab & Big Sean]
Amen, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sexing
Good girls don't grow on trees
I was out in the world just messing
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from a girl just left
Good girls don't grow on trees

[Verse 1: Cris Cab]
Look, I felt like it was yesterday
The times we had that went away
We're still young, but of course we felt a lot
Now I've been living like a villain that's been shot
I met her through a friend of mine
Who told me that this girl was fine
I picked her up and I started to figure out
There's more on the inside than on the out
(What she say, what she say)
She said don't bother me
She told me that I had to leave
I wanted her just to believe

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cris Cab]
She helped me get my world intact
She had my heart, I told her that
Now it hurts every time I think about
The very night that I started with acting out
The morning brought a painful sun
Knowing now just what I've done
She always was the better half for sure
The part of me in life that I preferred
I gave her all of me
Though I tore her up inside
We still kept the love alive
Amen!

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Cris Cab & Big Sean]
Woah, she's like a diamond out the rough
You know the good girls tainted by the bad world
The good girls hard to find
Woah, she's like H2O, can't get enough
Where are the good girls tainted by the bad world
(Hey), yo, OK

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look, top floor of the hotel suite
So connected that you know I got a motel cheap
I'm saying I know I don't deserve the Noble Peace
But damn, I don't deserve the "Go to hell" speech
Don't believe everything that you see up in a photo
When I'm with you, I wish that time could move slow-mo
The day I met your granny I dreamed about our family
And maybe one day we'll turn that coup√© into a 4-door

[Bridge 1]

[Outro: Big Sean]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If you meet a good girl, what you gonna do Cris?
Take her home, take her home, take her home
If you meet a good girl, what you gonna man?
Take her home, take her home, take her home
If you meet a good girl what you gonna do Cris?
Take her home, take her home, take her home
