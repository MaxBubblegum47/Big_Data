[Hook: Big Sean]
Yeah this was meant to be
I came in the world knowing nothing was for free
So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me
My life is the shit I guess that this was meant for me
Yeah this was meant to be
I came in the world knowing nothing was for free
So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me
My life is the shit I guess that this was meant for me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Tell a bitch to tell her friend to tell her friend to tell a ho
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter ho
Tell a bitch to tell her friend to tell her friend to tell a ho
Tell a bitch to tell her friend to tell her friend to tell a ho
Tell a bitch to tell her friend to tell her friend to tell a ho
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter ho
Stack that paper, stack it stack it stack it up some more
Give me everything I want then I'm asking for some more
I'm smoking up on that tropical jolly green, yea Galapagos
Rainbow chain and my necklace look like a pot of gold
I'm who these girls is tryna know jumping off Jeronimo
They tell me I'm the best and I ain't even trying ho
See me I'm into hoes that's into hoes
So now I'm in two hoes, real shit boy
You don't drink? more for me
We chillin out where niggas can't afford to be
Look baby girl you better act accordingly
Cause I see bout ten more of you
But sorry there's no more of me

[Hook: Big Sean]
Yeah this was meant to be
I came in the world knowing nothing was for free
So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me
My life is the shit I guess that this was meant for me
Yeah this was meant to be

So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me
My life is the shit I guess that this was meant for me

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ca-ca-ca-catch me if you can
Cause I might go from plane to whips
Cause money is hand to hand
And I be shining neck to wrist
And your girl want mouth to mouth
And I make her get neck to dick
'Cause she just want connections with a nigga that's connected
Bitch, I'm who they want see, want see
Used to tell me everything I won't be
You gon' be, fucking with piranha's and they gon' eat
But somehow I just turn the tide like laundry
Oooh, and now my life is beautiful
I'm a boss bitch you should come and grab a cubicle
Look and I remain until my funeral
Stand up nigga like I'm in front of the urinal

[Hook: Big Sean]
Yeah this was meant to be
I came in the world knowing nothing was for free
So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me
My life is the shit I guess that this was meant for me
Yeah this was meant to be
I came in the world knowing nothing was for free
So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me
My life is the shit I guess that this was meant for me
