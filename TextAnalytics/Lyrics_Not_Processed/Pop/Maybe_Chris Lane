[Verse 1]
Don't say a word, or I'll be gone
You broke me down for so long
I been going over the things I could have done
But you never loved me enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
I played your part, but it's time you said

[Chorus]
Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all

[Verse 2]
I stumbled home through the night
And as you slipped into my mind, mmm
We tried for so long, but you set the stage for the fall
My heart needs to learn that you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
I'm putting these ghosts to rest, so don't say

[Chorus]
Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
And I don't wanna hear you say that

[Chorus]
Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all
