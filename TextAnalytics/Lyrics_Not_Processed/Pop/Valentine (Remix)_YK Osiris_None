[Intro: YK Osiris]
Hehe
Oh no, no (Oh no, no)
No, no, nooo, no
But this come from the heart baby (Yeah)
I want you to know how much you meant for me (Hehe)
(Yo Kiwi, thank you bro)
So just listen, eh
This for you (No, no, nooo, no)

[Pre-Chorus: YK Osiris]
You tellin' me you love me but I know you don't (But I know you don't)
You tellin' me you want me but I want you more (But I want you more)
You want to kiss and hug me, I just want your soul (I just want you soul)
You tellin' me you need me but I need you

[Chorus: YK Osiris]
Girl I got you (Girl I got you)
But do you got me
Baby, I'd ride for you (I'd ride for you)
But would you ride for me
Baby, I would die for you (I'd die)
But would you die for me?
Look me in my eyes and see (Yeah, yeah) how much you mean to me

[Post-Chorus: YK Osiris]
You tell me that you love me (That you love me), but I know you don't
You tell me that you want me (That you want me), but I want you more
You want to kiss and hug me (Kiss and hug me), I just want your soul
You tell me that you need me (That you need me), but baby girl I need you more

[Verse: Lil Uzi Vert]
You tellin' me you love me 'cause I'm next to blow (Blow, blow)
I kicked you out my life, you miss them checks the most (Most, most)
I 'member when I dissed you and you left the show (Show, show)
Even though that girl so wrong, miss your sex the most (Uh)
Don't call me, baby, you're distraction
Had to cancel, why did this even happen
I had to take it slow 'cause I was on the fast end
I'm not gon' take you home, baby, that is your last win
I might go so deep in it, baby, I'm gon' blast in (Blast)
I cannot lie, that thing so wet, I'm losing traction (Slip)
No Texico, you know, we gettin' all that gas in (Gas)
You just was with him last week, you can't have my last name (No)

[Pre-Chorus: YK Osiris]
You tellin' me you love me but I know you don't (But I know you don't)
You tellin' me you want me but I want you more (But I want you more)
You want to kiss and hug me, I just want your soul (I just want your soul)
You tellin' me you need me but I need you

[Chorus: YK Osiris]
Girl I got you (Girl I got you)
But do you got me
Baby, I'd ride for you (I'd ride for you)
But would you ride for me
Baby, I would die for you (I'd die)
But would you die for me?
Look me in my eyes and see (Yeah, yeah) how much you mean to me

[Post-Chorus: YK Osiris]
You tellin' me that you love me (That you love me), but I know you don't
You tellin' me that you want me (That you want me), but I want you more
You want to kiss and hug me (Kiss and hug me), I just want your soul
You tellin' me you need me but baby girl I need you more

[Outro: YK Osiris]
