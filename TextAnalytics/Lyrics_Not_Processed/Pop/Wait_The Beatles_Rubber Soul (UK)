[Verse 1: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

[Chorus 1: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Verse 2: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

[Chorus 2: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

[Verse 3: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

[Chorus: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

[Verse 4: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

[Chorus: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Verse 5: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
