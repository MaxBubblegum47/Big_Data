[Verse 1: Oliver Sim, Romy Madley Croft & Both]
I watched you breathe in
And I wished you'd stop
Only for long enough
Long enough
It's hard to say

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Separate or combine
I ask you one last time
Did I hold you too tight?
Did I not let enough light in?

[Verse 3: Oliver Sim]
If a feeling appears
If your mind should sway
It's not a secret you should keep
I won't let you slip away

[Chorus: Oliver Sim, Romy Madley Croft & Both]
We used to be closer than this
We used to be closer than this
We used to get closer than this
Is it something you miss?
We used to be closer than this
We used to be closer than this
We used to get closer than this
Is it something you miss?

[Verse 4: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Winged or chained
I ask you, 'Would you have stayed?'
Did I hold you too tight?
Did I not let enough light in?
