[Verse 1]
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Verse 2]
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (Toxic)
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Outro]
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now (I think I'm ready now)
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
