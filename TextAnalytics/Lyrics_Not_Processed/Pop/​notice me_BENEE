[Verse 1: ROLE MODEL]
Talk dirty, you got your hand in my jeans (Jeans)
You're perfect, and everything in between ('Tween)
Mm, yeah, keep moaning, 'cause we're making a scene (Scene)
Keep going, until they tell us to leave (Leave)

[Chorus: ROLE MODEL]
Let's dance when we're not supposed to be
Can't stand when you're not close to me
Damn, can't believe you notice me, notice me
So let's dance when we're not supposed to be
Can't stand when you're not close to me
Damn, can't believe you notice me, you notice me

[Verse 2: BENEE]
Only thought I'd have you in my dreams
Things you say leave me feelin' weak
And those brown eyes of yours are all that I need
And you whisper that I'm all that you see

[Chorus: ROLE MODEL & BENEE]
Oh, let's dance when we're not supposed to be
Can't stand when you're not close to me
Damn, can't believe you notice me, notice me
So let's dance when we're not supposed to be
Can't stand when you're not close to me
Damn, can't believe you notice me, you notice me

[Bridge: ROLE MODEL]
And I won't let this go, never fell this hard
Always had bad luck, never got this far
Whoa (Hey!)
And I won't let this go, never fell this hard
Always had bad luck, never got this far
Whoa

[Chorus: ROLE MODEL & BENEE, 
ROLE MODEL
]
So let's dance when we're not supposed to be
Can't stand when you're not close to me
Damn, can't believe you notice me, notice me
So dance when we're not supposed to be
Can't stand when you're not close to me
Damn, can't believe you notice me, 
you notice me
