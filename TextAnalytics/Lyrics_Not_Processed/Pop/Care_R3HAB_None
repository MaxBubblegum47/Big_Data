[Verse 1]
I'm a vintage kind of love
Homicide of my heart
You've been breaking skin and slashing in
I'm the ghost of your thoughts
As you Ô¨Ågured out it all costs, he ought to be a stain
I reach to ya I reach into ya
Dead in your past, babe

[Chorus]
Now won't you put me in your shrine oh
I'm a vintage kind of love
We make the rules as we go whenever
I'm a vintage kind of soul
As you take my hand and light our trend
I'mma care for you, I'mma care for you
Cause you might kill us
I'mma care for you, I'mma care for you

[Post-Chorus]
I'mma care for you
I'mma care for you
I'mma care for you

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'mma care
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'mma care

[Verse 2]
I'm a different kinda drug
With cyanide in my lungs and toxic grub
Stop breakin in, crashin in
Stop playing the dark
You're my conductor of energy
Director of our fantasy
I lean from ya, I lean to ya
Nostalgic, sweet taste

[Chorus]
Now won't you meet me when our end comes
I'm a different kind of drug
See the world as we have it, take it
I'm a different kind of shove
As I wrap myself in a tourniquet
I'mma care for you, I'mma care for you
Cause you will kill us
I'mma care for you, I'mma care for you

[Post-Chorus]
I'mma care for you
I'mma care for you
I'mma care for you
