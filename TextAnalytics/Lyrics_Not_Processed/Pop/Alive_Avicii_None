[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
The rain can pour, the sun can shine
But I don't mind
The wounds will heal, the scars will fade
But I'm still here to live another day!
You put me down, build me up
But they fail to remember
That I am strong, no I'm not weak, I will not surrender

[Pre-Chorus]
I am a fighter
For freedom is my burning desire
Oh come on baby, let’s start the fire
With just this love to take us higher
I can feel it burning
Your love can keep me going

[Chorus]
Whether I'm down on my knees
Or if the world is on my shoulder
I am alive
I am alive

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
The wind will blow, it comes and goes
But I don’t mind
Even if the cross gets hard to bear
I’m still here to live another day!
You put me down, build me up
But they fail to remember
That I am strong, no I am not weak, I will not surrender

[Pre-Chorus]
I am a fighter
For freedom is my burning desire
Oh come on baby, let’s start the fire
With just this love to take us higher
I can feel it burning
Your love can keep me going

[Chorus]
Whether I'm down on my knees
Or if the world is on my shoulder
I am alive
I am alive
