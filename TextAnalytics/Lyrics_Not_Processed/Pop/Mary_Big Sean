Going, going, going
Oh God, what time is it? 2AM?
Let’s go!
Two cop cars, man I’m in trouble
Or maybe it’s just one, I swear I’m seeing double
I swear I’m seeing stars, are we on a shuttle?
Kiss you on the lips, we the perfect couple girl
She got me on cloud niiiine
She hotter than the sun-shine
Got me burning up the whole night
Now we’re running through the bloodshot red light
And they chasing me like woop, woop
Chasing, chasing, chasing, me like woop, woop
Chasing, chasing me like woop, woop
Chorus:
Yeah there’s something ’bout Mary got me high up
Oh yeah there’s something ’bout he way she make me light up
She make me oooh ooh, she make me ooooh ooh
Oh yeah there’s something ’bout Mary on fire
She can be my love, my number one supplier
She make me oooh ooh, she make me ooh ooh
So I got this chick, she a stress killer, everybody want her
Ain’t nobody realer, she don’t need no filler
High grade smooth, and every time you with her, she fill up the room
She got me on cloud 9, she hotter than the sunshine
Got me burnin’ up the whole night
Now we’re running through the bloodshot red light
And they chasing me like woop, woop
Chasing me like woop, woop
Chasing, chasing, chasing, me like woop, woop
Chasing, chasing me like woop, woop
Chorus:
Yeah there’s something ’bout Mary got me higher
Oh yeah there’s something ’bout he way she make me light up
She make me ooh ooh, she make me ooh ooh
Oh yeah there’s something ’bout Mary on fire
She give me the love, my number one supplier
She make me ooh ohh, she make me ooh ooh
Big Sean:
I’m going hard, I’m going dumb
I’m going in, till I’m going numb
I got a lot to say, I don’t hold my tongue
I just hold money, don’t hold me up
Rollin’ in more green than a hole in one
You got more than me, then shit, roll some
See I be off of that tree, ṗeople tell me I shouldn’t be
But early on my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to 3 girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave your girl a T-shirt, since she gave the whole crew neck
I don’t dance, I two-step
My weed’s strong, and suplex
My socks drawers all around the crib, look like we fittin' to move in
Bitch if I ain’t a G, I’m a OG
Two fingers on my joint, one to the police
Chorus:
Yeah there’s something ’bout Mary got me higher
Oh yeah there’s something ’bout he way she make me light up
She make me ooh ooh, she make me ooh ooh
Oh yeah there’s something ’bout Mary on fire
She give me the love, my number one supplier
She make me ooh ooh, she make me ooh ooh
Dev:
Miss Mary Jane, Jane, Jane
All dressed in green, green, green
Miss Mary Jane, Jane, Jane
All on my brain, brain, brain
I love, I love with all I got
I ain’t got no job, and I don’t want one
Cause I got you
Chorus:
Yeah there’s something ’bout Mary got me higher
Oh yeah there’s something ’bout he way she make me light up
She make me ooh ooh, she make me ooh ooh
Oh yeah there’s something ’bout Mary on fire
She give me the love, my number one supplier
She make me ooh ooh, she make me ooh ooh
