[Verse 1]
He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
And all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

[Chorus]
He was a skater boy, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

[Verse 2]
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

[Chorus]
He was a skater boy, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
And now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
Yeah, he was a skater boy, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
And now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

[Bridge]
Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

[Breakdown]
He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm with the skater boy, I said, "See you later, boy"
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at our studio, singing a song we wrote
About a girl you used to know
Yeah, I'm with the skater boy, I said, "See you later, boy"
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at our studio, singing a song we wrote
About the girl you used to know

[Outro]
Hey, everybody!
