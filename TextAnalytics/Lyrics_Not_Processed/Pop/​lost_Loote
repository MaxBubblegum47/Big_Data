[Chorus: Jackson Foote, Jackson Foote & Emma Lov Block]
I think my heart got lost
So tell me if you find it
I think my heart got lost
I wish it wasn't like this
Fuck, I'm sorry that we met
I guess it's just bad timing, yeah
I think my heart got lost
So tell me if you find it

[Verse 1: Jackson Foote, Jackson Foote & Emma Lov Block]
In the back of the bar, right there on the table
Near your wine glass with your lipstick
Maybe somewhere, her apartment
Next to her clothes on the carpet
Every evening, every weekend
I'll go to parties for no reason
And I'm leaving with somebody
But she'll never really know me
Ooh, baby, don't go, I'm bad at being alone
Being alone, yeah

[Chorus: Jackson Foote & Emma Lov Block]
I think my heart got lost
So tell me if you find it
I think my heart got lost
I wish it wasn't like this
Fuck, I'm sorry that we met
I guess it's just bad timing, yeah
I think my heart got lost
So tell me if you find it

[Post-Chorus: Jackson Foote & Emma Lov Block, Emma Lov Block]
Ooh, ooh
Have I told you that you're lovely?
But I'm no good, baby, trust me
Ooh, ooh
I've got nothing left to give you
I've got nothing left to give you

[Verse 2: Jackson Foote]
I wonder what it is I'm missing
I wonder if I'd ever really know the difference
I wonder how long I'll be coming up short
I wonder why I'm always falling apart
And it's so damn easy for everyone else
And I wonder why I can't get over myself
And I wonder if telling the truth might help
That I never climbed back from the place I fell down

[Chorus: Jackson Foote & Emma Lov Block, Emma Lov Block]
I think my heart got lost
So tell me if you find it
I think my heart got lost
I wish it wasn't like this
Fuck, I'm sorry that we met
I guess it's just bad timing, yeah (I guess it's just bad timing)
I think my heart got lost
So tell me if you find it (Tell me, yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Jackson Foote & Emma Lov Block, Emma Lov Block]
Ooh, ooh
Have I told you that you're lovely?
But I'm no good, baby, trust me
Ooh, ooh
I've got nothing left to give you
I've got nothing left to give you

[Outro: Jackson Foote]
I think my heart got lost
But maybe it's just hiding
I guess we'll never know if we never try it
Fuck, I'm sorry I'm a mess
You said that's how you like it
But think my heart got lost
Maybe we should find it
