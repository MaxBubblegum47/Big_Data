[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Squad, squad (ooh)
On God
Squad (hey, hey)
On God (hey)
Thank God for the squad, thank God for the squad

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Shit, I'm the bad guy now
'Cause I'ma lead the wave when the tide dies down
I be gettin' paid standin' up or laying down
I got the donkey of the day in the garage right now
And I'm talkin' horses
I am the one, I am the force
We ain't on the same page if you ain't hearin' from the sauce
I been foldin' money, doin' chores in the kitchen
Keep that twenty-twenty on me, I ain't got 20/20 vision
I don't need my flows back, I don't need my hoes back
Sound-sound-sound, nigga, soundin' out that throwback
And you know who I do it for, who I do it for

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & 
G-Eazy
]
Squad (ooh)
On God, on God
Squad, yeah, on God (no)
Squad (hey), on God
Thank God for the squad, thank God for the squad (
yeah
)
Hey (thank God for the squad, 
hey
)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
And I'm with the whole squad
Bitch, I go to work until I finish my job
Money in the states, I get money abroad
I could blow the whole bag, I could spend the whole wad
I could buy whatever, ain't no limit on cars
Black card, workin' hard just to spend it on moms
She kept the lights on when we been through hard times
You know I really mean it, I'ma say it three times
Gang, gang, gang (gang), squad, squad, squad (squad)
Put that on citas, man, I put that on God
Your money too short and I ain't talkin' bout Todd
Yeah, that's my OG, was on my first iPod
I been in this thing, seen 'em go bad
I can count my days ones all on one hand
You think they ride for you 'til there's shit on that fan
And then they switch sides real quick, Goddamn
Loyal to my soil, ten toes down
I know who sticks around when the shit goes down
At least I know now, yeah, at least I know now

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Squad
On God, on God (squad, squad, squad)
Squad, yeah, on God (no)
Squad (hey, yeah), on God
Thank God for the squad, thank God for the squad
Hey (thank God for the squad)

[Verse 3: Big Sean & 
PARTYNEXTDOOR
]
Man I put that on the (
squad
)
On God, I pray that none of this is a mirage
Blessings and dollars fallin' from the sky (sky)
My niggas stay strapped, are you ready for the ride?
Look, I put all my rivals in the dirt and my feet off in the sand
Niggas double-cross you quicker [?] with the hands
I can't trust a bitch unless she my bitch
Take a pic, post it and she might go viral with your man
Of course, I channel all my energy straight up out the source
Reminded every time I see my face upon The Source (woah, woah)
'Nother mil' comin' like the main course, graze
Boss had top salary, caps raise
Fur coats and gator suits, fuck what PETA say
I'll leave 'em outlined in chalk, but never leave a trace
On God, multiply so much, man
I can't even tell when I divide it with the dawgs
In God we trust, I'm reminded every time I count it up
Man I put that on the

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Squad
On God, on God (squad, squad, squad)
Squad, yeah, on God (no)
Squad (hey, yeah), on God
Thank God for the squad, thank God for the squad
Hey (thank God for the squad)

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Squad, on God, on God, yeah
Pull up in a Mazerati, yeah (skrrt)
Runnin' from the po', trynna block, yeah
You know who I do it for, you know who I do it for
You know who I do it for, you know who I do it for
You know who I do it for, you know who I do this for
You know who I do this for, you know who I do this for
