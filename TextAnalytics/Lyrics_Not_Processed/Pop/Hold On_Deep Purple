[Verse 1]
You're sweeter than the morning
When the sun is shining down on me
There is nothing you can say
That could make me go away you see
But you keep saying to me baby

[Chorus]
Hold on--I feel I'm getting ready
Hold on--I feel I'm rocking steady
Hold on--I'm going to make it with you woman
Hold on--You got to give me some love, give me some love

[Verse 2]
I held back before
But your love took me easily
You got the power
I knew was going to creep up on me
The more I give
Your love keeps coming on strong
Although it's mine now
I know it won't be for long
There's something in the saying
That a woman needs a little more time
I'm getting tired of waiting for you
Giving me some kind of sign

[Chorus]
Hold on--I've got to love you when I want to
Hold on--You've got to love me when I want you to
Hold on--I am not going to let you leave me baby
Hold on--No never no more

[Verse 3]
I know the game you're playing
And I guess you think I'm easily led
You think the words you're saying
Are really going through my head
I'm going to take you home
And give you all I can
I'll prove to you, baby
That really I'm a man

[Chorus]
Hold on--I know I'm feeling ready
Hold on--I know I'm rocking steady
Hold on--Guess I've made it with you woman
Hold on--I've got you giving me love

[Verse 4]
Something that you give me
Keeps me hanging on
No use me staying
There's nothing to be done
I'm going to take you home
And give you all I can
I'll prove to you woman
That really I'm a man

[Chorus]
Hold on--I only want to take you higher
Hold on--You are the root of my desire
Hold on--C'mon baby light my fire
Hold on
