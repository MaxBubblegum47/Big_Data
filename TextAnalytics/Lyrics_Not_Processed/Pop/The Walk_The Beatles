Well I know you heard of Suzy-Q
And I know you heard of the chicken too
I know you heard of the cha-cha-choo
Cause the walk is a dance that you can do
You just walk, you just walk
Oh you walk, yes you walk
Yeah you walk, it has to walk
Well I know you heard of the Texas Hop
I know you heard of the old Fox Trot
But when you do The Walk
You ride each car
You just shake your hips and close your eyes
And then you walk, yeah you walk
Then you walk, oh you walk, ah you walk
Oh yes you walk
Do the walk, boys!
[Instrumental]
Well I know you heard of the old mambo
And I know you heard of the old congo
But when you do the walk
You're startin to get close
And don't step on your partners toes!
You just walk, yeah you walk, then you walk
Yes you walk, oh you walk, just the walk
Now if you don't know what it's all about
Come to me and I'll show you how
Well do it fast, well do it slow
Then you'll know the walk everywhere you go
You can walk, and you walk, now you walk
You gonna walk, you gotta walk it
Just a walk
Just a walk
Just a walk
Just a walk
