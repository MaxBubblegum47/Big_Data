[Verse]
I remember how it all started
Feeling warm though the summer was over
And our little lives, they felt so big then
We're lonely, reaching stars at night in the big black sky
And you said to me

[Chorus]
If you love me, then say you love me
That you are mine
Hey, come on, darling, stop the hiding
Speak your mind
Woah, I loved you
But you left me speechless, then
Say if you love me, then say you love me
And you are mine

[Verse]
I remember how it all started
Feeling warm though the summer was over
And our little lives, they felt so big then
We're lonely, reaching stars at night in the big black sky
And you said to me

[Chorus]
If you love me, then say you love me
That you are mine
Hey, come on, darling, stop the hiding
Speak your mind
Woah, I loved you
But you left me speechless, then
Say if you love me, then say you love me
And you are mine

[Post-Chorus]
You left me speechless, speechless
You left me speechless
You left me speechless, speechless
You left me speechless, speechless

[Outro]
So if you love me, then say you love me
That you are mine
Hey, come on, darling
Speechless
