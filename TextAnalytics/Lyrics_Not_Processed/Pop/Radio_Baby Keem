[Verse 1]
I kiss my foreign in the fantom while I'm on the roll
I live my foreign 'cause I'm on my own
I think I'd rather get platinum while I gotta throw I'm like magic throw
While I'm on my monster flow I get it when i want to
Don't let no one control me I'm like Adió
Don't let no one control me I'm like Adió
I got lots of flows, I got stable bitches living for the foreign
Foreign when I want it baby callin' foreign goals
I think  baby it is a foreign get it anyway I want it
I got lots of flows, can you bring a friend?
Baby bring a friend now take that shit again, again

[Chorus]
What that radio, said what that radio?
Said what that radio? Said what that radio?
Said what that radio? Said what that radio?
Said what did your grandma? Said what did your momma?
Said what did your auntie? Said aye, aye, aye
