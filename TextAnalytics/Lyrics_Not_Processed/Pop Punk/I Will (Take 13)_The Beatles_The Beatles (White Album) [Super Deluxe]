[Paul McCartney] Love you forever, and for- I hardly think so!

[George Martin?] What the hell's going on?!

[John Lennon?] Well you know, gentlemen, I mean..!

[Paul McCartney] It verges from the sublime to the ridiculode!
(Well - 1, 2, 3)

[Verse 1]
Who knows how long I've loved you?
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will

[Verse 2]
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

[Bridge]
Love you forever, and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

[Verse 3]
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be to near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know, I will, I will
Da-da-da da-da
La-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
You know that it's true (Rattle them skulls)
