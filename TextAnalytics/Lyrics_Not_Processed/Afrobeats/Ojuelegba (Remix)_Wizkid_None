[Chorus: Wizkid]
I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
Oh, I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah
I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Are you feeling good tonight?
This thing got me thanking God for life
I just can't explain
I can't explain, no, no, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, it's gon' be a long long time 'fore we stop
Boy better know, they better know who make the scene pop
All I ever needed was a chance to get the team hot
Only thing I fear is a headshot or a screenshot
Pree me, dem a pree me
You know they only call me when they need me
I never go anywhere, they never see me
I'm the type to take it easy, take it easy
I took girls in the very first text I sent
I don't beg no lovers, I don't beg no friends
If you wanna link, we can link right now
Skeppy Wiz and Drake, it's a ting right now
Are you feeling good tonight

[Chorus: Wizkid]
This thing got me thanking God for life
Oh, I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah
I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah

[Verse 3: Skepta]
When I was in school, being African was a diss
Sounds like you need help saying my surname, Miss
Tried to communicate
But everyday is like another episode of Everybody Hates Chris
Ever since mum said, "Son you are a king"
I feel like Floyd when I'm stepping into the ring
Just spoke to the boy, said he's flying in with a ting
We're touching the road to celebrate another win, we're going in
Why am I repping these ends? Man I don't know
The government played roulette with my postcode
All I know is it's where my people dem are suffering
I seen it before, narrate the story as it unfolds
Dad certified the settings and my mum knows
My mind full of more bullets than your gun holds
Now I got the peng tings in the front row
Saying, "Skeppy come home, baby come home!"
Yeah, I love the sun but I respect the rain
Look forward to good times, can't forget the pain
I was the kid in school with the £10 shoes
White socks, jack-ups and the pepper grains
Said they're gonna respect me for my ambition
Rest in peace my niggas that are missing
I had to tell my story cause they'd rather show you
Black kids with flies on their faces on the television

[Bridge: Wizkid]
Eh e kira fun mummy mi o

Mon jaiye mi won ni won soro ju
Ojojumo owo n wole wa
E kira fun mummy mi o
Ojojumo lo n s’adura
Mon jaiye mi won ni won soro ju
Won ni won ni won soro ju

[Chorus: Wizkid]
I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
Oh, I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah
I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah
