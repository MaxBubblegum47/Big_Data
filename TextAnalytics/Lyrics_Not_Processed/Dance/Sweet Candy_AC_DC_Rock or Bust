[Intro]
Here she come, yeah
Doing that thing, yeah
Make the boys go wild
Yeah, sweet child

[Verse 1]
She do a dance
Slides down the pole
She turn a backflip
Make your heart roll
Caught in a spotlight
Crawls across the floor
Calls for attention
The boys yell out for more
Sweet Candy

[Chorus]
(Ca - an - dy)
Sweet Candy
(Ca - an - dy)
Sweet Candy
(Ca - an - dy)
Sweet Candy
(Ca - an - dy)
Alright, Candy

[Verse 2]
She splits the night
Selling us her charms
She glide around the pole
All naughty wrongs
She leave all the guys panting in wait, yeah
She knows just what she done
And she get it all in change
Sweet Candy

[Chorus]
(Ca - an - dy)
Sweet Candy
(Ca - an - dy)
Sweet Candy
(Ca - an - dy)
Sweet Candy
(Ca - an - dy)
I see you all like Candy

[Bridge]
There she go, yeah
Yeah

[Solo]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Sweet, sweet Candy
Sweet, sweet Candy
Sweet, sweet Candy
All night Candy
