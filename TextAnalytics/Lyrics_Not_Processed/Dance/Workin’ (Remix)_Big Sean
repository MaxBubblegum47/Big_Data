[Intro: Puff Daddy]
How you going to get another chance tomorrow
I don't hustle like that
I hustle like there's
There's not a second left
You know there's tomorrow
I'm hustlin' like there's only one more second left of this hustle

[Hook]
Don't bother me, I'm workin'
Don't bother me, I'm workin'
Don't bother me, I'm workin'
Don't bother me, I'm workin'
Don't, workin'

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Can't you see I'm on the phone
Bitch go'n don't be comin' over here with shit when I'm (workin')
Call me Mr Combs, and I'm 9 digit strong
Niggas hating on me but it's not (workin')
When I was 19, I walked in the house
And I told my momma she could stop (workin')
When you niggas used to beatbox on the block
Big and D-Rock, they was gettin' that (work in)
Then I linked up with some niggas from my hood
Who was know for puttin' that (work in)
And if your record ain't have it (take that, take that)
Nah, then your song, then your song wasn't (workin')
Ran into this young Jone, tell her come home
She askin' for a check I said, "Bitch is you (workin')
Now everytime she call I don't even pick up
I just hit her with the text like

[Hook]
Don't bother me, I'm workin'
Don't bother me, I'm workin'

Don't bother me, I'm workin'
Don't bother me, I'm workin'
(Yeah, I ain't finished, I ain't finished)
Don't, workin'

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
I do this shit for B.I.G
So if you don't like me fuck you and the building, you (work in)
If you see us in the club with CÃ®roc by the tub
We ain't have fun,  nigga we (workin')
In the DJ booth like a independent group like
"Look, this the record we (workin')"
Play this shit 100 times
If you don't we gon' be in here every single night that you (workin')
Shout out to my people with a job
I hope you don't fall asleep tomorrow when yous (workin')
I was knocking on this chick, my partner tap me on the back
I turnt around like "Nigga can't you see me, (workin')"
She a waitress or a stripper
If it's past midnight and she tell you she (workin')
And we hustle before we can play
So even on Memorial Day, my nigga

[Hook]
Don't bother me, I'm workin'
Don't bother me, I'm workin'

Don't bother me, I'm workin'
Don't, don't bother me, I'm workin' (work)
Don't bother me, I'm workin' (work)

[Verse 3: Travi$ Scott]
I can't feel my face
Will I live today?
Way too many drugs
For me to feel your love
Looking for some faith
I can't stand this place
I can't stay in this place
We can't stay in this place
Don't bother me when I'm working
Please don't bother her when she jerkin'
It goes down behind these curtains
Got to watch out cause these niggas lurkin'
Got to watch the block when making these purchase
Got to take your girl to find a new surgeon
Cause whoever designed that ass it ain't working
Order up a shot of vodka still going up
Need some blue dot in my cup
Cause this shit ain't working
No, this shit ain't working oh no no no...

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
You will fuck with the Don
I'm talking he world renowned
Every single thing right like I traveled through time
I come to your city and town
But you could not travel through mine
All I care about mom and how to get it all, all the time
And fuck with me when the card decline
Not when you call to call decline
Tell that bitch don't fall in love, fall in line
Twenty five to life ya I'm going in for real
See I'm in the field like center field
Everybody want to be the realest
Boy it ain't no nigga real as Emmett Till
Nights I would pray for real
I said my grace before I hit a mil
Ain't nobody in my business
'Cept the ones who do the business deals
Running shit even when I'm sitting still
Yeah bitch, I'm still workin'
You got it right I'm still (workin')
I call up my girl baby I can't lie this shit not (workin')
You went to sleep and woke up
And I'm still in the office a nigga been (workin')
You've been working forever
Your ass still in debt, I guess your work ain't (workin')
