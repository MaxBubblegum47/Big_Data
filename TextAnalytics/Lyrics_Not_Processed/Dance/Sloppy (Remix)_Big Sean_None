[Intro: Ray Jr.]
Sloppy, sloppy, I'm leavin' here sloppy
Sloppy, sloppy, I'm leavin' here sloppy
Sloppy, sloppy, I'm leavin' here sloppy
Came to the club sober, but I'm leavin' here sloppy

[Hook: Ray Jr.]
Sippin'- sippin' on rossi chillin' with my posse
Came to the club sober, but I'm leavin' here sloppy
Sloppy, sloppy, I'm leavin' here sloppy
Came to the club sober, but I'm leavin' here sloppy

[Verse 1: Ray Jr.]
Uh, sippin' on rossi (Hold up, this the remix)
Legit paper ballers, tell 'em play some defense
I'm Ray Jr. from the Land, I'm in the club with them bands
Damn homie, this your girl? Then why my hands in her pants?
In EC where they murk shit, I preach two 'em don't hurt shit
She ain't pregnant by me, cause I was there when she birthed it
Start bangin' that E-40, two girls with the B Mo
They ain't givin' up that kimo, I jet from 'em like Tebow
Liter of Ciroc, red cup of that rossi
Mix 'em both together and she gon' do the posse
Legit paper my team, I know them niggas got me
We never home 'em when we leave the club sloppy
And I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
While they in a big body, the top garage-y
Chopped at 'em bad ho, meet me in the lobby
Hotel rockin', hotel poppin
Shawty got that wet-wet, yeah she got that sloppy
When I leave the club, yeah you know I'm sloppy
Then I fuck your girl and make her girl watch me
She could teriyaki, shrimp shish kebob
Then she be like, "Give my sister some!"
And my belt buckle from Louis Voutton
When I walk in I tell 'em to give me some ones
And I get me a bitch and she take off my ones
But she bustin' it open, so she comin' with us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ducky Smallz]
Red Solo cup's full, I don't fuck with styro
Red Solo cup's full, I don't fuck with styro
King of this Rossi shit, check my fuckin' bio
Started on the clair then I swagged out Ohio

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Okay, pull up, pull up, I pull up clean
Swear I pop out, wow, I stand up, lean
Cause I'm throwed, still pourin' up
Takin' body shots out her double D cups
Woah, woah, West side pimpin'
Everything paid for except the bitch I'm rentin'
That's yours, sloppy, barely comprehendin'
While she top me, head up in my lap just kinda kissin' my
Lord, look at all that, what money could do
Never paid these hoes, just family induced
Slick, twistin' up my fingers with my Detroit crew
Talk stupid, now your ass is on the Detroit news(undefined)
Little bitch, yup

[Hook]
