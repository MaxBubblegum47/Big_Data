[Chorus]
Ah, ah, 'cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)

[Verse 1]
I've been down for two days
Tylenol PM ain't working
Losing track of time, babe (Insomnia)
My mind is running too fast
Shadows on the wall keep lurking
I wish that you would come back (Insomnia)

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep on hoping to find you
Reaching in between the sheets
Baby, it's only been one night
Feel like it's been like a week
Tossin' and turnin', tossin' and turnin'
Flipping the pillow, pulling the curtains
I got, I got, I got

[Chorus]
Insomnia, ah
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)
Insomnia, ah
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)

[Verse 2]
I can hear your voice now
Keeping me awake 'til morning
Can see you with the lights out (Insomnia)

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep on hoping to find you
Reaching in between the sheets
Maybe it's only been one night
Feel like it's been like a week
Tossin' and turnin', tossin' and turnin'
Flipping the pillow, pulling the curtains
Oh, I got, I got, I got (I got, I got, I got)

[Chorus]
Insomnia, ah
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)
Insomnia, ah
'Cause I can't sleep without you
No, I don't want to dream about you
Wish I had my arms wrapped around you (Insomnia)

[Outro]
I keep on hoping to find you
I'm trying and trying and trying to
You setting, you setting my mind loose
Oh, I got, I got, I got
