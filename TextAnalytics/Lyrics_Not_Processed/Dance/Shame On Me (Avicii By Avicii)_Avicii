Shame on me for loving you
But you can't deny that you've been untrue
You lie so sweet but you love to tease
You're putting out fire with your gasoline
Uh-dut-dut-dut, dut-up
Yeah!

I'm baptized and born again
I'mma raise hell till the bitter end
I'm a crazy little bitch in the first degree
Shame on you for loving me
Shame on you
Shame on you
Shame on you for loving me
Crazy little bitch in the first degree

Shame on me for loving you

Shame on me for loving you

(Oh, my, my!) That's what I get for loving you
(Lie, lie, lie!) No, I can't live without you
(Why, why, why?) And all the things you put me through
(Cry, cry, cry!) 'Cause I'll get my kicks without you

Shame on me for loving you
