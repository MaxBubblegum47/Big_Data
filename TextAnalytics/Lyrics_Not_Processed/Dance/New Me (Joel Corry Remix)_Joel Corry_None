[Intro]
It's the new-new me, it's the new me

[Verse 1]
Ella ain't here, it's the new me
Didn't have time when you knew me
Why you tryna call like booty, oh? Yeah, yeah
Take a step back and 180 (Uh)
I could play you like you played me (Yeah)
Really don't care for it lately, though, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You need to change your story, babe
Tell me you want to talk (Mm-mm)
It's not what you came here for? (Oh)
This heart is closed, that girl you know
Don't live behind that door, anymore

[Chorus]
No, Ella ain't here, it's the new me
I don't make time for your foolin'
Kinda got things to be doin'
It's the new-new me (Yeah), it's the new me
Ella ain't here for your problems (What?)
Left-right-left, keep on walkin'
Should've took care of your diamonds, oh
It's the new-new me, it's the new me (Mm-mm)

It's the new-new me
It's the new-new me, it's the new-new me
It's the new-new me
It's the new-new me, it's the new-new me
It's the new-new me
It's the new-new me, it's the new-new me
It's the new-new me
It's the new-new me, it's the new-new me

[Verse 2]
Funny you think you can come here
Man, I don't miss your assumptions (Nope)
Never did care what I wanted, oh, oh
Lemme just say you're a killjoy (Killjoy)
Lovin' that sound of your own voice (Own voice)
Think you talk smart, but it's just noise (Oh, oh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You need to change your story, babe
Tell me you want to talk
It's not what you came here for (Yeah)
This heart is closed, that girl you know (You know)
Don't live behind that door, anymore

[Chorus]
No, Ella ain't here, it's the new me (New me)
I don't make time for your foolin' (Hi)
Kinda got things to be doin'
It's the new-new me (Yeah), it's the new me
Ella ain't here for your problems (What)
Left-right-left, keep on walkin'
Should've took care of your diamonds, oh (Mm)
It's the new-new me, it's the new me

It's the new-new me
It's the new-new me, it's the new-new me
It's the new-new me
It's the new-new me, it's the new-new me
It's the new-new me
It's the new-new me, it's the new-new me
It's the new-new me
It's the new-new me, it's the new-new me

[Chorus]
Got a new phone, got a new key
Got my girlfriends and a new weave (That's right)
And I don't do what I used to (No, no)
When you call me tryna come through (Come through)
'Cause Ella ain't here, it's the new me (No, no)
How many times are you foolin' (Nah)
Kinda got things to be doin', oh
It's the new-new me, it's the new-new me

It's the new-new me
It's the new-new me, it's the new-new me
It's the new-new me
It's the new-new me, it's the new-new me
