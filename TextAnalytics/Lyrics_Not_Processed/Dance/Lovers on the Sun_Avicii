[Verse 1: Sam Martin]
Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright
We'll find a way, we'll find a way
To keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls
Into the wild side, the hunger satisfied

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

[Drop: David Guetta & Avicii]

[Verse 2: Sam Martin]
We'll never know, we'll never know
What stands behind the door
But I got a feeling
It's a feeling that's worth dying for
Just close your eyes, and hold your breath
Because it feels right
We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride!

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

[Drop: David Guetta & Avicii]

[Outro: Sam Martin]
Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
And show the world, a burning light
They've never shined so bright
