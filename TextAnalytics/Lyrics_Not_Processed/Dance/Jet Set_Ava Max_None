[Verse 1]
I was in pieces, pieces
I was the weakest, weakest
I couldn't believe it, -lieve it
I was at my lowest low
I said I would be there, be there
Oh I didn't need this, need this
I'm done with the weakness, weakness
Gotta show 'em that I'm bold

[Pre-Chorus]
You're just another voice talking off my ear
Just another enemy
I've been here before now I've got no fears
Tell 'em that I'm ready

[Chorus]
So go ahead, cause I've left
I'm jet set
No one can pull me down
No rain can't stop me
I'll fly away, watch me from the ground
Keep me with your words
They'll just bounce right back
Now it never hurts when you talk like that
So go ahead, cause I've left
I'm jet set
No one can pull me down

[Verse 2]
Now I'm a flyer, flyer
So over the fighters, fighters
They're getting me higher, higher
I just let 'em watch me coast

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another voice talking off my ear
Just another enemy
I've been here before now I've got no fears
Tell 'em that I'm ready

[Chorus]
So go ahead, cause I've left
I'm jet set
No one can pull me down
No rain can't stop me
I'll fly away, watch me from the ground
Keep me with your words
They'll just bounce right back
Now it never hurts when you talk like that
So go ahead, cause I've left
I'm jet set
No one can pull me down

[Bridge]
No one can pull me down
Holding on, holding on
Something is missing
Holding on, holding on
The rest is unwritten

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another voice talking off my ear
Just another enemy
I've been here before now I've got no fears
Tell 'em that I'm ready

[Chorus]
So go ahead (go ahead) cause I've left
I'm jet set
No one can pull me down
No rain can't stop me
I fly away, watch me from the ground
Keep me with your words
They'll just bounce right back (bounce right back)
Now it never hurts when you talk like that (talk like that)
So go ahead, cause I've left
I'm jet set
No one can pull me down

[Outro]
No, no
No one can pull me down
(No one can pull me down)
No one can pull me down
No one can pull me down (no)
No one can pull me down
