[Verse 1]
I've been watching you, you've been hurting too
You give all your love, nothing left to show
I have been there too, alone in my despair
Watching life go by, no one who to share
Boy, you got it bad, but I got something good
I will treat you good in every way, yeah
You will never feel alone, my touch is such a rush
It overflows

[Chorus]
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I will give to you the love you seek and more
You're what I'm waiting for
I will give to you the love you seek and more
You're all I really need
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more

[Verse 2]
Baby, here we are, standing face to face
Just the two of us, locked in your embrace
Now I got it bad, but you got something good
Won't you treat me good in every way? Yeah
Are you ready? I can feel your passion and your love
It overflows

[Chorus]
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more

[Bridge]
I got the love you seek
I got the love you seek
I got the love you seek
I got the love

[Chorus]
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more
(The love you seek, baby)
I will give to you the love you seek and more
You're what I'm waiting for baby
I will give to you the love you seek and more
