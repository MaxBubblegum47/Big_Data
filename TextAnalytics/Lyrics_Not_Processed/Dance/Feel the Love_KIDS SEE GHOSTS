[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
Feel the love

[Verse: Pusha-T, Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
We not worried 'bout no other niggas, we them other niggas
You bust down a Rollie, I bust down a brick, then I flood it, nigga
I am not to be compared to you rappers, Eazy-Duz-It, nigga
I am more Eazy, you tryin’ your best to become me, nigga
She like them bottles with bubbles in it
Buy her Loewe and other linen
Why would I wait when there's other women?
Why would I hate? We in love with winnin' (Ooh!)
Buy her bundles, fly her out, bring her friend, I try her out
Ain’t no worries findin' out, the details is ironed out
Easily they plays along, hopin' that I play a song
Love to fuck to trap music (Feel the love)
Grrrat-gat-gat-gat-gat
Dope money just came along (Woo)

[Chorus 1: Kanye West & Kid Cudi]
Grrrat-gat (I can still feel the love)
Gat-gat, gat, ga-ga-ga-ga-gat
Grrrat, gat-gat-gat (I can still feel the love)
Gat-gat-gat-gat-gat-gat-gat, grrrat
Gat-gat-gat-gat (Feel the love)
