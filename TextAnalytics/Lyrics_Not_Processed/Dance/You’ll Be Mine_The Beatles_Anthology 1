[Verse 1]
Well the stars, always shine
You'll be mine, and I know
You'll be mine
How they shine
You'll be mine

[Chorus]
As the stars (as the stars)
Always shine (always shine)
You'll be mine (you'll be mine)
You'll be mine
And the stars (and the stars)
Always shine (always shine)
You'll be mine
Now, ah, ah, ah, ah...

[Verse 2]
(My darling
When you brought me that toast the other morning
I, I looked into you eyes
And I could see that National Health eyeball
And I loved you, like I've never done
Like I've never done before!)

[Chorus]
Well the stars (well the stars)
They shine (oh, they shine)
And you'll be mine
Oh, you will be mine
You'll be mine
At the star (at the star)
Always shining
