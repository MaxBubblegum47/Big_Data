[Verse 1: The Game & (Chris Brown)]
Step out the door and I'm rollin slow motion
I'm finna get down with my G's
Look 'round the crib and then pick up my keys
Hop in the Fo', then go so niggas don't know
I'm puffin on that reefer
That chronic that grow from the trees
And now we smokin, throwin' up B's
And I got Bone Thugs on my team
You know we steadily drinkin' that liquor
Walk off in the club say wassup to my niggas and
I'm stumbilin' into that hydro
Look-at-me eyes
 low with a pyro
Smokin the same in Indonesia, and Cairo
I'm back to back in them blunts
Now where-did-me light go
Before I get psycho, lets get high bro
Sitting and choppin' with Krayzie
Stuffin that haze inside-a-me swisha man
Layzie, Flesh, Wish
And never forgetting my nigga Bizzy and
Aimin' slow on Mr. Ouija
Better know who the boss
You don't wanna get tossed in the river man
,
East 99, on the grind, it's feel the same
(Put the purp in the blunt)

[Verse 2: Wish Bone]
Got a call from Compton
Celebratin' real niggas so you know that I'm comin'
Laced up
Little bit of sun, little bit of fun
They got love in Compton for Bone
Little Hennessy
A little Cali green
I'm floatin', chokin'
I'm gone
Look for something to poke on
I'm so high, got my Loc on
But I'm so real
Life is so chill
I'm a grown man
Nigga, fo' real
It's mine (mine)
'Cause I'm spendin'
Keep my hustle on so Ima get it
I'm in my own lane
Nigga pay tolls
Nigga no change, if anything
Betta have mine
Before the party stops
Nigga gun range
Bop, bop, bop

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Well I'm in the back with a blunt
Steady get it in
First to the last of the month
Every time a nigga say
I don't smoke weed no mo'
I Smell it, then I say pass the bong
We having a celebration
So gone I don't even know what the occasion is
Can't even remember my name and shit
Man look at what this nigga Game done did
This nigga done made me relapse on a weed track
Put some purp in the blunt 'cause need that,.
Drink a 40 on my own in the zone
Still I won't get feedback
Know the haters wanna see me
For the love, a nigga bustin'
So I'm feelin' like I'm runnin' with the devil
Everybody got the level when a nigga got me ready to roll
And Hydro got me ready to blow
Split that swisha
Roll some mo'
If yall niggas ain't know Bone can smoke
Highly, highly, high
But on the lowly, lowly, low
Tell me what they want
A little bit of Bone
With a little bit of Game
Still the same
Thugs swang
Haters can hate if they want
For me, It's still a wonderful day!!

[Verse 4: Flesh-N-Bone]
Hit 'em off the top like on the block
It look like he just seen a ghost
Got a 100 kids floating around in my hood
And we going for broke
Hit the weed and the blunts, lil bro
And roll up some smoke
Get 36 of that OG
If it's potent, tell 'em run the whole key
All my niggas down in the land getting that GWAP
Hustlin', eatin', getting no sleep
From Cleveland to Cali
We runnin' man
Wit' Game man
We Chiefin' man
It's the 1st of tha month and we yawnin'
That's my everyday agenda
Red Strings
Bigger heaters
Five Thugs-N-Harmony members

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high

[Verse 5: Layzie Bone]
My life is a movie
It's just like a party
I wake up and roll up and blow on that Maui
Wow-eee
Early in the morning, the room is still cloudy
All night long
My thugs is just rowdy
All we do it for a celebration
We celebrate life in the fast lane
And never we hesitate
Only we demonstrate
Original cash game
Mix it up with the hash, man
I might let you hit it
But never do ask, man
That miracle, lyrical, Mary-jay-wanna my sponsor
That's why I don't have pain
L-Burna gon' have thangs
My mission is music
Foe tha love of tha money
Always reppin' that Eazy-E
,
What he gave me
You can't take that from me
,
B-O-N-E, to the T-H-U-G
To the G-A-M-E
Got the game on lock
Lock, lock, lock, lock
But rock it, don't stop
Party over here
Better call the cops, (Cuz it's hot)
The buddha keep penetratin'
We celebratin'
Real niggas made it
No longer me-need-a-me hair braided
Just chiefin' in my Wahoo
Faded, Faded!

[Verse 6: Bizzy Bone]
We havin' a celebration
Love to stay high
Out of my Khakis
Out of my Gucci
And I'm gonna roll something, when I roll
When I roll that "OOOO-WEEE," Hey
Let me put it back
Gotta love that
Put it out?
Fuck that!
Little Henny on the side in the ride
Better make it alright
Not much time lookin' back
Better handle my business here
Puff-Puff, Pass
And my last
Gotta leave a little baggy in the air
Gotta put a little love in the glass
My legendary, level-headed peers
Grab a buckle when I buck 'em with a beer
Sell the doe from the back of the stairs
That's when it was Clair, (Clair, clair....)
But thanks to Game and this life
To keep Hip-Hop alive for the ones alive
And even my niggas that's dead and gone
Everytime in smoke
And it's like them niggas still live on
Hustlin', I still do it
Celebrate and elevate your mind
Little Bizzy gotta keep it movin'
Everybody on the 1st still high (high, high, high....)

[Interlude: Game & (Chris Brown)]
Jesus Piece, December 11
We celebrating the birth, death
And the resurrection of the Black Jesus
But until then...
(Put the purp in the blunt)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
