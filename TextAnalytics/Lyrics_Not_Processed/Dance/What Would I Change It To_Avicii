[Verse 1]
Steady yourself even though you know that you're falling
Maybe you're falling, but you're still alive
Ready yourself, that's quite enough of your bawlin'
'Cause baby, you're bawling, but you'll survive
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

[Chorus]
Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
You can copy and paste your head on a new body
But that new body's still made of flesh
And cutting corners gets you where you're going
But how you get there is the real test

[Pre-Chorus]
And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

[Chorus]
Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
