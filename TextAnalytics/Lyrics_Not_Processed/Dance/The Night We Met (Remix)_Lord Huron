[Verse 1: Ben Schneider]
I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

[Verse 2: Ben Schneider & Phoebe Bridgers]
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

[Chorus: Ben Schneider & Phoebe Bridgers]
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

[Chorus: Ben Schneider & Phoebe Bridgers]
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met
