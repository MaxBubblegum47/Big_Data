[Verse 1]
We were so bright
Standing in the sunlight
Never got burnt, we were alright
Had that easy kind of love and I let it in
For a moment
Felt like we were floating
Baby, I swear, we were golden
It was easy, natural as breathing air

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the sky went dark
You think I would have known
Before we let it get this far
I should have let you go

[Chorus]
Now I gotta crawl outta love
Now I gotta crawl outta love
It's so fucking easy to fall in
But now that this ain't what you promised
And tell me how to crawl outta love

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me how to–
Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love
Tell me how to–
Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love

[Verse 2]
Got your words right
Always knew what to say in our fights
Look at us now, hard as I try
I get halfway up the wall and you pull me down

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the sky went dark
You think I would have known
Before we let it get this far
I should have let you go

[Chorus]
Now I gotta crawl outta love
Now I gotta crawl outta love
It's so fucking easy to fall in
But now that this ain't what you promised
Tell me how to crawl outta love

[Post-Chorus]
Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love
Tell me how to–
Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love

[Bridge]
Crawl outta, crawl outta
Crawl outta, crawl outta love
Crawl outta, crawl outta
And when the sky went dark
You think I would have known
Before we let it get this far
I should have let you go

[Chorus]
Now I gotta crawl outta love
Now I gotta crawl outta love
It's so fucking easy to fall in
But now that this ain't what you promised
Tell me how to crawl outta love

[Post-Chorus]
Now I gotta–
Tell me how to crawl outta, crawl outta love
Tell me how to–
Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love
