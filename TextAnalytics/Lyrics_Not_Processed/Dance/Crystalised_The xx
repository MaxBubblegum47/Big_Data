[Verse 1: Oliver]
You've applied the pressure
To have me crystalised
And you've got the faith
That I could bring paradise

[Verse 2: Romy]
I'll forgive and forget
Before I'm paralysed
Do I have to keep up the pace
To keep you satisfied?

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver & Both]
Things have gotten closer to the sun
And I've done things in small doses
So don't think that I'm pushing you away
When you're the one that I've kept closest

[Chorus: Both]
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh

[Verse 3: Romy]
You don't move slow
Taking steps in my direction
The sound resounds, echo
Does it lessen your affection? No

[Verse 4: Oliver]
You say I'm foolish
For pushing this aside
But burn down our home
I won't leave alive

[Pre-Chorus: Romy & Both]
Glaciers have melted to the sea
I wish the tide would take me over
I've been down on my knees
And you just keep on getting closer

[Chorus: Romy & Oliver]
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh

[Bridge: Romy & Oliver]
Glaciers have melted to the sea
(Things have gotten closer to the sun)
I wish the tide would take me over
(And I've done things in small doses)
I've been down onto my knees
(So don't think that I'm pushing you away)
And you just keep on getting closer
(When you're the one that I've kept closest)

[Outro: Romy & Oliver]
Go slow
Go slow
Go slow
Go slow
Go slow
