Baby I'm hypnotized
You got me mesmerized
I need one dance with you
Tell me what you like
I promise I won't bite baby
Is that booty real?
I love the way it feels
I got that hood dick
You need a thug in your life
Good dick could fuck up life
Got money falling from the ceiling
Give me a drink, big bottle tonight
Let's play truth or dare
Take off your underwear
Show me what's under there
Take that to the bedroom
Let me freak-a-leak
Let's get freak-a-leak
Any day of the week and let me freak-a-leak
Baby I'm hypnotized
You got me mesmerized
I need one dance with you
Tell me what you like
I promise I won't bite baby
Is your booty real
I like the way it feels
I got that hood dick
(Likybo)
Baby I can't fight the fuck, I ain't trippin off no nut
Been that nigga all my life
Now I'm tryna run it up
In your life you need a thug
It's a four four in this cup
I'm in love with the music
But fuck me and my slimes baby
You got me hypnotized from the look in your eyes baby
I'm tryna give you something you can mesmorize
Girl you thicker than a snicker I can see it in your thighs
Put this dick all in your liver if I take you home tonight
I just need like a one dance
I hand the Glock to my man
Excuse my pants kind of tight from the band's
I can take you to another land like no other nigga can
Show you how to get this money, so forget about your plans
And I promise that I...
