[Verse 1]
Feel that salt in the air, almost there
Got that wind in my hair, Ray-Ban glare
Hear that song we love on the radio
Stir it up baby, we both know

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re ‘bout to float that Malibu
With that flip-flop attitude
With that old school mixtape playing

[Chorus]
Over and over again on a blown out speaker
Dance in the sand while the sun sets deeper
Got that top back on that Jeep
Got that soundtrack on repeat
Got that one hand on my knee and I want it
Over and over again, catching summer fever
Summer fever, summer fever

[Verse 2]
Close our eyes and let it take us
Lost in the waves and the palm trees swaying
All alone and out of reach
Just the stars and the moonlight, you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re ‘bout to float that Malibu
With that barefoot attitude
With that slow jam mixtape playing

[Chorus]
Over and over again on a blown out speaker
Dance in the sand while the sun sets deeper
Got that top back on that Jeep
Got that soundtrack on repeat
Got that one hand on my knee and I want it
Over and over again, catching summer fever
Summer fever, summer fever

[Bridge]
Endless sun kissed smile on our face
Chase that love like it’s running away
And I want it
Yeah I want it
Ohh

[Chorus]
Over and over again on a blown out speaker
Dance in the sand while the sun sets deeper
Got that top back on that Jeep
Got that soundtrack on repeat
Got that one hand on my knee and I want it
Over and over again catching summer fever, summer fever, summer fever

[Outro]
Over and over again, catching summer fever
Summer fever, summer fever
