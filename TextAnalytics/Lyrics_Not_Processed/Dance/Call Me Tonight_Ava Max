[Verse 1]
Slip, slippin' on my Versace, New York party
Icy drip, drippin' on emerald snake, thank you BVLGARI
Get there quick, my chauffeur drove me back like a performer
I went straight, straight to dance and saw you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're lookin' for danger, hungry eyes
Are you sure? Are you free? Are you mine?
Looking for a stranger, fantasize
Don't let go, let me out of your sight

[Chorus]
You got me thinkin' (Eh-oh)
If you don't, don't know my name
Then, baby, you can just call me tonight (Eh-oh)
If I go, you'll go insane
Then, baby, you can just call me tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Call me tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Call me tonight
Just call me tonight

[Verse 2]
Break, break your heart in the mornin', don't you worry
And I'll fly, fly away before it's love, before you've boarded
Can't be grieving, know I'm always leaving
When the sun is beating, I beat it

[Pre-Chorus]
You're lookin' for danger, hungry eyes
Are you sure? Are you free? Are you mine?
Looking for a stranger, fantasize
Don't let go, let me out of your sight

[Chorus]
You got me thinkin' (Eh-oh)
If you don't, don't know my name
Then, baby, you can just call me tonight (Eh-oh)
If I go, you'll go insane
Then, baby, you can just call me tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Call me tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Call me tonight
Just call me tonight

[Bridge]
Empty out your hands, pour me in your glass
If you need a light, I can be your match
I glow in the dark, take you to the clouds

[Chorus]
You got me thinkin' (Eh-oh)
If you don't, don't know my name
Then, baby, you can just call me tonight (Eh-oh)
If I go, you'll go insane
Then, baby, you can just call me tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Call me tonight (Call me, babe, ooh-ooh)
Call me tonight
Just call me tonight

[Outro]
Call me tonight
