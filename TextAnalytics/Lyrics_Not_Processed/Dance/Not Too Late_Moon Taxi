[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sing
And go dance outside in the pouring rain
We lived like we would never wake up
From a dream that we shared, just the two of us

[Refrain]
But now we're tied up, bad luck
Never gonna make our minds up
Worn out and restless
Oh, I wish that we could escape

[Pre-Chorus]
We could escape
We could escape
And I'd give anything to hear you tell me

[Chorus]
It's not too late (oh woah)
It's not too late (oh woah)
It's not too late
And I'd give anything to hear you tell me
It's not too late

[Verse 2]
Always said that we would make the most
Of what we had and keep it close
Summers come and summers go
The years fly by but the days go so slow, yeah

[Refrain]
Dreaming, scheming
Always believing
So right now this is my wish
That we could escape

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd give anything to hear you tell me

[Chorus]
It's not too late (oh woah)
It's not too late (oh woah)
It's not too late
And I'd give anything to hear you tell me
It's not too late (oh woah)
It's not too late (oh woah)
It's not too late

[Bridge]
Ten years go by and everything's changed
Oh, we're different people but we got the same names
So you call it out just like you did
All the time ago when we were just kids singing
Oh (We could escape)
Oh (We could escape)
Oh, and I'd give anything to hear you tell me

[Chorus]
It's not too late (oh woah)
It's not too late (oh woah)
It's not too late
And I'd give anything to hear you tell me
It's not too late (oh woah)
It's not too late (oh woah)
It's not too late
And I'd give anything to hear you tell me
