[Verse 1]
If it feels good, what are you waiting for?
If it tastes good, you're supposed to
Have some then have some more
Moderation is for all those that were promised tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you believe
But there's one thing guaranteed
That we all got to go
So you might as well go on
And dance to your own kind of song
And don't you dare explain what for, oh
Oh

[Chorus]
Who's to say (Who's to say)
That you're wrong (That you're wrong)
That they're right
I say do your thang (Do your thang)
Let 'em hate (Let 'em hate)
Live your life, live your life, live your life
Live your life
Who's to say (Who's to say)
That you're wrong (That you're wrong)
That they're right
I say do your thang (Do your thang)
Let 'em hate (Let 'em hate)
Live your life, live your life, live your life
Live your life

[Verse 2]
If it looks good
Don't wait around no more
(Don't wait around, don't wait around)
And if you know you should, you're supposed to
Get your ass up and go
Hesitation is for all those that were promised tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you believe
But there's one thing guaranteed
That we all got to go
So you might as well go on
And dance to your own kind of song
And don't you dare explain what for, oh
Oh

[Chorus]
Who's to say (Who's to say)
That you're wrong (That you're wrong)
That they're right
I say do your thang (Do your thang)
Let 'em hate (Let 'em hate)
Live your life, live your life, live your life
Live your life
Who's to say (Who's to say)
That you're wrong (That you're wrong)
That they're right
I say do your thang (Do your thang)
Let 'em hate (Let 'em hate)
Live your life, live your life, live your life
Live your life

[Chorus]
Who's to say (Who's to say)
That you're wrong (That you're wrong)
That they're right
I say do your thang (Do your thang)
Let 'em hate (Let 'em hate)
Live your life, live your life, live your life
