[Spoken: Brit Marling & (William Mapother)]
Do you know that story of the Russian cosmonaut?
So, he goes up in this big spaceship
And he's got this portal window
And he's looking out of it
And he sees the curvature of the Earth for the first time
And all of a sudden, this strange ticking
Begins coming out of the dashboard (Okay, yeah)
But he can't find it, he can't stop it, it keeps going
A few hours into this, it begins to feel like torture
What's he gonna do? He's up in space!
So the cosmonaut decides
The only way to save his sanity
Is to fall in love with this sound
