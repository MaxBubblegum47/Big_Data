[Verse 1]
Never did I ever
Mean to make a mess
How I'm gonna get home
Is anybodyâ€™s guess
Money where your mouth was
Gonna wake up in debt
And my car ain't fixed yet

[Pre-Chorus]
Crazy stupid love
Let the the beat do what it does
Let the music lift you up
Tonight we got enough

[Chorus]
Just clap your hands now
Just clap your hands now
Just clap, clap...
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, aah
Just clap your hands now
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, aah

[Verse 2]
Never did I ever
Mean to send a text
Maybe in the morning
We can make amends
Keep on running my mouth
You keep getting obsessed
Baby, don't be upset

[Pre-Chorus]
Crazy stupid love
Let the the beat do what it does
Let the music lift you up
Tonight we got enough

[Chorus]
Just clap your hands now
Just clap your hands now
Just clap, clap...
Just clap your hands now
Just clap, clap...
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, aah
Just clap your hands now
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, aah

[Outro]
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, aah
Just clap your hands now
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, aah
Just clap your hands now
Just clap, clap...
Just clap, clap, clap...
Just clap, clap...
