[Intro]
Now greetings to the world
Voice of the one, Big Gong-Zilla alongside Skrillex
Dem fe know! Who we? Awoah!

[Hook]
We mash up the place, turn up the bass, and make them all have fun
A-we a blaze the fire, make it bun dem
We mash up the place, turn up the bass, and make some sound boy run
A-we will end your week just like a Sunday
We mash up the place, turn up the bass, and make them all have fun
Skrillex a blaze the fire, make it bun dem
We mash up the place, turn up the bass, and make some sound boy run
A-we will end your week just like a Sunday

[Chorus]
Rudeboy! Rudeboy!
Rudeboy! Rudeboy!

[Verse 1]
If I nah pose, but if I supposed
Them see we a close, them wouldn't suppose it
Killin' the flows, we're sicker than most
Defeating the foes, we weather the most
Never yet falter, never yet flop
Never yet halt and never yet stop
Keep up with God and never you drop
All 'em a talk and all 'em a chat
Skrillex and Gong, the legend lives on
We give them it hard, we give them it strong
We give them it rough, we give them it long
We give it them right, and never yet wrong
Sweeter theï»¿ vict'ry, the hotter the battle
The bigger the cover, the fatter the bottle
The bass haffi rattle, a my tabernacle dis
Rudeboy bass, mash up the place

[Chorus]
Rudeboy! Rudeboy!
Rudeboy! Rudeboy!

[Hook]
We mash up the place, turn up the bass, and make them all have fun
A-we a blaze the fire, make it bun dem
We mash up the place, turn up the bass, and make some sound boy run
A-we will end your week just like a Sunday
We mash up the place, turn up the bass, and make them all have fun
Skrillex a blaze the fire, make it bun dem
We mash up the place, turn up the bass, and make some sound boy run
A-we will end your week just like a Sunday

[Chorus]
Rudeboy! Rudeboy!
Rudeboy!
