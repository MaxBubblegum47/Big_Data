[Verse 1]
Diamonds and dust
Poor man last
Rich man first
Lamborghini's, caviar
Dry martini's, Shangri-La

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a burnin' feelin'
Deep inside of me
It's a yearning
But I'm going to set it free

[Chorus]
I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I wanna win
In sin city

Oh, let me roll you baby

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Ladders and snakes
Ladders give
Snakes take
Rich man, poor man
Beggar man, thief
Ainâ€™t got a hope in hell
That's my belief
Fingers Freddy, Diamond Jim
They're gettin' ready
Look out, I'm comin' in

[Pre-Chorus]
So spin that wheel
Cut that pack
And roll those loaded dice
Bring on the dancing girls and put the champagne on ice

[Chorus]
I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I wanna win
In sin city
