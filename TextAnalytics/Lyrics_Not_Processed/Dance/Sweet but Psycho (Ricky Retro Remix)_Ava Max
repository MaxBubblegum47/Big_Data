[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 1]
She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

[Pre-Drop]
You just can't help it
You just can't help it
No, no
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Drop]
Oh, she's sweet but a...
Oh, she's sweet but a...
Oh, she's sweet but a...

[Verse 2]
See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugarcoat it"

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No, no"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Pre-Drop]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind
I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind

[Outro]
With your head
