[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Drivin' drunk, I'm doin' my thing
Rollin' the midwest side and out
Livin' my life, gettin' out dreams
I'ma do just what I want, lookin' ahead no turnin' back
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
I'm screaming out "Fuck that", I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that, fuck that

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up, to the sky

[Chorus: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothin'
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow

[Chorus: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
