[Verse 1]
Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

[Drop]
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday, I was through with hopin'
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around

[Verse 2]
We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

[Drop]
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love
