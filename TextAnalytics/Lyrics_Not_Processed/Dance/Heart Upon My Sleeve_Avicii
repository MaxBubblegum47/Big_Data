[Chorus]
With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low and I still feel broken
And down upon my knees
With my head down low I and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
I know that I need you most and
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down
Woah

[Verse]
I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it
I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it

[Chorus]
With my heart upon my sleeve
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low I and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
I know that I need you most and
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down
