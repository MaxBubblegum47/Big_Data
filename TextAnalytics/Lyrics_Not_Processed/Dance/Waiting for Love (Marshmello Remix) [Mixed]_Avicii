[Verse]
Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul, the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer, a dream, we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday, I was through with hopin'
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around

[Post-Chorus]
Come around, come around
Come around, come around
