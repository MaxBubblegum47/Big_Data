[Verse 1: Aleesia]
See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies
See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies

[Chorus: DVBBS]
Coming up, coming down
Look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now
We will live forever
Coming up, coming down
Look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now
We will live forever
Coming up, coming down
Look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now
We will live forever
Coming up, coming down
Look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now
We will live forever

[Build: DVBBS & (Aleesia)]
Coming up! Coming up! Coming up! Coming up!
Coming up! Coming up! Coming up! Coming up!
Coming up! Coming up! Coming up! Coming up!
Coming up!
(We will forever be faded under gold skies)

[Verse 1: Aleesia]
See the smoke when the sun shines

We will forever be faded under gold skies

[Chorus: DVBBS]
Coming up, coming down
Look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now
We will live forever
Coming up, coming down
Look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now
We will live forever

Coming up! Coming up! Coming up! Coming up!
Coming up! Coming up! Coming up! Coming up!
(We will forever be faded under gold skies)

[Outro: Aleesia]
We will forever be faded under gold skies
We will forever be faded under gold skies
We will forever be faded under gold skies
