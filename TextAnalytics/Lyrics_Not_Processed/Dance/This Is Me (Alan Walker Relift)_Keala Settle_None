[Verse 1: Lettie Lutz]
I am not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
Run away, they say
No one'll love you as you are

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus: Ensemble, Both]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
This is me

[Verse 2: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble]
Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades and
Reachin' for the sun
(We are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become
(Yeah, that's what we've become)

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz & Ensemble]
I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz & Ensemble]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marchin' on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus: Lettie Lutz & Ensemble, Ensemble]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
This is me

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
This is brave, this is bruised
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble, Both]
Look out 'cause here I come
(Look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
(Marching on, marching, marching on)
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Outro: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble, Both]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, to drown them out
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
This is me
