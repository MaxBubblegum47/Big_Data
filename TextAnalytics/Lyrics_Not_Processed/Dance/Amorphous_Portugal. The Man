[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Everybody always claim they want change
But they're so wrapped up inside the pain
Chilling in the sun while they stuck in the rain
Look at my generation, nigga what a shame
Stuck inside of the molly poppin’ fumed sexual content, we need to stop it
Instead of prophets, we stuck with lost men
Instead of conscience, we stuck with nonsense
Remember them times, when they still be livin’ lies
Me and AK changing lives
Since we wasn’t in our primes
But our truth to the skies, before the coast shine
Holding on mine, we plottin’ on a rise
Tenacious with the crime, my vision super lies
Savior in the skies, I’m reading through signs
No waivers can demise
Just stop the cool drops
We savin’ niggas lives
We teachin’ them to shine
Soldier alike, now they all fall in line
Make up your mind, or get lost in the time
They can chill with pom poms
We the cream of the crop
Tell the heathen drop dom when they speakin’ to god
Never needed a nine, always guarded by light
Even that night, Issa got the clearance in sight
We ahead in the fight, while they’re tossing their knives
I get lost in the mic, ‘til the show we go right
Fuck this strap shit, my nation’s massive
Fill with passion, I paint the canvas
Niggas tragic, while we droppin’ classics
I’m goin’ savage, while more gets damaged
Started from a seed, see how awesome we blossom
I'm a warsong, go hard to save the lost ones
We the new law, think hard before you cross us
'Cause we go hard before, we're like some martians

[Chorus: Portugal. The Man + Issa Gold]
When I get up, the sun goes down
And if I never get up, it’ll come back around
All along, I don't belong
When you wake up, I'll be gone
We the new law, think hard before you cross us
'Cause we go hard before, we're like some martians
Stay in the light, head in the clouds
Stay in the light, head in the clouds
Stay in the light, head in the clouds
Stay in the light, I got my head in the clouds

[Verse 2: AK]
Wasn't too long that I escape from the struggle
From the rubble that the man done placed on my color
Cape wanna hover till the nations will suffer
Eighths to the face spark a jay every sun up
Throw the hatred away start embracing each other
Faking it won't get you greatness my brother
Trust me you gotta be sucker free
My young G against all the odds you O.D. becomes Z'd
Reflect your heart you are who you accompany
They hate us, why? 'Cause we who they wanna be
But we all wanna meet the kids of the sun
Trapped with the knowledge from within like a gun
Stand up for your rights outsmart the system
Live large and get funds your job is never done
Guided by the light the darkness can shine
My past to overcome with blackness in my lung
Trapped with the culture act, I catapult ya
Ash you like roaches AK be the cobra
Fans like oh shit when they hear the flow spit
Similar to ocean, make your brain grow shit
Know how to roll you gotta stay focus
Weak minds can't cope with all this commotion
Fake shit decoded make shifts and blow piff
If you are the future then live in the moment
Seen in my glow a nigga been chosen
To free lost souls to slow bring in motion
Heal all globe my indigo is loading
Free your dome them shows gonna erode it
Came in this realm my purpose to bring change
Puff sour and feed brains as I release pain
Own your gold and bow, we are all king
The power source is in your heart still lovin'

[Chorus: Portugal. The Man + AKTHESAVIOR]
When I get up, the sun goes down
And if I never get up, it’ll come back around
All along, I don't belong
When you wake up, I'll be gone
Own your gold and bow, we are all king
The power source in your heart still lovin'
Stay in the light, with myhead in the clouds
Stay in the light, head in the clouds
Stay in the light, head in the clouds
Stay in the light, I got my head in the clouds
