[Verse 1]
I swear I'm losing patience
For all of these fucking situations
And I swear I never say shit
But this time I'm gonna say it

[Pre-Chorus]
When the record's on the final song
And the parties will be long, long gone
All the pretenders and the hangers on
Can go find themselves another one

[Chorus]
But it ain't a thing, yeah
But it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, it ain't a thing, baby

[Verse 2]
I swear I'm losing patience (For all of these, for all of these)
All of these fucking altercations
Yeah, and I swear I never say shit (Said, never said shit, did I?)
But this time I really mean it

[Pre-Chorus]
When the record's on the final song
And the parties will be long, long gone
All the pretenders and the hangers on
Can go find themselves another one

[Chorus]
But it ain't a thing, yeah
But it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

[Post-Chorus]
It ain't a thing, baby
It ain't a thing, baby
It ain't a thing, baby

[Chorus]
But it ain't a thing, yeah
But it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

[Post-Chorus]
It ain't a thing, baby
But it ain't a thing, ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby
