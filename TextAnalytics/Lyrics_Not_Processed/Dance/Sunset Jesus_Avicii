[Verse 1: Sandro Cavazza]
Try'na set myself up for the win
Some people got a dream that's so much bigger than the town they're in
So give me love, give me love, give me peace, give me peace of mind
I know that there's an ought to a start and I need a little help with mine

[Pre-Chorus: Sandro Cavazza]
California, don't let me down
Seems so golden, but there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus, came to me
He once was a waiter, now he's a savior making money on the street

[Chorus: Sandro Cavazza]
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay

[Verse 2: Sandro Cavazza]
Staring at the billboard from the bus
Looking at the faces, thinking that could be anyone of us
So give me hope, give me hope, give me hope on this lonely ride
Cause I know one day, I will be the one in the sky

[Pre-Chorus: Sandro Cavazza]
California, don't let me down
Seems so golden, but there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus, came to me
He once was a waiter, now he's a savior making money on the street

[Bridge: Sandro Cavazza]
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute
Sunset Jesus

[Outro: Sandro Cavazza]
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay
