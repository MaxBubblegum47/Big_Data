[Verse 1]
If the energy's right, just come my way
Baby, touch me so nice, won't be in vain, yeah
I can't even lie, I'm tryna see
Could you handle if I keep all of me?

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been saying a lot for a while now
So I hope you're not planning to slow down
But you act like there's nobody around
You've been saying a lot for a while now
So I hope you're not planning to slow down
We can act like there's nobody around
Boy, and all you gotta do, do is

[Chorus]
Touch me how I want you to
Baby, take your time
I'm gonna make this good for you
Boy, I'll blow your mind
I promise now that I'll be true
You're my perfect time
So touch me how I want you to
Touch me
Touch me

[Verse 2]
Just a matter of time 'til it's only us
And the moon is so right, wanna feel your touch
I can't even lie, I'm tryna see
Could you handle if I give all of me?

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been saying a lot for a while now
So I hope you're not planning to slow down
But you act like there's nobody around
You've been saying a lot for a while now
So I hope you're not planning to slow down
We can act like there's nobody around
Boy, and all you gotta do, do is

[Chorus]
Touch me how I want you to
Baby, take your time
I'm gonna make this good for you
Boy, I'll blow your mind
I promise now that I'll be true
You're my perfect time
So touch me how I want you to
Touch me
Touch me

[Bridge]
Just a matter of time 'til it's only us
Just a matter of time, just a matter of time
I can't even lie, I'm tryna see
Could you handle if I keep all of me?

[Chorus]
Touch me how I want you to
Baby, take your time
I'm gonna make this good for you
Boy, I'll blow your mind
I promise now that I'll be true
You're my perfect time
So touch me how I want you to, oh yeah
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me how I want you to
Baby, take your time
I'm gonna make this good for you
Boy, I'll blow your mind
I promise now that I'll be true
You're my perfect time
So touch me how I want you to
Touch me
