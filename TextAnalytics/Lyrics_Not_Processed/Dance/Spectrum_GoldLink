[Chorus]
Run through your clique
*Scratch*, you pissed, don't trip
I'ma have to bust you in your lips
And the whips, better have a whole lotta chips
'Cause I ain't for no *scratch* givin' tips
Run through your clique
*Scratch*, you pissed, don't trip
I'ma have to bust you in your lips
And the whips, better have a whole lotta chips
'Cause I ain't for no, I ain't for no
Run through your, run through your clique

Nakakainis talaga siya, pero iniisip ko na mahal na mahal ko siya. Parang palaging kami magkasama, pero may tiwala na ako sa kanya. Lahat ng ibang tao na dumating bago sa kanya, wala na sila. Di na bale

[Verse 1]
I learned a lot in such a short amount of time
Everything that's fuckin' fine and gold, it ain't mine
Met you when I was like maybe fifteen years old and you
Just act a lil' older plus I heard you came from Arizona
And I was new so I was poppin' up at house parties
Ridin' fuckin' dirty wit' the older niggas ridin' for me
And they just taught me how the game work
I said fuck it, I'ma push the rock and buy a lot of dumb shit
But fuck it, was my initial thought when I had met you
I was sittin' in the bleachers when your girls approached me
And they threw away your number like you wasn't taken or something
I told 'em, "Baby, I'm nothing, see why you wanna choose me?"
They giggled and walked away, I prayed to God
It felt so right, I never knew the devil fuckin' looked this nice
So if you ever tried to blame it on me
I'ma blame it on my dick, know I'm sick, yeah I'd run through ya

Run through your clique
*Scratch*, you pissed, don't trip
I'ma have to bust you in your lips
And the whips, better have a whole lotta chips
'Cause I ain't for no, I ain't for no
Run through your, run through your clique

[Verse 2]
Nineteen, I got a newer meaning
Rocked monk beads, God chains, searchin' for a deeper meaning
Still burnin' women, what a deadly contradiction
Nigga toyin' with the physical and spiritual
Lookin' back at what my life, man, what a fuckin' trip
I could've loved this bitch and lost myself so I can please the bitch
And never please a bitch is what I learned and then I went away from everything
I started searchin' for and well, uh
Mo' bitches, mo' money, mo' drugs
Found my niggas, started robbin', went west, start juggin'
Picked rappin', they chose, I blew, my crew
Got big, split wigs, still rob, mo' rap
We battle, we fight, we won, big one
No pun, all skill, no bitch in my clique
Young nigga, no whip, my niggas legit
And I pray for my clan and my squad while I run through your (clique)

[Bridge]
Run through your clique
Run through, run through your clique
Run through your clique
Run through

[Chorus]
Run through your clique
*Scratch*, you pissed, don't trip
I'ma have to bust you in your lips
And the whips, better have a whole lotta chips
'Cause I ain't for no *scratch* givin' tips
Run through your clique
*Scratch*, you pissed, don't trip
I'ma have to bust you in your lips
And the whips, better have a whole lotta chips
'Cause I ain't for no, I ain't for no
Run through your, run through your clique
