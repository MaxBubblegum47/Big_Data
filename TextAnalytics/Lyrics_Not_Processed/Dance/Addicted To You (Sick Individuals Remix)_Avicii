[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
I'm out of control
I'm addicted to you!
I'm addicted to you!
To you, to you, to you
I'm addicted to you!
To you, to you, to you

[Post-Chorus]
I'm addicted to you!
To you, to you, to you
