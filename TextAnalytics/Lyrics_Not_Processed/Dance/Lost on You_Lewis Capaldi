[Verse 1]
Lately, I'm getting lost on you
You got me doing things I never thought I'd do
Never spent so long on a losing battle
But lately, giving up don't seem to matter

[Chorus]
Every day, I'm a slave to the heartache
And you're wasting away every night
I don't wanna leave you lonely
But I've run out of love this time
You know that I adore you
Though I couldn't give enough
Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love

[Verse 2]
Lately, I'm getting lost on you
I tore your world apart like it was nothing new
Never bled so much when I didn't have to
I'm givin' up on a life lived after

[Chorus]
Every day, I'm a slave to the heartache
And you're wasting away every night
I don't wanna leave you lonely
But I've run out of love this time
You know that I adore you
Though I couldn't give enough
Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love

[Bridge]
I had a hold on your soul
But I lost my grip, let you go
I should've carried us both

[Chorus]
Every day, I'm a slave to the heartache
And you're wasting away every night
Don't wanna leave you lonely
But I've run out of love this time
You know that I adore you
Though I couldn't give enough
Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love, of your love
Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love
