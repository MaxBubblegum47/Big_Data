In reverse I change the tides
Waiting for the sun to rise
I ran a race across the line
Trapped the doubt and lost my mind
Fade to grey, colourblind
Watch the world fall behind
I was stuck on the other side
Now I'm lost in paradise

[2x]
Now I'm lost in para-
Take a chance, forget the old
Tried to fit to a different mold
Was it fate or did we collide
From parallel in another life
Fade to grey, colourblind
Watch the world fall behind
I was stuck on the other side
Now I'm lost in paradise

[2x]
Now I'm lost in para-
Fade to grey, colourblind
Watch the world fall behind
I was stuck on the other side
Now I'm lost in paradise
