[MELCHIOR]
Where I go, when I go there
No more memory anymore
Only men on distant ships
The women with them swimming with them to shore

[MORITZ]
Where I go, when I go there
No more whispering anymore
Only hymns upon your lips
A mystic wisdom, rising with them to shore

Touch me, just like that
And that, oh yeah
Now, that's heaven
Now, that I like
God, that's so nice
Now lower down
Where the figs lie

[COMPANY, throughout this interaction]
Oh, oh my god, oh, yeah yeah yeah
Touch me

[MORITZ, spoken]
Still...you must admit...with the two anatomies... it truly is daunting, I mean, how everything might...

[MELCHIOR, spoken]
Measure up?

[MORITZ, spoken]
Not that I'm saying I wouldn't... I wouldn't want to not...would ever not want to...

[MELCHIOR, spoken]
Moritz?

[MORITZ, spoken]
I have to go!

[MELCHIOR, spoken]
Moritz, wait!

[COMPANY]
Oh, oh, oh my God

[OTTO]
Where I go, when I go there
No more shadows anymore
Only men with golden fins
The rhythm in them, rocking with them to shore

[GEORG]
Where I go, when I go there
No more weeping anymore (No no, no)
Only in and out your lips
The broken wishes, washing with them to shore

[COMPANY]
Touch me
 
All silent
 
Baby, just tell me
 
"All is forgiven"
Touch
Oh...
 
There I go, there I go
 
Touch me
Just try it
Now, that's it
God, oh, that's heaven
Touch... I'll love you right
 
Where the sins cry
 

[MELCHIOR & MORITZ]
Touch me
 
All silent
 
Tell me, please
"
All is forgiven
"
Consume my wine
,
Consume my mind
I'll tell you how, how the winds sigh
 

[GEORG]
Oh, oh...
Just, just try it
Now, there, that's it
Oh God, that's heaven
Oh, I'll love you right
We'll wander down
Where the sins cry

[COMPANY]
Touch me, just like that
Now lower down, where the sins lie
Love me, just for a bit
We'll wander down, where the winds sigh
Where the winds sigh
Where the winds sigh
Where the winds sigh...
