[Intro]
I sit here alone
I sit here alone
I look at the walls
Look at the walls
Look at the walls
I look at the walls

[Verse 1]
You shouldn't be out on your own
Oh no not with a condition like that
Oh no sir constant care
A condition like that, a condition so rare
A penny for the guy, a penny for your thoughts
One a penny, two a penny in your pocket
Ding dong bell, who can tell
Wild Man Fisher got nothing on me

[Verse 2]
I sit by the water
I sit by the water
Watch it go by
Clouds going by
I'm watching the sky

[Verse 3]
I left my luggage at the station
Didn't know how to say goodbye
I walked away from all the fury
And the madness and the fury
And the madness and the fury
And the madness

[Bridge]
I smile to myself
I smile to myself

[Verse 4]
You're on the blind side, I'm on the other side
Now I'm on the outside looking for another side
Upside down side, I'm still lucid
I may be crazy but I'm not stupid
Try to get out, the parking lot's full
No matter, no matter, what's a man going to do
One two buckle my shoe
Zip my lip
