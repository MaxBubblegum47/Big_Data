Heartbreaks and, promises
I've had more than my
Share (more than my)
Tired of giving my
Love (oh)
And getting nowhere, nowhere
What I need is somebody who really cares
I really need a lover who wants to be there
Its been so long since I've touched a wanting hand
I can't put my love on the line
That I hope you'll understand
So baby, if you want me, you've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say
But you've got to show me love
You've got show me love
Give me a reason
What I need is somebody who will always be there
Don't you promise me the world, all that I've already heard
This time call me baby, actions speak louder than words
If you're looking for devotion, talk to me
So baby, if you want me, you've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say
But you've got to show me love
Give me a reason to love you
You've got to show me love x5
