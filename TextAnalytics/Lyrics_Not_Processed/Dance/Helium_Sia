[Verse 1]
I'm trying but I keep falling down
I cry out but nothing comes now
I'm giving my all and I know peace will come
I never wanted to need someone

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul

[Chorus]
Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need

[Verse 2]
And if you let go I'll float towards the sun
I'm stronger 'cause you fill me up
But when the fear comes and I drift towards the ground
I am lucky that you're around

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul

[Chorus]
Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium

[Bridge]
You lift me up and I am found
You lift me up before I hit the ground
You lift me up when I'm down, down, down
You lift me up before I hit the ground
You lift me up and I am found
You lift me up before I hit the ground
You lift me up when I'm down, down, down
You lift me up before I hit the ground!

[Chorus]
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like helium
