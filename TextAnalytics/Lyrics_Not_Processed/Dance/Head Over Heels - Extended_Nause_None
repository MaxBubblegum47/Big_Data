If you don't know
I am head over heels
So far gone in a dream with you
Dancing real slow
It's I never cared
And I was ready for defeat
But now there is?? to hold I watch them ground on stoney ground
If you don't know
I'm head over heels
So far gone in a dream with you dancing real slow
If you don't know
I'm head over heels
So far gone in a dream with you dancing real slow
So put your arms around me
And whisper in my ear
Wake me up so gently
The dream is still here
If you don't know
I'm head over heels
So far gone in a dream with you dancing real slow
If you don't know
I'm head over heels
So far gone in a dream with you dancing real slow
I was set to hide it
Thinking twice as shy
Told myself times over I believe a lie
I was cracking up
Let it shine through
The way you make me feel
I take my chance on you
I was set to hide it
Thinking twice as shy
Told myself times over I believe a lie
I was cracking up
Let it shine through
The way you make me feel
I take my chance on you
If you don't know
I'm head over heels
So far gone in a dream with you dancing real slow
So put your arms around me
And whisper in my ear
Wake me up so gently
The dream is still here
Yeah put your arms around me
And whisper in my ear
Wake me up so gently
The dream is still here
