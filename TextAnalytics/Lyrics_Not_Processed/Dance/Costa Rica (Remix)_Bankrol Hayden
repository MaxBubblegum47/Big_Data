[Intro: Bankrol Hayden]
Mmh, mmh, mmh
Give me a two, give me a go, uh
Yeah, I'm back, uh

[Chorus: Bankrol Hayden]
Ayy, like Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat 'fit Billionaire
Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat 'fit Billionaire

[Verse 1: Bankrol Hayden]
Now I'm living on my heaven shit
Louboutins, on my devil shit
Told her kick rock and she kickin' up pebbles, bitch
Slide with a truck 'cause I stay on my Travis shit
My bitch, she bad with big booty and freckles, bitch
We in the foreign, hit the gas when the pedal shift (Skrrt)
Baby my sign, man, for her, I go steppin' shit
There ain't no time, 'cause for you, this forever shit (Ooh, ooh)
Chopper go (Boom, brr, brr)
Fuckin' on me in the studio
Fallin' for me got you moody, though

[Chorus: Bankrol Hayden]
Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat 'fit Billionaire
Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat 'fit Billionaire

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI.]
Walk in like I'm in this bitch
Sixteen with a forty piece on my wrist, I
I'm in the back of the 'Bach with a thot
And she throwin' it back and I'm thinkin', damn, is this love?
This ain't love, we just fuck
'Cause I can't love no thot
Can't do this with you, I won't, I'm not
Gotta do this on my own, I got
Plans to make and bands to save
Lil' baby, I can't be fuckin' with you
Don't act surprised, I been this way
Lil' bitch, this here ain't nothin' new

[Chorus: Bankrol Hayden]
Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat 'fit Billionaire
Costa Rica, swipe a Visa
Seventeen, but I'm gon' be a millionaire
Drift the Bimmer, bloody sneakers
Pack a 'Wood and my sweat 'fit Billionaire
