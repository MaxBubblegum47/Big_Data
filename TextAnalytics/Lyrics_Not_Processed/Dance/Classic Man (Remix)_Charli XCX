[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar + 
Jidenna
]
I'm the only nigga doin' it, you other niggas ruined it
I'm too legit, go Hammer wit' the foolishness
My nana said my grammar can maneuver this industry
Until I'm stupid rich and now I'm stupid rich, ah
(
Even if she go away, even if she go away
) A-woo-woo!
Assumin' this is what they humor is
To Pimp a Butterfly
 my newest shit
In fact the rumor is the way I proven it

[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man

[Verse 2: Jidenna]
I burn through the hood like, "Whoa"
When everybody's feeling so cold
I cool like Nat King Cole
And niggas get a bit of my glow
I got charm like a leprechaun, mummafunka
Now y'all fucking with the wrong mummafunka
Chief be like a don, mummafunka
And we don't live by the law, mummafunka

[Pre-Hook: Jidenna]
Even if she go away, even if she go away
Even if she go away, even if she go away

[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
(Classic man) That's on my mama though
I got piranha flow, fuckin' up your designer clothes
(Casket man) Where be your rapper's angle?
Bunch of subliminal bitches, I'd rather fingerbang 'em
Oh, ke-mo sah-bee, pray to God nobody try me
Catch a body over nothin, Top couldn't even stop me
I got key to my city, I got key to California
I might legalize your homicide and more marijuana
Let my daddy smoke his weed, only thing they keep me friendly
I ain't got no jewelry on me, bitch, I got the jewelry in me
Oh, shit, let me talk my shit, I always been the shit
This ain't overnight, they love me now like they loved me then
I know what I like, I eat the pussy for my nourishment
I know how to cherish it
I know how to decorate your wall and further furnish it
I'ma burn your shit down, this is what the furnace is
I'ma turn your shit around wit' some friendly services
Ain't no nervousness like I'm ratchet or conservative
And that's affirmative
All I do is lay-up and face up my big bills and pay stub
Got no chill for fake ones, like, for real, they say I'm...

[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man

[Verse 4: Jidenna]
Keep my gloves dirty but my hands clean
Got to keep the business in the family
Breadwinner filling up the pantry
Now my niggas slang cane like a dandy
I tell you how it go
You pull out rubber bands, I pull out an envelope
The ladies on my elbow ain't for the show
Every madam on my team is a top Jeneral, oh
Got to be ready for war (War)
Should they get into my door? (Door)
Get 'em, we'll get 'em, I know that we'll get 'em
Cause I lived through this shit before, oh

[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man

[Outro]
(I'm a classic man) Even if she go away, even if she go away
(I'm a classic man) Even if she go away, even if she go away
I'm a classic man, old-fashioned man
