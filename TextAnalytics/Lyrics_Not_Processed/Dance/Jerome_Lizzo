[Intro]
Woo, oh
Here we go again
Uh-uh, hee-hee
Uh, look, listen, shut up

[Chorus]
Jerome, Jerome
Take your ass home
And come back when you're grown
Jerome, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns, ooh

[Verse 1]
Poor little baby
Who told you that you stood a chance with this royalty?
You're so sweet, bless your heart
Can't let a pretty face distract me from business
And God as my witness, your ugly ass won't either
I'm sorry, 2 AM photos with smileys and hearts
Ain't the way to my juicy parts
Boy, thank me later, looks good on paper
But love isn't easy, so I'll do the hardest part

[Chorus]
Jerome, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
And come back when you're grown
Jerome, ooh, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns

[Verse 2]
I never said I was perfect
Or you don't deserve a good person to carry your baggage
I know a few girls that can handle it
I ain't that kind of chick, but I can call 'em for you if you want
I never said that you wasn't attractive
Your style and that beard, ooh, don't get me distracted
I'm tryna be patient, and patience takes practice
The fact is I'm leaving, so just let me have this

[Chorus]
Jerome, Jerome
Take your ass home
And come back when you're grown, oh
Jerome, ooh, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns

[Outro]
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee
(Don't cry for me, baby)
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee
(Oh, don't cry for me, baby)
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee
