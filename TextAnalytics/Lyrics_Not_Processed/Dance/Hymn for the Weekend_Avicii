[Intro: Beyoncé]
And said drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Symphony
That we shoot across the sky
Pour on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
That we shoot across the sky

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin with Beyoncé]
You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
(Woo)
(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

[Verse 2: Chris Martin with Beyoncé]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin with Beyoncé]
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I, Oh-I, Oh-I
I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

[Bridge: Beyoncé with Chris Martin]
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

[Outro: Beyoncé  with Chris Martin]
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the... (Let me shoot)
Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the...
Let me shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...
