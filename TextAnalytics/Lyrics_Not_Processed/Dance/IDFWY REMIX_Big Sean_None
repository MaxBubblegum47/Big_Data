[Hook: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: 3am ]
I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil ass bitch,I ain't fuckin' with you
After all the shit i've been through
All you can do is bitchin'
While i'mma get these millions
Your new man just got on a rental
Towards you i'm unsentimental
All this time i treated you gentle
Now you ain't even worth my genitals
I'm schemin' like Ross
While you're screaming like thug
I'm on a whole new level
Got every bitch acting in the bed like devil
While your man driving Rental
I'm in the camaro gettin' skull by a bitch call her Melo


[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I coulda put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, goin' HAM in a rental
On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that

I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
