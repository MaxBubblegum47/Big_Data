[Intro]
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things (Very far)
The stranger things (Dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are

[Verse 1]
We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
How we gonna get out?
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember

[Pre-Chorus]
We left a life
That's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now

[Chorus]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I see your Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Show me the sky falling down

[Chorus]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in an ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh oh
Oh oh

[Bridge]
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things (Very far)
The stranger things (Dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are
A stranger things (very far)
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things (Very far)
For stranger things (Dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things (Very far)
For stranger things (Dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things (Very far)
For stranger things (Dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are

[Outro]
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things (Very far)
For stranger things (Dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are
