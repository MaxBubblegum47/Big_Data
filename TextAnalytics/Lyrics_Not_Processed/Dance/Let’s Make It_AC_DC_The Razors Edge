[Verse 1]
Hey, sugar baby
So hot and tasty
Come on, give me some love, you're driving me wild
It's way past midnight
Why don't we take a ride?
We'll make some honey as we're cruisin' real slow, yeah

[Chorus]
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it

[Verse 2]
I'll be your ladies man
If you give me the chance
We keep a-jumping till the music run dry
And if we take a rest
We'll smoke some cigarettes
And start a-smoking, going out of control
And

[Chorus]
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it

[Bridge]
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Let's not waste it
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
We're going to make it

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it

[Bridge]
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Let's not waste it
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
We're going to make it
Let's go

[Chorus]
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
