[Verse 1]
Burning everything I know
Desperate for a change
Crashing down the ancient roads
Past our yesterday

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe there is hunger in my blood
Screaming out loud for what I want
See me running full speed at it
Shattering, collide
Call it post-traumatic
Now it's do or die

[Chorus]
Coming after tiny fractures
Coming after tiny fractures
See me running full speed at it
Coming after tiny fractures
Call me post-traumatic
What comes after, tiny fractures

[Drop]
What comes after
Tiny fractures
What comes after
What comes after
Tiny fractures
What comes after
What comes after
Tiny fractures
What comes after

[Verse 2]
Feeding frenzy is in my brain
I'm hopeful every day
I gotta get it while we are still young enough to break
We're finally not afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe there is hunger in my blood
Screaming out loud for what I want
See me running full speed at it
Shattering, collide
Call me post-traumatic
Now it's do or die

[Chorus]
Coming after tiny fractures
Coming after tiny fractures
See me running full speed at it
Coming after tiny fractures
Call me post-traumatic
What comes after, tiny fractures

[Drop]
What comes after
Tiny fractures
What comes after
What comes after
Tiny fractures
What comes after
What comes after
Tiny fractures
What comes after
Tiny fractures
