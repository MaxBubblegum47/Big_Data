[Verse 1]
In a one horse town
They try to put you down
And make you feel out of place
Don't dare look in your face

[Chorus]
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Hey, hey
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 2]
On a hot summer day
Dollar bills come your way
Somebody robbed the bank
Ooh, they picked you outta the ranks
Hey

[Chorus]
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation

[Bridge]
(Oh, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
You better keep away
(Oh, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
Don't get in my face
Oh yeah
(Oh, oh yeah)
(Hey, yeah)

[Verse 3]
And I'm comin' down Main Street
Get out of my way
I ain't stoppin' for nobody

[Chorus]
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Wild, yeah

[Outro]
(Oh, yeah) Gotta keep away
(Hey, yeah) I ain't stoppin' for nobody
(Oh, yeah) I've got a wild reputation
(Hey, yeah)
