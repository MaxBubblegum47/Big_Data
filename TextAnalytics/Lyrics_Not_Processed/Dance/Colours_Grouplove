[Verse 1]
I am a man, man man man
Up, up in the air
And I run around, round round
Round this town town
And act like I don't care
So when you see me flying by the planet's moon
You don't need to explain if everything's changed
Just know I'm just like you

[Verse 2]
So I pull the switch, the switch, the switch inside my head
And I see black, black, green, and brown, brown, brown and blue
Yellow violets, red
And suddenly a light appears inside my brain
And I think of my ways, I think of my days
And know that I have changed

[Chorus]
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
You've still got your hands

[Verse 3]
So mistress, mistress have you been up to the roof?
He shot himself, self
There's blood on the wall
Cause he couldn't face the truth

Oh, knock that down, leave the ground and find some space
And tell your friends, friends
You'll be back again-gain
Before it's too late

[Chorus - modified]
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad

[Chorus]
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad

[Verse 4]
So I am a man, man, man, man
Up, up in the air
And I float around, round round
Round this town, town
And know I shouldn't care
So when you see us there, there out in the open road
You don't need to explain
If everything's changed
Just know that you don't know

[Outro]
We call it life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
We can't call it at all
We call it life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
When you can't call it at all
Yeah, we call it
Oh yeah that's what we call it
Ohhh
Yeah that's right, we call it
Ohhh
We do it for love, sweet love
