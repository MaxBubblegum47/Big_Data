She said she's waiting for when she will break
Don't let it be today
Don't let it be today
'Cause her and I have things we'd like to try
Some feelings she still hides
Until she finds the wine
She's absolutely shameless
Just like the sky whenever it's too bright
Sometimes it hurts my eyes
But I don't need my sight
If I feel her sass and I can taste her laugh
She's never really mad and she smiles when she is sad
She can't fool me
She can't fool me
But she can take me away
Or up any stairway
The further we can stray
The better are the days
I am a flower that's never seen the sun
I guess that I'm too young
But the soil, it weighs a ton
And I can't breathe
Uncover me
