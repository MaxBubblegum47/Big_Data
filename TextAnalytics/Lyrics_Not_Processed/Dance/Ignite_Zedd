[Verse 1]
There's a fire that burns inside
It's an instinct that never lies
The target's tattooed between our eyes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Stand and fight
Under the lights on the high stage
A part of your life it can take away
Just like the blood running through your veins

[Chorus]
Everyone's watching through your eyes
There's only two options
Win or die, win or die
Win or die, die, die, die, die
It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So reply, so reply

[Post-Chorus]
And ignite
Ignite
Ignite
Ignite

[Verse 2]
There's a power that's underneath
And you can't see it 'til you believe
On the edge of infinity

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Feel the rush
Under the lights on the high stage
A part of your life it can take away
Just like the blood running through your veins

[Chorus]
Everyone's watching through your eyes
There's only two options
Win or die, win or die
Win or die, die, die, die, die
It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So reply, so reply

[Post-Chorus]
And ignite
Ignite
Ignite
Ignite

[Outro]
It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So ignite, so ignite
