[Verse 1]
When you feel me up against your bones
Now don't you tell me to leave you alone
Now don't you tell me, now don't you tell me
I wear the crown coz I'm the one
To be anointed by you touch
Oh how you heal me, oh how you heal me

[Chorus]
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), touch me (do me like you're gonna do), touch me (touch me like you wanna do)
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), touch me (do me like you're gonna do), touch me (touch me like you wanna do)

[Verse 2]
Said you want it, baby (said you want it, baby)
What you gonna do
How you gonna please me
What you gonna do (what you gonna do)
I just want, I want you to
Said you want it, baby
I'm starving here for you, what you gonna feed me
What you wanna do, I want you, I want you

[Verse 1]
When you feel me up against your bones
Now don't you tell me to leave you alone
Now don't you tell me, now don't you tell me
I wear the crown coz I'm the one
To be anointed by you touch
Oh how you heal me, oh how you heal me

[Chorus]
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), touch me (do me like you're gonna do), touch me (touch me like you wanna do)
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), touch me (do me like you're gonna do), touch me (touch me like you wanna do)

[Outro]
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do)
I want you to touch me
I want you to touch me
I want you to touch me
I want you, I want you to touch me
Touch me
I want you to touch me
Touch me
