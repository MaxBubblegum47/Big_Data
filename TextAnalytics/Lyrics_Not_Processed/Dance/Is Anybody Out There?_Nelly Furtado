[Intro: Nelly Furtado]
I don't wanna be left
In this war tonight
Am I alone in this fight?
Is anybody out there, yeah
Don't wanna be left, left in this world behind
Say you'll run to my side

[Verse 1: K'naan]
Something 'bout Mary
Never won a pageant
Never felt pretty
Never looked like Cameron
Diaz was her last name
Always been abandoned
Keep your head up
Baby girl this is your anthem
There goes Hannah
Showin' off her banner
Rocking that crown
Make them boys go bananas
When you're insecure about yourself
It's a fact
You can point a finger
But there's three pointing back

[Pre-Hook: K'naan]
I can see her crying out, yeah
Is there anybody out there?
She's really counting on your love
Still struggling uphill
But you act like you don't care
Right now she could really use a shoulder
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
She's crying for your love tonight
Loneliest is hard to survive, she said

[Hook]

[Verse 2: K'naan]
His name was Adam
When his mom had him
Dad was a phantom
Never took a look at him
Grew up mad and
Antisocial
Hated outdoors
Always in playing madden
Adam was lonely
Drugs were the only
Way out of his own life
Now he's slowly
Losing his fire
Close to retire
With one last hope
He puts his arms up higher

[Pre-Hook: K'naan]
I can see him crying out, yeah
Is there anybody out there?
He's really counting on your love
Still struggling uphill
But you act like you don't care
Right now he could really use a shoulder
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
He's crying for your love tonight
Loneliest heart to survive, he said

[Hook:]

[Bridge: Nelly Furtado]
If you feel the way I feel
Like you've been talking to yourself
Well this one's for everyone who's felt invisible
Lonely in a crowded room
Searching for someone like you
Can't do it all alone (no one can baby)
Can't do it all alone (no one should baby)
Is anybody out there?
(somebody, anybody)
Is anybody out there?
I'm right here for your
Is anybody out there?

[Hook:]
