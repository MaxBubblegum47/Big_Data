[Intro]
Down (x7)

[Verse 1: tobyMac]
I've always been a dreamer, a soul seeker
I knew my life was meant for something deeper
You've shown me there's beauty all along the way

[Verse 2: Ryan Stevenson]
I've been walking till my feet hurt, holes in my t-shirt
Caught me at the Goodwill cuz you know it's cheaper
Only got a few dollars to my name

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Stevenson]
No I, I, I, I'm never gonna stop believing
Yea I, I, I, Imma let 'em know till the day I die

[Chorus: tobyMac]
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
We'll lift you up
Till this place erupts
We'll lift You up
Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down

[Verse 3: tobyMac]
Yea it's been a long road, but I'mma still flow
I keep pouring out my heart for the people
I'll never let the passion fade away

[Verse 4: Ryan Stevenson]
And You're the only reason, I'm preaching freedom
We'll be turning every eye to the kingdom
There ain't no way that'll ever change
No, no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Stevenson]
No I, I, I, I'm never gonna stop believing
Yea I, I, I, Imma let 'em know till the day I die

[Chorus: tobyMac]
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
We'll lift you up
Till this place erupts
We'll lift You up
Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down

[Bridge]
(tobyMac)
How many times they need to hear me say it?
I'm a freak for You, I'm here to make You famous
Just here to tear it apart, here to light the dark
I'm debt free like a bird cuz You paid the cost
So every time I get a mic in the palm of my hand
I'mma tear the place down like it's my last stand
But for You is my hill worth dying on, man
The only place that I've ever belonged
Oh I'm never gonna stop believing
Oh, I'mma let 'em know, yea I'mma let 'em know

[Chorus]

[Chorus: tobyMac]
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
We'll lift You up
Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
We'll lift you up
Till this place erupts
We'll lift You up
Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
Cuz You ain't ever gonna let us down
