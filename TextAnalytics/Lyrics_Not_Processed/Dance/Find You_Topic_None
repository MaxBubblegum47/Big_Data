[Verse 1]
When I'm looking for colors
When I'm stuck in a world of grey
There's a part of me pointing to you like a compass
Every inch of your body is
Like it's pencilled into my brain
And I carry you around like you fit in my pocket

[Pre-Chorus]
And nothing, and nothing they do
Could get me away from you
Yeah, nothing and nothing they do
Could get me away from you
'Cause I see you shining through

[Chorus]
No, I don't get lost
And it's all because
I know that I'll find you
Yeah, when the skies get dark
You're my Northern Star
And I know that I'll find you
Find you, find you
And I know that I'll find you
I know that I'll find you

[Verse 2]
There's a place I can go to
All I need is to close my eyes
And I'm back at a time when we never got older
I can feel your lips on me
Like we're still living in paradise
And you whisper in my ear like your hand's on my shoulder

[Pre-Chorus]
And nothing, and nothing they do
Could get me away from you
Yeah, nothing and nothing they do
Could get me away from you
'Cause I see you shining through

[Chorus]
No, I don't get lost
And it's all because
I know that I'll find you
Yeah, when the skies get dark
You're my Northern Star
And I know that I'll find you
Find you, find you
And I know that I'll find you
I know that I'll find you
