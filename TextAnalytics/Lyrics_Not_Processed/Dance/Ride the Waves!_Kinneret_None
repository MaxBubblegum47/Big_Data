[Verse 1]
I can feel the current of the moon
There's only one
Ride the waves made by the moon
They're so much fun
Ocean tides change with the time
Do you know why?
Because of the moon
The shiny object in the sky

[Chorus]
Ride the waves, and ride them fast
Go pass life right by
But you can't ride past
The shiny object in the sky
You can ride them far, and ride them wide
Or you can swiftly glide
But you can't ride past
The shiny object in the sky

[Verse 2]
I cannot compete with all the evil in the streets
So I go to the sea where there's no one that can be mean to me
And it feels like I'm free
From everything that follows me, that watches me
Except the moon; it leaves me be
No industries in the deep blue sea
No corruption from large companies
I don't want any company
Don't need to be accompanied
This ocean sounds like a symphony

[Bridge]
The conductor stands up high
Conducts the ocean tides
They're changing with the time
While it's hanging in the sky
The conductor stands up high
Conducts the ocean tides
They're changing with the time
While it's hanging in the sky
While it's hanging in the sky
I wish I was in the sky
But outer space is far from me
The ocean sits right next to me
The moon is looking after me

[Chorus]
So I'll ride the waves, and ride them fast
Go pass life right by
But I won't ride past
The shiny object in the sky
I can ride them far, and ride them wide
Or I can swiftly glide
But I won't ride past
The shiny object in the sky
(the moon is looking after me)
