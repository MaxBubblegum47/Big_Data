[Verse 1]
I was a child walking with giants a hundred feet tall
Out in the wild, you wouldn't believe all the things that I saw
I took a high road out in the open under those stars
And all the while, I just got closer to going too far

[Chorus]
So now I'm running like you set me free out in the wild
I know you want me to come home but it might take a while
I got my heart in my hands while my head's up in the clouds
And only heaven knows if I will make it back to you
So I, I just keep running

[Post-Chorus]
And I said, oh
And only heaven knows if I will make it back

[Verse 2]
Where the sand runs into the ocean's where I'll get lost
And let the raindrops fall all around my castle of cards
Faced with the lions, I felt the courage leading my heart
Cause even I know every battle leaves you with scars

[Chorus]
So now I'm running like you set me free out in the wild
I know you want me to come home but it might take a while
I got my heart in my hands while my head's up in the clouds
And only heaven knows if I will make it back to you

[Post-Chorus]
And I said, oh
And only heaven knows if I will make it back to you

[Bridge]
I just keep running
Oh, I'll never stop running
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows
So I, I just keep running

[Outro]
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows
I just keep running
And only heaven knows if I will make it back
I was a child walking with giants a hundred feet tall
