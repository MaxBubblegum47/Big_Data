[Verse]
Dirt on your shoulders
I swear I remember when it changed
Don't you remember
I swear I can see it

[Pre Chorus]
You're there with your wide-eyed smile again
You'll be alright now
If you just let it go
Let it go

[Chorus]
I feel the weight around you breaking your bones
Let me make it better (Whoa)
Just settle down and let me carry you home
And let me ease the pressure (Oh)

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Pull all the blinds down
Just close both your eyes now
Yeah I'll stay
Turn all the lights out, I'll stay awake
And fight off the demons
'Cause you got a heart they'll never take
Yeah, it's alright now
You gotta let it go
Let it go

[Instrumental]
