[Kanye West]
Why are you so Paranoid?
Don't be so Paranoid

[Big Sean; Verse 1]
Aye, Aye
Now baby I can tell you want more cause you put less out
And every time you stepped in I could tell you stepped out
Your girlfriend said I remind her of the rest, yea
But tell yo girlfriend that she remind me of the Press
Just talkin' and talkin'
So maybe we can sneak to the back then
I know you heard about the freaks that was back then
So last week, we so right now
They so hyped up man tell 'em pipe down
And you can tell from the watch and chain
They been in and out my jeans like pocket change
Just be real, man I wouldn't be real
If I ain't have my fair share like the stock exchange
And if today tend from your past relations
Walk around witcho girl sayin that you hate men (What?)
Aye yo you either let go or you go lesbo turn around and date them
So maybe we should head to the exit
Just is from your friends not to mess with (Who me?)
Cause they caught a case with they ex-es
They mad you'd a leave while a nigga ex-stressed
But we know what it is right?
So we gone let 'em live right?
You know why they call me Big right?
Tell 'em look left while we get right
(right, right, right)

[Kid CuDi: Hook]
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you anyway
They don't know you like I do
They'll never know you

[Kanye West: Verse 2]
All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights that are long
So now you here with me stressing about it too
Leave that attitude way back at home
Yea you see 'em look dirty
Let 'em give you cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk and the world lost in the world
Can you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel but sorry we're closed
Baby, Don't worry about it
Baby, we'll go out to the floor

[Hook]

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Baby don't worry about it
Lady don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing

[Hook]
