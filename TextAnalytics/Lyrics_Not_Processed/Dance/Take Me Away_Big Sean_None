Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way
(Pick your planet, break it, roll it, blow it, then get blown away.) x2

5,4,3,2,1 blunts passed off
Pick your planet, roll it, toke it, smoke it, then we blast off
I'll probably be on mars when I light up
Clean up, then head down to Venus to get wifed up
The nigga in me wanna go to Pluto to get (iced up)
Race through space
Damn these colors vibrant
I'm going on a trip without the luggage
But there's baggage cause I bagged it
If the police see I have it
Flash the badge and they'll try to

Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way
(Pick your planet, break it, roll it, blow it, then get blown away.) x2

Green, yellow,orange, brown, red and that purp purp
Got me on my Final Frontier like Captain Kirk Kirk
Not to be on my ball sack
But, this isn't Star Trek
So puff the magic dragon and hop on my flying carpet
Preacher told me I should listen to more Mary Mary
But, I love Mary so much Imma probably marry Mary
Mary J. naw

Mary Jane like Peter Parker spot a maid
And I hope she feel the same

Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way
(Pick your planet, break it, roll it, blow it, then get blown away.) x2

Zoomin' the reason that I'm cruisin'
It's cause I'm steady waitin' to exhale
Blowin' on that Whitney Houston
She get me so emotional, delirious
If I hit more than a few times I'm tearin' up
And when life tear me up, god damnit it tear me up
She can be my mascot, always there to cheer me up
Oh my God I'm goin' I'm goin' I'm gone
Call me on my phone nah my nigga I'm zoned out

Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way
(Pick your planet, break it, roll it, blow it, then get blown away.) x2

Pick it, pick it, roll it (x4)
Then we blast off
Pick it, pick it, roll it (x4)
Then we blast off
