Miguel, Sean Don

Mami you looking like I'm just another guy
That came to check you
That came to wreck you
No disrespect but mami that's correct cause...
What's in them jeans just got my mind hectic
I can see that you're feeling my fashion
Is it cause I'm flashing
Or is it this cash that's just way too reckless?
Or is it this necklace?
Wait let me interrupt myself with this smash you see

[Hook:]
I don't wanna be loved
I don't wanna be loved
I just wanna quickie
No bite marks, no scratches, and no hickies
If you can get with that, mami come get with me
I don't wanna be loved
I don't wanna be loved
I just wanna quick fix
Up in your mix miss
Send me you wishlist
I have you addicted
So mami come get this

[Big Sean]
I just, I just, I just wanna kiss you on your lips
Between your hips, look down, I'm packing, fuck a trip
I want you to say my name girl
What's my name? Like I forget
I love it how you move it because
You do it to my dick
You got that back seat Caddy pussy
You should let me ride
No time to take her panties off
So move 'em to the side
I'm back go big chaining, I'm big slanging
I'm smoking good: Rick James
And I'm training ladies, I'm bitch taming
I'm rubbered up cause your bitch raining
I'm all in your butt like beyo-, beyo-, beyo-, bitch
Let's make it quicker than tea-time
I got her legs doing a peace sign
I'm in between her like halftime
It's "hit ass time"
And I gotta go cause I'm running late
Even for CP time
Hit once and it was new sheets time

[Hook]

Mami I realize that I'm mannish
Speak a language of love like Spanish
"Quero Fugir"
I'm so obscene and know what I mean?
Yeah sorry that was Portuguese
And I speak with ease
Please (aha) get on them knees
I gotta penny for your thoughts
If you know what I mean

[Hook]

Don't be offended babe
By what I say
It's just a game
And how I play
Pillage and plunder
Call me ya plumber
Knock on this wood
Get rocked by this thunder [x2]
