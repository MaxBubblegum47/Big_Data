It would be no surprise that Avicii’s retirement announcement would spark interesting developments across the electronic music sphere, and now we get our first concrete evidence of that.

Viagogo, calling itself the “world’s largest source of live event tickets,” has reported a 151% surge in demand for Avicii tickets. Demand for Creamfields alone surged 87% overnight.

Avicii’s final performances are in locations such as “Ibiza, Japan, Poland, Israel, Sweden and Dubai, as well as a stints at Lisbon’s Rock in Rio, Electric Daisy Carnival UK, Ultra Korea, Weekend Festival Baltic and Creamfields.”

A viagogo spokesperson commented: “Avicii has become a world-renowned DJ, carving himself as a major player in the industry, not just in the UK but across the globe. As a result he has a huge and loyal fanbase who are desperate to see him in what could be his ever last tour.”

It’s not uncommon for retirement announcements to send ticket prices and demand soaring; take the announcement of Kobe Bryant’s retirement into account, when tickets prices for his final game more than tripled after the announcement.

Undoubtedly, fans will be seeing this opportunity as their final chance to see a legend and to say goodbye. Though he will continue music, chances that he returns behind the decks are slim. However, we’ve seen similar claims from Wolfgang Gartner, Feed Me, and Pendulum, and look what happened there.

Truth is, only time will tell. In the meantime, fans will continue to clamor over tickets.
