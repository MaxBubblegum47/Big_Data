[Verse 1]
Some days I wonder why the sky's so grey
Some days I wonder if I'm on the same page

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, all the voices and noises
And all these bad choices
It's crazy, I haven't gone insane
And all the people, so careless
Who I can't confront yet
'Cause you know I'll just get in the way

[Chorus]
So at 3 am I go to the roof
And I talk back to the moon
Oh, at 3 am I look up to the sky
And always wonder why
I'm not like anyone else, else
Not like anyone else, else
But I'll never change myself

[Verse 2]
Most days I wonder why they're all so fake
Most days I try to understand it's just a phase

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, all the voices and noises
And all these bad choices
It's crazy, I haven't gone insane
And all the people, so careless
Who I can't confront yet
'Cause you know I'll just get in the way

[Chorus]
So at 3 am I go to the roof
And I talk back to the moon
Oh, at 3 am I look up to the sky
And always wonder why
I'm not like anyone else, else
Not like anyone else, else
But I'll never change myself

[Outro]
3 am, once again
Talking back with my fav'rite friend
It is tough and hard to tell
But one day they'll wish they were themselves
