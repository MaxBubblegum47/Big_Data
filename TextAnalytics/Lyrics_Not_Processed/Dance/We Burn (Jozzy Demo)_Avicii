[Verse 1]
All my life I've been learning
I've always lived for today
And I don't know about tomorrow
But I can choose to make it great

[Bridge]
Get used to me
Not being what you want
I guarantee
There's more than what you thought
There's one of me
Get used to me
I can't waste all my many days, no

[Chorus]
Cause we, we burn faster than light
Shine across in the night sky
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light, light light

[Post-Chorus]
Light, Light, Light
Light, Light, Light
Light, Light, Light
Light, Light, Light
Light, Light, Light
We, we burn faster than light

[Instrumental Outro]
