[Verse 1: Oliver Sykes]
Another day, another post-traumatic order
Brainwashed and feeling fine
I bit off more than I could chew when I looked closer
So I stabbed a fork in my eye

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
Think I'm losing my fucking mind
Don't know where to turn, now I'm blind
Destroy yourself, it feels so good to fade away
Why do you wanna hurt yourself?
Die for something else?
Don't let your conscience get in the way

[Chorus: Oliver Sykes]
Obey, we hope you have a lovely day
Obey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, now
There's nothing to see here, it's under control
We're only gambling with your soul
Obey, whatever you do
Just don't wake up and smell the corruption

[Post-Chorus: Oliver Sykes & 
YUNGBLUD
]
Do you feel that
?
 Yeah

[Verse 2: YUNGBLUD]
Another day, another systematic nightmare
Commemorate a wonderful life
Bite me first, I'll bite you back, melodramatic laughter
I stabbed a knife in my eye

[Pre-Chorus: YUNGBLUD]
Think I'm out my fucking mind
Brainwashed and I'm feeling fine
Destroy yourself, it feels too good to fade away
Why do I wanna hurt myself?
Should I die for something else?
I let my conscience get in the way

[Chorus: Oliver Sykes & YUNGBLUD]
Obey, we hope you have a lovely day
Obey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, now
There's nothing to see here, it's under control
We're only gambling with your soul
Obey, whatever you do
Just don't wake up and smell the corruption

[Breakdown: Oliver Sykes]
When your freedom is lethal
Tell me how you're gonna hurt yourself
You call yourselves peaceful
You monsters are people
You fucking monsters are people

[Bridge: Oliver Sykes & 
YUNGBLUD
]
Obey, 
we're gonna show you how to behave
Obey, 
it's nicer when you can't see the chains

[Chorus: Oliver Sykes & YUNGBLUD]
Obey, we hope you have a lovely day
Obey, you don't want us to come out and play away now, now
There's nothing to see here, it's under control (It's under control)
We're only gambling with your soul (With your soul)
Obey, whatever you do
Just don't wake up and smell the corruption

[Outro: Oliver Sykes & YUNGBLUD]
Smell the corruption
Smell the corruption
