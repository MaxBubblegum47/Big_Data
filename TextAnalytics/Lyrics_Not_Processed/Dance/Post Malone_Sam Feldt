[Verse 1]
One more drink, got one more Bacardi
One more dance at this afterparty
We still going, going strong
Speed so fast like a Ferrari
We get wild like on safari
We still going, going strong

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of these good things, good things, good things
All we need, good things, good things, good things

[Chorus]
Tonight, we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home tonight
Ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home

[Post-Chorus]
We are never, ever going home
We are never, ever going home

[Verse 2]
See the ocean there in your eyes
In slow motion, we see the sun rise
We are, we are in a zone
5 AM and we still are rolling
In the deepest of my emotions
We are, we are in a zone

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of these good things, good things, good things
All we need, good things, good things, good things

[Chorus]
Tonight, we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home tonight
Ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
Yeah, we are never, ever going home

[Chorus]
Tonight, we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home tonight
Ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home

[Post-Chorus]
Home
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
Never, ever going home
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
