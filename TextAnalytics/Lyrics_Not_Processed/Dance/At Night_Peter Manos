[Verse 1]
Every time you look at me, I shake it off
And you know that I hate it when you brush it off (Brush it off)
And I know that you like it when I'm in love
And you know that I tell you when I can
But every time you look at me, I shake it off

[Chorus]
Ooh, I don't really miss you when I think about it
Ooh, I don't really miss you when I think about it, think about it
Ooh, I don't really miss you when I think about it but
I miss you at night
I miss you at night

[Verse 2]
Laying on your sidewalk, how could I? (How could I?)
How did you forget all the trouble that we spent (Spent)
I don't really wanna die, I just wanna vent
Talk, talk it through lens and
Maybe we could flesh out
Everything is jaded
Kinda spent and complicated
I still wanna talk about it but your memory's deflating
But I don't really wanna lie
I don't really wanna die

[Chorus]
Ooh, I don't really miss you when I think about it
Ooh, I don't really miss you when I think about it, think about it
Ooh, I don't really miss you when I think about it but
I miss you at night
I miss you at night

[Outro]
I don't really tell you everything that I can't relay
I don't really wanna tell you everything that I can't replace
Tell me all the little things that I can't seem to face
I don't really tell you everything that I can't relay
I don't really wanna tell you everything that I can't replace
Tell me all the little things that I can't seem to face
I don't really tell you everything that I can't relay
I don't really wanna tell you everything that I can't replace
Tell me all the little things that I can't seem to face
