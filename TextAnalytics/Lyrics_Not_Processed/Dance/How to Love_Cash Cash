[Intro]
One two three

[Verse 1]
I've been running from the pain
Trying not to feel the same
But it's a shame that we're sinking
See, my confidence is shaking
And my heart is feeling vacant
So you try to fill it in

[Pre-Chorus]
You say "I could fix the broken in your heart
You're worth saving, darling"
But I don't know why you're shooting in the dark
I got faith in nothing

[Chorus]
But love, pray for me
I never had somebody
So I don't know how to love
Pray for me
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love

[Verse 2]
I know it's been a while
Cause my memory's on trial
For the way I used to be
My head is running miles
Round in circles and I try
To find the little light in me

[Pre-Chorus]
You say "I could fix the broken in your heart
You're worth saving, darling"
But I don't know why you're shooting in the dark
I got faith in nothing

[Chorus]
But love, pray for me
I never had somebody
So I don't know how to love
Pray for me
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love

[Outro]
I know I need somebody
I know I need somebody
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love
How to love
How to love
So I can learn how to love
How to love
How to love
How to love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, oh
I know I need somebody
I know I need somebody
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love
(Need somebody now
How to love, love
How to love, love)
