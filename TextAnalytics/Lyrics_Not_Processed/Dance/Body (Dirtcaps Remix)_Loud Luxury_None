[Verse 1]
Babe, don't make a sound
2 a.m. love gotta keep it down (keep it down)
Don't wait around for a signal now
Gimme some verbs I ain't talkin' nouns (I'm naughty)
You wanna ride in the 6
You wanna dine in the six (dine in the six)
But when I lean for the kiss
You said I'll probably send you some pics
And I'm like

[Pre-Chorus]
Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
Hell nah, I want that crew love (don't leave, baby)
Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
Hell nah, I want that crew love

[Chorus]
Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah
Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah

Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah
Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
On my, on my, on my, on my 'cence, yeah
On my, on my, on my, on my 'cence, yeah
On my, on my, on my, on my 'cence, yeah
On my, on my, on my, on my 'cence, yeah

[Verse 2]
Babe, just hit the pedal
If things goin' wrong it's just incidental
My bad, never got the memo
But you never have fun while you're in the limo, yeah
If you wanna ride in the 6
You wanna dine in the six (dine in the six)
You wanna lean for the kiss
You said I'll probably send you some pics
And I'm like

[Pre-Chorus]
Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
Hell nah, I want that crew love (don't leave, baby)
Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
Hell nah, I want that crew love

[Chorus]
Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah
Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah

Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah
Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
On my, on my, on my, on my 'cence, yeah
On my, on my, on my, on my 'cence, yeah
On my, on my, on my, on my 'cence, yeah
On my, on my, on my, on my 'cence, yeah

[Outro]
On my, on my, on my, on my 'cence, yeah
On my, on my, on my, on my
On my, on my, on my, on my 'cence, yeah
On my, on my, on my, on my
