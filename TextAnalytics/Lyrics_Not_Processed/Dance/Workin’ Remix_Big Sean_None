Intro:
Coughin green yeah im burning
Wanna smoke wit me you gon learn somethn
Don't wanna breathe when im working
I will try to leave when my work done

Verse 1: [AlcoPollock]
Don't talk to me when im working
Tryna get the dollars boy im preserving
Feels like poverty but ive been earning
I really have a lot but i'm still thirsty
Isn't quite enough and it's disturbing
Greed is like a urge that just keeps recurring
Even my girl refers to the worst thing
Shes concerned that we arent sturdy
I'm like babe I promise no worries
But show no mercy to prove that im worthy
I got a big journey I know that it's worth it
I shoulda started early cuz nobody heard of me
I gotta be quick man I gotta hurry
I gotta get my shit together it's urgent
Gotta think hard and give em what's current
Gotta find the market so I can be a merchant

Chorus: [Travis Scott]
Don't bother me when I'm working
Please don't bother her when she jerkin'
It goes down behind these curtains
Got to watch out cause these niggas lurkin'
Got to watch the block when making these purchase
Got to take your girl to find a new surgeon
Cause whoever designed that ass it ain't working
Order up a shot of vodka still going up
Need some blue dot in my cup
Cause this shit ain't working
No, this shit ain't working

Verse 2: [AlcoPollock]
Gotta hit the target that'll make you wanna purchase
I could be a god have a church built by servants
Controversial attitude brings universal worship
Y'all are just earthlings but I was deserted
Makin' all the shots like im fuckin' steph curry
I work to be an expert because I'm so determined
Did research and your shit is gettin worse son
Imma get it first because I deserved it
I got a lot of nerve but I say what I observe and
I may sound like a jerk but I think that we should purge it
Or at least convert to the old school merch it's
Like a rebirth it's like entrepreneurship
Insert new words so diverse and immersive
You never heard them used when you are converseing
Listen up now because you might learn something
Witness my style, im proud when the verse done

Chorus: [Travis Scott]
Don't bother me when I'm working
Please don't bother her when she jerkin'
It goes down behind these curtains
Got to watch out cause these niggas lurkin'
Got to watch the block when making these purchase
Got to take your girl to find a new surgeon
Cause whoever designed that ass it ain't working
Order up a shot of vodka still going up
Need some blue dot in my cup
Cause this shit ain't working
No, this shit ain't working
