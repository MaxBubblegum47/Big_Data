[Verse 1: LP]
Step off the train at dawn
Back in the place where I was born
It's been ten years since I've been gone
It took me ten years to know I'm wrong

[Pre-Chorus: LP]
I've been everywhere, nothing is new
And I've done everything I've set out to do
I'm nothing without you
Without you I'm nothing at all

[Chorus: LP]
Now I'm back where I belong
No matter where I'm from
It's been here all along
I finally made it home

[Breakdown]

[Verse 2: LP]
Don't know the price of time
Until you know what life can buy
You know I hope the world's been kind
Hope you can see it in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus: LP]
And I've been everywhere, and nothing is new
And I've done everything I've set out to do
I'm nothing without you
Without you I'm nothing at all

[Chorus: LP]
Now I'm back where I belong
No matter where I'm from
It's been here all along
I finally made it home
I finally made it home

[Breakdown]

[Chorus: LP]
Now I'm back where I belong
No matter where I'm from
It's been here all along
I finally made it home
