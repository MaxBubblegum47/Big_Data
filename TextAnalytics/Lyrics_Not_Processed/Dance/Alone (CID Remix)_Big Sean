[Intro]
If I

[Verse 1: Halsey]
Said he tried to phone me, but I never have time
He said that I never listen, but I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali, but I'm gone every night
So I fill it with strangers so they keep on the lights
She said she told you she knows me, but the face isn't right
She asked if I recognized her and I told her I might

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind, yeah

[Chorus: Halsey]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Unh, look
I'm a real rare individual
I'm in the physical and the metaphysical (yeah)
I know you need your alone time, that's critical
But I need some of your time, is that hypocritical?
Damn, you know I relate to you more than fam
So I won't sit around and let you sink in quicksand
Look, I know you got million dollar plans
And you tryna build a brand, live a life in high demand
Swerving big b's, your bag got little G's
Gucci down to the socks like Biggie and Little Ceas'
Let's hit the Maldives and hide behind palm trees
Little red wine, weed, and a calm breeze
'Cause baby, you been living life inside a bubble
When the last time you had somebody hug you?
Hold up, when the last time you had somebody love you?
Hold up, when the last time you love someone who love you?

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey, 
Big Sean
]
You know that everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it 
(for real)
But I'm still alone in my mind

[Chorus: Halsey]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)

[Verse 3: Stefflon Don]
Stay up ina me all night ana rock

Yuh all ways tell me seh mi full ah attitude
An yuh nuh like mi friend cah she rude

Window down cah u haffi see me with ma king

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna hit it
But I'm still alone in my mind

[Chorus: Halsey]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)
Yeah, yeah

[Outro: Halsey]
(I know you wanna, I, I know you wanna)
You'll wish that you never did, oh
(I, I know you wanna slip under my armor)
(I know you wanna, I, I know you wanna)
You'll wish that you never did
