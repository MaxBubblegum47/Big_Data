[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Kevin Gates, I'm everybody sworn favorite
People tend to feel I'm Micheal Jackson reincarnated
Satellites, never really made love
Alright

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love, but she gon' get it right
Emotions probably telling her she could stay the night
But her friends all call us crazy, they don't give her good advice
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love, Gates
Never really made love
Say she never really made love

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I've been shot through the heart
Just on the d-low, Lucas Brasi selling kilos
Gotta shop outta town and got a spot just around the way
Let's be specific, if I'm the nigga you feeling
Am I wrong for showing interest in these women surrounding
I'ma straight dick her down and go
No time to lounge with hoes
On the grind, all the time
I done been down this road
Strictly need my c-notes, can you keep up with my lingo
Some'll say life is a gamble, which means love is a casino
Everybody just playin' to win, think I made again
Though many ladies pretend, hoping this ain't what it is
This business I'm in, may make me taking a bid
Would you still be my friend, when I'm lonely love
Get 'em gone, cause ain't no one on the phone, but us
Someone who strong when it's rough, someone who won't give up
Ain't no wasting time, hustle every night
Promise everything is alright

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love but she gone get it right
Emotions probably telling her, she could stay the night
But her friends all call us crazy, they don't give her good advice
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love, Gates
Never really made love, oh
Say she never really made love, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
People changing on me, I am so sick of the masquerades
Grew up poor, had no dishes, ate off paper plates
I'm taking aim, brought up in this life I know
Baby you a rider and I love when you ride it slow
Motion for me girl
Arch up to the ceiling, now bend over for me girl
Pulling on your hair, while I'm gripping on your ass
When I kill it from the back, know you feel it in your back
Late night screaming, all of the right reasons
Touching, teasing, blowing it might please
Make it bite back, I love when it bite me
Saying take some out, I know what it might be
When your body go to shaking, you're raising your right knee
Bit the pillow with your teeth, I know what it might mean
I'ma keep going, I know that the light green
Can't stay still, I'm stroking the right thing
Climb in the bed, with a dime in the bed
Don't tell me the spot, I'mma find it instead
Big fine muthafucka, she a dime with the head
Just got a text, never mind what it said
IPhone ringing, I decline with a fret
Which color should I press, lime or the red
Decline or accept, next line never read
Minus the time and the time been the best
Told her what it was first time that we met
But she cry and get upset every time that I left

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love but she gone get it right
Emotions probably telling her, she could stay the night
But her friends all call us crazy, they don't give her good advice
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love, Gates
Never really made love, oh
Say she never really made love, oh-oh
