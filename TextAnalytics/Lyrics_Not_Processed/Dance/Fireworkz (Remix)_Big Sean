[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Say bitch I do it
A million dollar stacking loud packing
Man my weed and pockets matching
What is you asking, shut the fuck up
I’m talking in the real nigga accent man
And all these hoes attracted to the fucking main attraction
At my shows, my shows, watch me do
100 bottles, none for you
I’m rolling weed up, I’m getting high
And since I came up, she want me to come inside
I'm the fuckin' guy man I'm just I’m just too much, yeah too much
I twist my fingers, my crew up
I’m from where niggas get chewed up
Fucked around and I blew up
Me and my niggas hit the charts
Fucked around and I flew up
Yeah a nigga got 2 nuts, and I still don’t give a 2 fucks
Bitch I do it

[Hook]
She had, better be a keeper, I don’t think I ever seen a girl so fly
Since I said nice to meet ya, I don’t wanna leave her
Oh I think I really wanna make you mine
Uh baby you're a diva, I don’t wanna see her
End up with any other guys
Come over to the table, I got what you came for
Pick up a glass girl and let’s get right
Cause you got a hell of a body
Let me take you to Jail Little Mommy
Cause you got what I need and I got what you came for
I can give you what these other niggas ain’t able
Oh baby girl we’re doing it so big
I make these other niggas wanna do it like this
Oh baby girl we doing it so good
I keep on buying bottles if you keep on doing that
Go ahead and do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Tell them bring them fireworks to my table
Go ahead and do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
I’mma keep it moving, as long as you can do it

[Verse 2: T.I.]
We got buckets filled of ice, take the bottles all in
At the club Stuntin' hard stealin' all ya'll women
Never asked how we get em' Just ask how many, Now bow down to respect this pimpim'
Ain't no kids here, she high as I'm gone be next year
We leave the Club they meet us there, Oh nair back it in the air
Tatted on her dariar, and piercings where it's very rare
Ain't no sippin' N/E Player, We balling, we be everywhere
Her fly without a Parasail, she say I’m sweet as caramel
She rub my back and Cause what happened ended like a Fairy Tale
You better ask Tyrese about my freaks I did his 6's Not my weaks
You feel they purse I feel they cheeks, They Gentlemen but still ain't G
They Cali and Miami, When they standing at on table
See them bottles with them fireworks, Nowhere they are the way to go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Hold up, man, shawty let it way a nigga really count this cash
Wait a minute, shawty (whaaaat)
Better know a nigga really love the way you go and bounce your ass
Yall already know the shit that I be doin when a nigga come
And then I go and do it to the street and
Then I get upon the mic and
Then I'm walkin and I'm talkin and I'm strangling a nigga when I get upon the beat
Where the fireworkz bottles at? (hurry up!)
Go sit down while I pop shit up
Yall don’t want a problem
When I come and kinda step in the party
Niggas know I always fucks it up
DJ hear my verse then wanna cut shit up
Always keep your heater cuz I must grip up
No slouse kill a nigga no doubt
Like we in a coke house, everybody’s cut breaks out

[Hook]
