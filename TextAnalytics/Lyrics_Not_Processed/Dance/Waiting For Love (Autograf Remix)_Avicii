[Verse 1]
Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday, I was through with hopin'
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love

[Verse 2]
Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday, I was through with hopin'
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love

[Instrumental]
