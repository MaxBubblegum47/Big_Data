[Intro: bearface]
It's seven o'clock on the dot, I'm in the drop-top
Your legs on the dashboard (Your legs on the dashboard, oh)
So tell me what I'm to do whenever I'm missin' you?
Tell me, do you love me? I, I

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody's help
I've been lookin' after me like only I can watch my back
Lovin' me and it keeps hurtin' me
I hate it when I lose control over my heart
You know you really turned me on, right from the start
Just to hear you call my name, I call to God
Selfishly, I keep it all for me
Usually, I don't wait too long, but for you, I might

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty & Dua Lipa]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
I don't wanna blink and see you out (Haha, I don't, no shade)
Pressed up on my body, like no doubt (No, no, no doubt, no doubt)
I don't want us movin' too fast (Fast, play your part, play your part)
That's a damn shame, but it gon' make your man insane

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty & Dua Lipa]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 3: Jon B]
Show me all the sugar I've been patient for
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Show me all the sweet things you've got in store
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Where's the sweet thing, when I need some more, babe?
Show me some sugar when I'm feelin' lonely
Obvious why we relatin', baby, just don't keep me waitin'
Come be my sugar, baby

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty & Dua Lipa]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract & Jon B & Ryan Beatty]
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport (So don't run)
Taken my heart, all over again
Watchin’ my man, watchin' his body
Look at his body, oh-oh
Oh-oh (Passport)

[Outro: bearface, Joba & Kevin Abstract]
So, do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh
I'm your candyman
I'll be your candyman
I'm your candyman (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
(Candy, candy, candy, candy, uh)
I'm your candyman (Candy, uh)
I'll be your candyman (Candy, uh)
I'm your candyman
