[Intro]
Light turn the candle
I spark one for me
Let it float on the water
Right down to the sea
You draw back your curtain
A wavy goodbye
Lift up your arms
And look up to the sky
To the sky!

[Verse 1]
Stop me a candle
And keep it in the light
Thought it pairing window
And I come back tonight
You touch me in the darkness
I send you a sign
A give me your loving
And I’ll give you mine

[Chorus]
I’m maybe leaving
But I won’t be gone
I’ll be there when you want me
Above and beyond

[Verse 2]
You’re fading like I tell you
It’s all up to you
I’ll be there if you’ll need me
If I get it through
Reached on your settlers
And tomorrow you’ll find
Your souls had been touched
Are forever entwined

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yes I’m maybe leaving
But not for too long
I’ll be there when you want me
Above and beyond
