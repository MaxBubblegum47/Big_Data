[Verse 1]
Let's just take our time
There's nothing else to do
What better way to spend the night
Wasting it with you
The moon has won the war
The daylight waits to win
Stay here by my side
We'll watch the struggle start again

[Chorus]
I need you
Now and forever
To stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept
From me like a secret
And I swore I was through
Until you
Until you

[Verse 2]
The city's settled down
I watch you as you sleep
There's a silent celebration
For every breath you breathe
All this now makes sense
With you as company
I left all I knew and found
The better part of me
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I need you
Now and forever
To stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept
From me like a secret
And I swore I was through
Until you
Until you

[Bridge]
The time it took to find you
I would wait again, my baby
For the feelings that I feel with you now

[Chorus]
I need you
Now and forever
To stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept
From me like a secret
And I swore I was through
Until you
Until you
