[Intro: Luh Kel]
Nah-nah-nah-nah, oh, nah
Yeah, nah, nah, uh

[Chorus: Luh Kel & 
Lil Tjay
]
Girl, my mood changed when you walked through the door
Before you came, it was tears on the floor
Girl, you so perfect, I think that it's workin'
You gave me your love, now I really want more
Girl, you so different, apart from the rest
Cool, I dropped out, I don't really take tests
You gave me your love, I'm addicted like drugs
Girl, I think you the plug, you the one with the best
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (Wrong)
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (Wrong)
Girl, you did me wrong, you did me wrong (
Oh-oh-oh
)
You did me wrong, oh, oh, ayy (
Oh-oh-oh
)

[Verse 1: Lil Tjay]
How could you play me and do me like that?
Feelings rolled in and you should've felt bad
Never gon' lie, I'ma keep it a stack
I'ma wait 'til you realize that new nigga wack
I'ma just shit and keep doing my thing
When I hit the top don't you try to complain
I pour my heart out, tears falling like rain
Think this shit funny? Well, never, no games
You did me wrong, I thought we did get along
But like fuck it, you heard what this song
Now I got hits, karma's a hell of a bitch
Like who would've thought I'd be rich?
I won't forget, promise you, I won't forget
I swear you a hell of a chick, but that wasn't it
I thought I had someone legit
But who would of thought it'd be this?

[Chorus: Luh Kel]
Girl, my mood changed when you walked through the door
Before you came, it was tears on the floor
Girl, you so perfect, I think that it's workin'
You gave me your love, now I really want more
Girl, you so different, apart from the rest
Cool, I dropped out, I don't really take tests
You gave me your love, I'm addicted like drugs
Girl, I think you the plug, you the one with the best
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (Wrong)
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (Wrong)
Girl, you did me wrong, you did me wrong (That's right)
You did me wrong, oh, oh, ayy

[Verse 2: Luh Kel]
All by my side
Argue, let's talk, I need you by my side
You had my back when the gang used to slide
Now you gon' tell me you done with my time
I thought that I needed you in my life
All of them times that you talked, but you lied
Girl, you was down and you told me you roll like my Rollie
I'm done 'cause you lie with my guys, like nah
The only plan was to ball
Remember them times when we fall, but we got up and fought
I tried to leave, you would stall
Baby, I gave you my all, my all, my all
No car, we rode in the backseat
Yeah, you used to ride like a taxi
My heart fell so deep in the Black Sea
My heart fell so deep in the Black Sea

[Chorus: Luh Kel]
Girl, my mood changed when you walked through the door
Before you came, it was tears on the floor
Girl, you so perfect, I think that it's workin'
You gave me your love, now I really want more
Girl, you so different, apart from the rest
Cool, I dropped out, I don't really take tests
You gave me your love, I'm addicted like drugs
Girl, I think you the plug, you the one with the best
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (Wrong)
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (Wrong)
Girl, you did me wrong, you did me wrong
You did me wrong, wrong, wrong, ayy

[Outro: Lil Tjay]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
