Looking up there's always sky
Rest your head I'll take you high
We won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness
Why worry now
You'll be safe

Hold my hand, just in case
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness

This world can seem cold and gray
But you and I are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Nothing to fear but fear itself
We'll be ok just keep the faith
And we won't fade into darkness
