[Verse 1: Kaash Paige & 
6LACK
]
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, hope you smile when you listen (
Yeah
)
Ain't no competition, just competin' for attention (
Yeah
)
And you like, "I'm not on no games"
Well, baby, (
Woah
) I been peepin', and you ain't been the same
Like, who been on your mind? Who got your time?
Who you been vibin' with and why I can't make you mine?
You used to be textin' me, checkin' me, callin' me your slime
And now you treat me like my worth less than a dime

[Chorus: Kaash Paige, 
6LACK
, 
Kaash Paige & 6LACK
]
And if we paint a perfect picture, 
we can make it last forever
And you the only one I want to 
wear my orange sweater
I told you I am down 
for the worse or the better
But I keep sticking to you 'cause them 
four stupid letters
You got me singin' love songs (
Yeah
), love songs, love songs
You got me singin' love songs
, love songs, love songs (
Yeah
)
You got me singin' love songs, love songs, love songs (
Yeah
)
You got me singin' love songs (
Uh
), love songs, love songs (
Uh, yeah
)

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Hood therapy
Open my notepad, get to jottin' notes
Everything you sayin' inspirin', but have you tried a new approach?
Oh, 20-20, I see it clear
I'm not tryna "Little Fears" the love
But findin' love lookin' in the mirror
 (Love songs)
Ayy, B2K and them
It's a lot of hoes, but I don't play with them
I don't wanna lay with 'em (Lay)
Wouldn't start my day with 'em
Wouldn't even share shea with 'em, they be ashy
This for my baby, she classy, yeah (D4L)
And still down to fuck in the backseat, yeah

[Chorus: Kaash Paige, 
6LACK
, 
Kaash Paige & 6LACK

And if we paint a perfect picture, we can make it last forever (
Oh
)
And you the only one I want to wear my orange sweater
I told you I am down 
for the worse or the better
But I keep sticking to you 'cause them 
four stupid letters
You got me singin' love songs, love songs, love songs
You got me singin' love songs, love songs, love songs
You got me singin' love songs
, love songs, love songs
You got me singin' love songs
, love songs, love songs
