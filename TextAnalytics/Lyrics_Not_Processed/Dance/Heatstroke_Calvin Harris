[Intro: Young Thug]
Won't you please
Slow it down?
I'm tryna talk to you, darlin'
Tryna walk with you, darlin'
Do you hear me?
And no-no-no-no-nobody can stop it
The love you got from me
And every time, I look out at my seat today
They chase, they flash they flash, yes

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Tell me how you feel right now
'Cause all I wanna do is keep it real right now
I'm tryna beat it up, Beat Pills right now
Athletic in the sheets, I got skills right now
Break bread with some red baby hair
Ballin' in the club, Ace of Spades, yeah
Pop that bitch and spray it like 'Raid'
Yellow diamonds on you like a glass of lemonade
QB, I'll throw it
Teeth white, Newports
I want knees like shorts
80 thousand dollar Birkin bag in the Porsche
I'm tryna fuck with you 'til we on life support
I'll split it with you if we get half of Michael Jordan
No toilet tissue, I shit on niggas 'cause life is short (facts)
No passport to go with me, I had to get deported

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams  & Young Thug]
Release, let go, and have a good time
Have a good, have a good time, yeah
Have a good, have a good time
Release, let go, and have a good time
Let's have a good, have a good time, yeah

[Refrain: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
When you do things like this
And you set me free
How can anyone get tired?
When you do things like this
And you set me free
I think I've just been inspired
Oh babe

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Jeffery!
Brand new chapter of a real you
She got every red bottom like a baboon
Hunnid' bottles in the club, real one room
Girl you gotta keep up with a boss move
King of the jungle, tycoon
Everybody thinking that's a cartoon
We just wanna party, way back in the war room
Do you want some? No I don't, son
Tryna watch me ballin', do you want money?
I'm just tryna turn up, tryna work something
Shawty suck the dick good, she wanna fuck it first
Hey mista, you a rat burn
Good hair down her back
Rich nigga, I like 'em ratchet
Fuck it up, throw it back
No shave, Brazilian wax

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams  & Young Thug]
Release, let go, and have a good time
Have a good, have a good time, yeah
Have a good, have a good time
Release, let go, and have a good time
Have a good, have a good time, yeah

[Refrain: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
When you do things like this
And you set me free
How can anyone get tired?
When you do things like this
And you set me free
I think I've just been inspired
When you do things like this
And you set me free, boy
How can anyone get tired?
When you do things like this
And you set me free
I think I've just been inspired

[Outro: Pharrell Williams & Ariana Grande]
Hey, hey
I could sweat like this all night
Oh, heatstroke, oh
I think you opened my eyes
