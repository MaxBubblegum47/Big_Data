[Verse 1]
Under the beauty lies something I can't explain
This ain't a movie, we fall out then we start again
What is the reason that I pull these false alarms?
All I want is to hold you in my arms
Don't make it harder than it really has to be
Take off your armor, one thing I can guarantee
Is I'll be in misery for as long as we're apart
All I want is to hold you in my arms
Hey!

[Chorus]
Everyone knows that I'm a fool without you darling
Everyone knows I'm in the dark (woah)
I don't ever want to see you anyplace but here
Wrapped up just like a present in my arms

[Verse 2]
Who ever knew I'd be the one to beg and plead
Yes, it is true I've done things that I won't repeat
That is the reason that you won't let down your guard
And let me wrap you up inside my arms
My little angel could you please hear me out
I miss the hazel mixed with the green in your eye
What is the reason that all my favorite scars
Came from tryna hold you in my arms

[Chorus]
Everyone knows that I'm a fool without you darling
Everyone knows I'm in the dark (woah)
I don't ever want to see you anyplace but here
Wrapped up just like a present in my arms
