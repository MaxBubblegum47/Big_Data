[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
I ain't never made of nothin'
I'm always hittin' the change button
My publicist ain't say nothin'
Just to keep me out of trouble
I ain't never made of nothin'
I'm always hittin' the change button
My publicist ain't say nothin'
Just to keep me out of trouble (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Just to keep me out of trouble, ah
Last year we hit a double, ah
Told my niggas add another, yah
Shit was smooth, no fumble, yah (Ooh)
Then I dropped when we tussled, ah
Back then when we struggled, ah
No one cared about the juggle, ah
Can you see me, ee?

[Chorus: JOBA]
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
All these voices on the sidelines
Feel like doubting lies, like what's in my head
Difference is a year ago, they were not there
Difference is a year ago, they did not care
Difference is a year ago, nobody felt like they would have to tell me, "Don't forget where you come from"
But I loved my city when they didn't love me
Ain't it funny when you in that conundrum?
I ain't one for all of your corruption, nigga
I don't move at your presumptions, nigga
Now we ride your repercussions, nigga
Do we look like fuckin' stuntmen, nigga?
I ain't gone, I ain't function, nigga
I was overdue for an eruption, nigga
You ain't even have the heart to face me when your problems changed me
Go fucking figure

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Just to keep me out of trouble, ah
Last year we hit a double, ah
Told my niggas add another, yah
Shit was smooth, no fumble, yah
Then I dropped when we tussled, ah
Back then when we struggled, ah
No one cared about the juggle, ah
Can you see me, ee?

[Chorus: JOBA]
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
I woke up on tour bus
I woke up on aeroport
Man I really dropped out
With no promise this would work
Man, I really dropped out
With no promisin', promisin', promisin', promisin', promisin'
You an astonishment! You an astonishment!
Look at my conglomerates, look at what we did
They said we was kids, was tryin' to live
Instead we made millions, boy I'm resilient
Boy we made millions, boy we made millions, boy we made millions

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Now we ain't gotta wait 'til devil
Big guilt cop over the sinner
To Ruby set black through the canyon
I spit on memory lane
Our lovin' is all that remains
Dust off and I'm keepin' my pace
I'm talkin' to wind today
Chalk it up, it's weird today
My momma pop bottles, it went to the roof
FL this money, now keep it on loop
Food for all of my wounds
In times of solitude

[Chorus: JOBA]
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down

I'ma work it out in my lifetime
Wouldn't trade it all in my right mind
I'm too drunk tonight, pack a punch, I might take a bullet for you
(That one day someone--)
To be truthful, I'd hate on me too
'Cause no one deserves what I want, no one is worthy
I'm selfish as fuck, I know that it's wrong
At least I admit it, I wish that I didn't
I don't know why I do it, always had the feeling
That one day someone would listen
, listen
Maybe this route ain't what it's made out to be
Even though I wanted it forever
Never in my life has it been so hard to be
Maybe I could be better, maybe I would do better
If it wasn't so hard to be myself
When you get to shinin', they'd rather see you dying, nobody likes it

[Outro]
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
