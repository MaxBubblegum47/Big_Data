[Intro: Noah Cyrus]
I thought you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Kicking up doubt when it's sore
It's going to be covered in dark
You came all this way for a door, watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All or nothing aren't the same score

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION & Noah Cyrus]
(I thought you got all you came for)
Thought I lost my mind
With the pastor preachin', or the picture paintin'
With a heart embracin'
Ever since, from the Southside
Sorted out in a archive, for the black price, suitcase and a black tie
How profound, I find it funny
No explainin' how I lost my self
But I'm chillin' in the bookshelf
With a pocket knife, slit your wrist with your act to right
Such is life
Ecstacy, slit wrist, and a vagabond
Vagabond, vagabond, you're my ecstasy

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION, Noah Cyrus, Both]
Ah-ah
Are you tasting me?
But I miss you and I hate you
Ah-ah
But I need you, and I love you more
Every minute
Ah-ah
In January, and December, I want you
Ah-ah
You're my ecstasy

[Refrain: Noah Cyrus & XXXTENTACION]
Shut it down, going to take you outside (Oh)
Sifting up a reason from the lonely dirt (Woah, woah, woah)
When it’s over, you’ll be golden (Woah, woah, woah)
Over, over (Over, over, over)
Shut it down, going to take you outside (Woah, woah, woah)
Sucking up the dust from your static crown (Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God)
Oh, just to turn away, and you'll be golden (Hello, hello)
Over, over (Woah, What? What?)

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
I think you got all you came for
But do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Is it gonna be right this time?
Is it gonna be golden?
Is it gonna be right this time? (Right, right, right, oh)

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION & Noah Cyrus]
Push drugs in my pocket
I'ma pull it out and then pop it
I'm a common case of a ganja blaze
And my mind is fading quite frankly (Oh)
It's a tricky course, never that way
Give my mind a question
What kind of sorcery is this?
Dark night and a night eclipse

[Break: XXXTENTACION]
Lacy, Lacy, Lacy
One more request
Release my pain (Ha)

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
Did you think you got all that you came for?
Lover, lover
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
I think you got all you came for
But do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia

[Outro: Noah Cyrus]
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone
