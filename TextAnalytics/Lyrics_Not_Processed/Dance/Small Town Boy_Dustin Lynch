[Verse 1]
I'm a dirt road in the headlights
I'm a mama's boy, I'm a fist fight
Kinda county line, kinda cold beer
Little hat down, little John Deere
I kinda give a damn
I kinda don't care
You see that girl standing right there

[Chorus]
She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'm turning it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me

[Verse 2]
She likes my T-shirt
She likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance to some old school
She'll take a full moon over those city nights
And I ain't scared to get all up in them bright lights
Yeah, I can smooth it out
I can stick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough of

[Chorus]
A small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'm turning it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
She loves a small town boy like me, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm her sure thing
I'm her go to
I'm her rock solid
She ain't gon' ever lose a-

[Chorus]
Small town boy like me
I'm her ride or die baby
I'm her cool, I'm her crazy
I'm her laid back in the front seat
I'm so with you till the end girl
Let's turn it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be

[Chorus]
She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'll turn it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
She loves a small town boy like me
Yeah, she loves a small town boy like me
