[Verse 1]
Her body's gold like September
She burns through the night like an ember
And all those things we tried forgetting I remember
But we say we all fine we all fine
Sunny day dreams and we up now
Vodka lemonade I serve it up it goes down
75 degrees and a dope sound
All you need to live fine to live fine
A little sunshine cause she need it
A dose of rainfall in the evening
The waves crash down and we feel them
Say here’s to the nights we steal them
And I be running cause I figured out
The more I slow down the less I get out
And if we fall lets be strong now
Moving along we don’t mind we don’t mind

[Chorus]
All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won’t fire
No need to leave, spend our whole lives
Another day in paradise

[Verse 2]
I be gone till November
Going through the letters that I send her
And think about the moment that I met her
Well I’ll be back in due time in due time
Touchdown throw off my own two shoes
Still the same city I be used to
And all the reckless things that we do
Keep us young, they're good signs they're good signs
Take a little more if you need it
Voices of the night won’t mislead it
The tide pulls me in but it takes slow
Here’s to the nights we let go
And I’m hoping that they figure out
It’s all about the scenery along the route
No fears and no problems
These moments are so kind, they're so kind

[Chorus]
All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won’t fight
No need to leave, spend the whole night
Another day in paradise

[Bridge]
I don’t need what I’ve sowed
I just need something good
And I know when we’re old
We’ll look back and say “some
Mistakes we made, they made us who we are
These games we played they got us really far"
That shit to most won’t ever mean a thing
But it got us here, so I hold on

[Chorus]
All the good, comes in waves
I bide my time by the ocean
And at night, I’m awake
To feel the wake of your motion
And I want something that’s feeling alright
Loose cannon but still it won’t fight
No need to leave, spend the whole night
Another day in paradise
