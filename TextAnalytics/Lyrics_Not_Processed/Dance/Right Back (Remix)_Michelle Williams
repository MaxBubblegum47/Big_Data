[Intro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Ooh

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Watch  'nother Richard
It's  a million plus three reasons I lied
I couldn't admit it
And I just don't want you to waste my time
'Cause  I'm tryna get with ya
I  be feelin' down but I'm fine when I'm with ya
You be thinkin' I be lyin' when I say I miss you
Girl,  you know I'm on your body, on your body like a tissue
They be callin' you Illuminati when I'm with you (Illuminati when I'm with you)
I say, "Maybe, it's your third eye," I love your mental (Third eye, I love your mental)
VVS's on me look like Now and Laters
, lick you up
I  bet you never go back to the guy that was with you (Guy that was with you)
She got every pair of Chanel out of SoHo
Tribeca, hit the city to show off
And when you get dressed up, you take hours
Baby girl, you know you can do whatever, you got...

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I've been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place, mmh, nah
It's crowded
In LA, but I'll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you're down, I could show you around if you're really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

[Chorus: Khalid]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Verse 3: Khalid]
Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it's cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we've been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Bridge: Khalid]
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (Bring it back to me, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (Bring it back to me, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (No no, no, oh yeah)

[Chorus: Khalid]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right
