[Intro: Trevor Rich]
Stepped out of my zone (My zone)
I had to get out all alone (Alone)
And figure it out on my own (My own)
And I know what I really want now
Can't stop me, can't break me (Can't break)
What don't kill me, gon' make me (Gon' make)
Shoot for the stars, no safety (No safety)
And now I see clear in HD

[Chorus: Trevor Rich]
Gotta go hard (Gotta go hard)
I ain't got time to waste (I ain't got time)
I gotta go high (Gotta go high)
I gotta elevate (I gotta elevate)
They wanna fight (They wanna fight)
I'm just gon' let 'em hate (I'm just gon' let 'em hate)
I gotta go high (Gotta go high)
I gotta elevate (I gotta elevate)

[Post-Chorus: Trevor Rich]
You better choose a side, you gotta choose a side
You gotta pick
You better do what's right or you gonna lose the fight
You gotta (Gotta go hard)
You better choose a side, you gotta choose a side (I'm just 'gon let 'em hate)
You gotta pick (Gotta go hard)
You better do what's right or you gonna lose the fight (I gotta elevate)

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
I'm a web-slinger to a gunslinger
No millimeter, this is my arena
I'm the black widow with a bad stinger
And I'll make you scream like a bad singer
I'm everything that you wanna be plus more
Since there's no heroes anymore
Jump out the window, then put the mask on
Who the bad man that a man gotta bash on?
Hope we'll never link up
Blink and you will see us
Thumbprints 'bout to ink up
See me in the NYC
You can never swing by me
Hope we'll never link up
Blink and you will see us
Thumbprints 'bout to ink up
See me in the NYC
Home of the B.I.G, look
They will slander me, I just plan to be
Somethin' powerful for my family
Try to balance life and my sanity
Show a different side of humanity
So amazin', keep appraisin'
Save you from a home invasion
Chasin' robbers from the bank
You facin' friendly neighborhood Spider-Man

[Chorus: Trevor Rich]
Gotta go hard (Gotta go hard)
I ain't got time to waste (I ain't got time)
I gotta go high (Gotta go high)
I gotta elevate (I gotta elevate)
They wanna fight (They wanna fight)
I'm just gon' let 'em hate (I'm just gon' let 'em hate)
I gotta go high (Gotta go high)
I gotta elevate (I gotta elevate)

[Verse 2: YBN Cordae]
Okay
I fight crime through the nighttime
When the light shine, I go python
I've fallen, on my last lifeline
There's no way in my right mind
My city up on my back tight
How can I possibly act right?
I'm Robin Hood, I'm the Black Knight
I know you heard 'bout my last fight
'Cause I win, over and over again
Battlin' evil, I'm hopin' to win
Fightin' my demons, I'm nice for a reason
Enticed with the bleedin', I'm showin' my sins
How can you expect me to stay sane? Protect me
My technique go X speed on high waves and jet skis
I jump off this building to save these civilians
My strength and my honor is trusted by children
I'm ready and willing to fight all these villains
No chaos or killings, my style is so brilliant

[Chorus: Trevor Rich]
Gotta go hard (Gotta go hard)
I ain't got time to waste (I ain't got time)
I gotta go high (Gotta go high)
I gotta elevate (I gotta elevate)
They wanna fight (They wanna fight)
I'm just gon' let 'em hate (I'm just gon' let 'em hate)
I gotta go high (Gotta go high)
I gotta elevate (I gotta elevate)

[Post-Chorus: Trevor Rich]
You gotta choose a side, you gotta choose a side
You gotta pick
You gotta do what's right or you gonna lose the fight
(I gotta elevate)

[Verse 3: SwaVay]
Look, I ain't got no time to be hangin' around
Nobody tryna figure out if they good or evil
I'm fightin' the crimes, savin' your lives
One at a time, I'm killin' the rhymes
I do it for the people
I'm Peter Parker running through the 6 with a bag full of tricks
My boy, you better choose a side
I may have lost the battle but I will not lose the war
I can promise you I will not lose this time
And I did it all independent, no really, all independent
Now we winnin', I got my homies cookin' up in the kitchen
Intuition, so we gon' have to win and come for some business
The world is mine and you gon' have to pay me attention
And I did everything that I did on my own
I'm a one-to-one for real, there can never be a clone
Better talk to me nice, better watch yo' tone
And I'm puttin' on for my home zone so I gotta go hard

[Chorus: Trevor Rich]
Gotta go hard (Gotta go hard)
I ain't got time to waste (I ain't got time)
I gotta go high (Gotta go high)
I gotta elevate (I gotta elevate)
They wanna fight (They wanna fight)
I'm just gon' let 'em hate (I'm just gon' let 'em hate)
I gotta go high (Gotta go high)
I gotta elevate (I gotta elevate)
