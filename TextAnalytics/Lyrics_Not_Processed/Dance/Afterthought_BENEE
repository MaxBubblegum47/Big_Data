[Verse 1: Sinneyy]
Lately,I’ve been worried about the things you do
And I was missing the thought of you,yeah
Maybe was it confusion, (no way,no way,no way) (whyyyyy)
Was it infatuation? (Oooo)
Praying you’ll come to realise i was a friend to you (ahhh)
Cause I’m sorry for making it turn this way (oh)
Yeah, I know things have changed,I know (du-du-du)
Yeah, But least this isn’t goodbye,yeah (no goodbyes)

[Chorus]
So Lost in this past life
So lost I thought it was goodbye
Don’t leave me on this highway
I need you to shine bright
When life gets to complicated
Please stand with me after dark
I’ll stay in the limelight
Like a beautiful afterthought
Like a beautiful afterthought

[Verse 2: BENEE]
Sometimes, you'd ask me for something different
Hated when you did it, I wish that you didn't
I would do things and you'd get annoyed, I
Should've never done them, I wish I was different
Why do we have to step away now?
It's been a year, been a couple days now
Since you called me sayin' you're worried
Been hard for me dealin' with this space now
No company, wishin' we could sit down
'Cause I'm sorry, but you don't want me

[Chorus]
So Lost in this past life
So lost I thought it was goodbye
Don’t leave me on this highway
I need you to shine bright
When life gets to complicated
Please stand with me after dark
I’ll stay in the limelight
Like a beautiful afterthought
Like a beautiful afterthought

[Outro: BENEE & Sinneyy]
I don't wanna forget about you
I don't wanna forget about you, oh
I don't wanna forget about you
I don't wanna think about it
Think about it
