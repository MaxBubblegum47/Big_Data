Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Uh, technical difficulties
Me and my niggas been thinkin' about, yeah
Gettin' up out of this house, hey
I've been thinkin' about Enrique
And Davion, man, yeah
I love this song, man, yeah
Iove the brackets, got all my niggas back together
Love to have it, love to see it
How you been? Still dreamin'
European, my daddy texts me a bunch
Am I ever text a nigga back?
Back, back, back in the day
All of a sudden, that's before, 'fore, yeah, back
Stuck in heaven, tryin' peaches just like, hey
Still young, hopin' it is
Feelin' back home, handle my business
I had the vision but hey, man, I guess you can't do the business
Think back to house, still, these are my niggas for real
This is that real, real, real
Sittin' on top of the ceilin'
This is my nigga, for real, those are my family, sure
Think I'll marry 'em, yeah
This is my nigga, for real
Those are my family, sure
Think I'll marry 'em, yeah

[Verse 2: Ryan Beatty]
Flyin' through the breezes
Only wind can touch my skin
All these roses that come, back to back in my head
But something's missing
But time still tickin'
And it's breakin' me slow, my Lord
Caught crying in the corner
But something's missing

[Interlude: August Royals]
Give me some free time. Feel like I'm stumbling again. Let me see some red lights [?]. It's like I'm goin' ninety-five in a school zone. Too fucked up to realize I'm speeding, impacting lives, I jeopardize everybody I run into, what? [?] Got people crashing around me, gettin' lit up like a b-day candle. Remember when we were five and bein' lit was something that didn't involve no Grey goose handle? Life changes, man, not for the best. Nostalgia is innocent, something you could never repossess. I still start dancing in the rain. Other times I wish I was a teardrop, though. Maybe a raindrop ain't so bad falling from the sky. Sometimes I think about fallin' from the sky myself, and it's not in the right way. Nobody asked me to be this way, I'm just inside
