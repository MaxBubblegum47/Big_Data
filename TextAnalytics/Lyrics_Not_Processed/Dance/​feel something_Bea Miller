[Verse 1]
If I could choose anything
I would be good in bed one day
I would fall into love and stay
I'd fall into love

[Pre-Chorus]
And it’s not fair
I keep on writing a sequel to stories
I know that are not there
I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live like this

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again

[Verse 2]
If I am telling the truth
Watching my friends break their hearts into two
Makes me jealous, I know that it’s cruel
But what can you do?

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's not fair
I keep on writing a sequel to stories
I know that are not there
I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live like this

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again

[Bridge]
Can you tell me a secret?
Can you tell me what's wrong with me?
I know I should be angry
But I can barely feel a fucking thing
Can you tell me a secret?
Can you tell me what's wrong with me?
Can you tell me what's wrong with me?

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel
Something really real, so that I can really
Feel like a person again

[Outro]
Can you tell me a secret?
Can you tell me what's wrong with me?
I know I should be angry
But I can barely feel a fucking thing
Can you tell me a secret?
Can you tell me what’s wrong with me?
Can you tell me what’s wrong with me?
