[Chorus: Lee Spielman]
Cardboard crutches
Support the weight of the world
Ashes to ashes
Blossom and burn

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Eany, meany miney, moe, you got a fucking problem?
Ashes for blossoms, thrashing and problems
Golf trash possums, wait, talk, goblin
Stray you rat, gay sack, rubber grip, gay strap
Push your fucking day back
Every fucking day's black
Every bloody always now, speaking lion's always down
The stories shit but I want to watch you cut and bleed
All these lies, and cuts, and pleads, I want to watch disease

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Trash Talk in the black hawk
This the shit that make all the kids pull the gats out
Fucking blast off, go ahead and grab the chainsaw
And take your cast off with your mask off (Trash Wang)
Now, watch the guitar riff, hit them drums with a large stick
And hope you hear that fucking bass, trying to sit still in the fucking mosh pit
Talking trash I'm breaking bad, and snorting glass, my port is head
Because out my mind, I'll show you fucks, Doc TC in a fucking demon pit

[Chorus: Lee Spielman]
