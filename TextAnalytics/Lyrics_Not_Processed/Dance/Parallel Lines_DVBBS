[Verse 1: Happy Sometimes]
There's a force stronger than us
But this love I can't ignore (can't ignore)
We run the same course
But we never touch
My body attracts yours (attracts yours)

[Pre-Chorus: Happy Sometimes]
What if I am your missin' piece
What if we mess with destiny
What if the definition of we
Is two people in time livin' their own lives
Like two parallel lines
That'll never that'll never collide
Steady, I just keep on hoping
That one of us will find
Find a way we can intertwine
Steady I just keep, I keep on hoping

[Chorus: Happy Sometimes]
On hope by you, on hoping
On hope by, by you keep
(I keep on hoping)
On hope by you, on hoping
Parallel lines by, by you keep
(I keep on hoping)

[Verse 2: Happy Sometimes]
Another day
I see you runnin' away from the way that you look at me
Just look at me, yeah
Why you don't change
Just cause the weather is cold, that don't mean that we're losing it (losing it)
Aren't you wondering

[Pre-Chorus: Happy Sometimes]
What if I am your missin' piece
What if we mess with destiny
What is the definition of we
Is two people in time livin' their own lives
Like two parallel lines (two parallel lines)
That'll never that'll never collide (never)
Steady, I just keep on hoping
That one of us will find (one of us will find)
Find a way we can intertwine
Steady I just keep, I keep on hoping

[Chorus: Happy Sometimes]
On hope by you, on hoping
On hope by, by you keep
(I keep on hoping)
On hope by you, on hoping
Parallel lines by, by you keep
(I keep on hoping)

[Pre-Chorus: Happy Sometimes]
Like two parallel lines (two parallel lines)
That'll never that'll never collide (never)
Steady, I just keep on hoping
That one of us will find (one of us will find)
Find a way we can intertwine
Steady I just keep, I keep on hoping

[Chorus: Happy Sometimes]
On hope by you, on hoping
On hope by, by you keep
(I keep on hoping)
On hope by you, on hoping
Parallel lines by, by you keep

[Bridge: Happy Sometimes]
Like two parallel lines
That'll never, that'll never collide
Steady, I just keep on hoping (keep on hoping)
That one of us will find (parallel lines)
Find a way we can intertwine
Steady, I just keep (I keep on hoping)

[Outro: Happy Sometimes]
Like two parallel lines
That'll never, that'll never collide
Steady, I just keep on hoping
