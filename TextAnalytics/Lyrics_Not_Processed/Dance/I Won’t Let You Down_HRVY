[Verse 1]
I wish that we could just talk
But I don't really know where to start
Yeah, you got every right to be mad
After all of the things that I said
I know I didn't deal with things properly
But now I'm tryna be the man I supposed to be
If I don't then I'll live the regret
'Cause I hate that I left you upset

[Pre-Chorus]
Threw your keys on the table
Said that I was ungrateful
And I thought I was strong, ohhh

[Chorus]
I know I hurt you
Never said 'I love you'
But I'll say it now
And you should know that
I'm not gonna hold back
This time around
If you give me another chance
I won't let you down
If you give me another chance
I won't let you down

[Verse 2]
I know I messed up but to tell you the truth
I was too busy hanging out with my crew
You were so cool with it ain't no excuse
I should spent a little time with you
Instead of just playing around, messing about that
I was in the driver seat but who's the passenger now
Sat here trying to figure out
Same song going round and round

[Pre-Chorus]
Threw your keys on the table
Said that I was ungrateful
And I thought I was strong, ohhh

[Chorus]
I know I hurt you
Never said 'I love you'
But I'll say it now
And you should know that
I'm not gonna hold back
This time around
If you give me another chance
I won't let you down
If you give me another chance
I won't let you down

[Bridge]
There are some things that we can not change
No, we can't go back in time
But I hope that it isn't too late
To give it another try, oh, I

[Chorus]
I know I hurt you
Never said 'I love you'
But I'll say it now
And you should know that
I'm not gonna hold back
This time around
If you give me another chance
I won't let you down
If you give me another chance
I won't let you down

[Outro]
If you give me another chance
I won't let you down
