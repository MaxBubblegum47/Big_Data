[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Take off at a speed of sound
Bright lights, colors all around
I'm running wild, livin' fast and free
Got no regrets inside of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Not lookin' back
Not givin' up
Not letting go
I'll keep on running

[Chorus]
I'm gonna reach for the stars
Although they look pretty far
I'm gonna find my own way
And take a chance on today

[Post-Chorus]
The sky with stars so bright
The colors feel so right
I've never felt like this, I'll keep on runnin'

The sky with stars so bright
The colors feel so right
Just take my hand, we're gonna reach for the stars

Tonight!

Tonight!

[Verse 2]
Wake up, livin' day by day
Do what I want, and I'll do it my way
The world's flying right below my feet
Got no regrets inside of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Not lookin' back (Not lookin' back)
Not givin' up (Not givin' up)
Not letting go
I'll keep on running

[Chorus]
I'm gonna reach for the stars
Although they look pretty far
I'm gonna find my own way
And take a chance on today

[Post-Chorus]
The sky with stars so bright
The colors feel so right
I've never felt like this, I'll keep on runnin'

The sky with stars so bright
The colors feel so right
Just take my hand, we're gonna reach for the stars

Tonight!

Tonight!

[Interlude]

[Post-Chorus']
I've got it in my sight
The colors feel so right
Got my feet off the ground, I'll keep on runnin'

Oh, I can feel it now
The colors all around
Just take my hand, we're gonna reach for the stars

[Post-Chorus'']
Just take a chance (Just take a chance)
We'll do it right again
(We're gonna reach for the stars)

Just take my hand (Just take my hand)
We'll take a chance tonight
Reach for the stars

Tonight!

Tonight!
