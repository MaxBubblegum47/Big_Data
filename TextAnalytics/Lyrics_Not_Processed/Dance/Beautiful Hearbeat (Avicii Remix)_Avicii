[Verse 1]
My blood's infused with you
Oh, I don't know what to do
I breathe your air, you're in my lungs
I need to fool my heart for once

[Verse 2]
I know our days are counted
Walk into worse the end
Look deep into my eyes and
Remember I'm your friend

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't cry
Don't, don't
Please don't cry

[Chorus]
You really should've seen it coming
Opened your eyes
You're dying to pick all the pieces up
Well, I don't
You make me want to rip my heart out
Erase my mind
We're stuck and there is no escaping now
Please don't cry

[Post-Chorus]
Don't, don't
Please don't cry
Please don't cry
Please don't cry
I really should've seen this coming
Please don't cry
You make me want to rip my heart out
Please don't cry

[Verse 1]
My blood's infused with you
Oh, I don't know what to do
I breathe your air, you're in my lungs
I need to fool my heart for once

[Verse 2]
I know our days are counted
Walk into worse the end
Look deep into my eyes and
Remember I'm your friend

[Pre-Chorus]
Please don't cry
Don't, don't
Please don't cry

[Chorus]
You really should've seen it coming
Opened your eyes
You're dying to pick all the pieces up
Well, I don't
You make me want to rip my heart out
Erase my mind
We're stuck and there is no escaping now
Please don't cry

[Post-Chorus]
Don't, don't
Please don't cry
Please don't cry
Please don't cry
I really should've seen this coming
Please don't cry
You make me want to rip my heart out
Please don't cry
