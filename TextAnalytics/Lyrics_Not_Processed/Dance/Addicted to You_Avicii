[Verse 1]
I don't know just how it happened; I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
Wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
I'm out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you

[Verse 2]
Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room
Got me hypnotised, I'm getting high on the perfume
I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'mï»¿ addicted to you
