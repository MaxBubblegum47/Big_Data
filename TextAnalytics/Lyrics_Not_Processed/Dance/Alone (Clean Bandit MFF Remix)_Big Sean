[Chorus: Halsey]
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
You'll wish that you never did

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey & Big Sean]
Everywhere I go I (pull up)
Got a million different (look)
People tryna kick it (pull up)
But I'm still alone (look)
Everywhere I go I (pull up)
Got a million different (look)
People tryna kick it (pull up)
But I'm still alone...in my mind (look)
Pull up, look
Pull up, look
Pull up, look
Pull up, look
Pull up, uh (look)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I'm a real rare individual
I'm in the physical and the metaphysical (yeah)
I know you need your alone time, that's critical
But I need some of your time, is that hypocritical?
Damn, you know I relate to you more than fam
So I won't sit around and let you sink in quicksand
Look, I know you got million dollar plans
And you tryna build a brand, live a life in high demand
Swerving big b's, your bag got little G's
Gucci down to the socks like Biggie and Little Ceas'
Let's hit the Maldives and hide behind palm trees
Little red wine, weed, and a calm breeze
'Cause baby, you been living life inside a bubble
When the last time you had somebody hug you?
Hold up, when the last time you had somebody love you?
Hold up, when the last time you love someone who love you?

[Bridge: Halsey & Big Sean]
