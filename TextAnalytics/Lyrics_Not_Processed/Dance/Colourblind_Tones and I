[Verse 1]
Sweet talks on a Sunday afternoon
Never hold you down, all the wilds and the truth
And I know that you'll remember me‚ oh‚ back in time
But you stay on my‚ oh, you stay on my mind
Wild weeks, no sleep‚ now you're colourblind
But you're always there to share a smile
And I know sometimes get rough
You feel like you've been left behind
But you stay on my, oh, you stay on my mind

[Chorus]
But you stay on my‚ oh, you stay on my mind
But you stay on my, oh, you stay on my mind
But you stay on my, oh, you stay on my mind
But you stay on my, oh, you stay in mind

[Verse 2]
Hot night, rave lights, we sit outside
But we see more than just the stars
We're all caught up in our worries
We forget just where we are
We forget just where we are
Big steins, red wines, broken guitars
'Cause we're free and we're young at, hmm
And I know you won't remember me, oh, back in time
But you stay on my, oh, you stay on my mind

[Chorus]
But you stay on my, oh, you stay on my mind
But you stay on my, oh, you stay in my mind
But you stay on my, oh, you stay in my mind
But you, oh, you stay in mind, mmm

[Outro]
Sweet talks on a Sunday afternoon
Never hold you down, all the wilds and the truth
And I know that you'll remember me, oh, back in time
But you, well, you stay on my, oh, you stay on my mind
