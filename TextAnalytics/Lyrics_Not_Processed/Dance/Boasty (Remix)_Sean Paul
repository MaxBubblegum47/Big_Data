[Chorus: Wiley & Sean Paul]
Boasty, boasty
Godfather, man a OG
Man a half humble, man a boasty
Fling a ragga riddim like it's 03
Boasty, house on the coast G
My money's so long it doesn't know me
It's looking at my kids like I'm boasty

Man a half humble man a boasty
Fling a ragga riddim like it's 03
Boasty, house on the coast G
My money's so long it doesn't know me
It's looking at my kids like I'm boasty
I fly around the world 'cause I'm boasty
