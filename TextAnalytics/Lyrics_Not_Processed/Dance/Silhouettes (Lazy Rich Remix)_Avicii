Press play, fast forward
Nonstop we have the beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the sunshine

We will never get back to
To the old school
To the old rounds, it's all about the new found
We are the newborn, the one who wanna bounce
We are the future and we are here to stay

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back
At the faded silhouette

Straight ahead on the pathway before us
Day by day, soon the change will come
Don't you know we took a big step forward
Just either way, we're gonna pull the trigger

And we're gonna get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds
It's all about the new founds
We are the newborn
The one who wanna battle the sky
We are the future and we are here to stay

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back
At the faded silhouette
