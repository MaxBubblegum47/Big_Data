[Intro: Tyga]
Hahah, I don't give a fuck, shit
Ahhh-ah-ah-ah-ah, hah!

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Young Nino, fuck a bitch in a peacoat
Carlito, Scarface, Al Pacino
Bun B though, Pimp C, R.I.P though
I goes deep in that pussy; Dan Marino
She wanna be the one, fuck her to my own single
Break a bitch heart, no future; Miss Cleo
Snapback, au-au-automatic reload
Flyer than a fucking beetle, you can’t beat 'em
Hah, vampire fuck up your evening
I pop up and eat lunch, leave you in the cement
Don’t believe it? Stripe like A-fucking-didas
The gun Selena, give a nigga Bieber fever
Hah, hah, real fucking hot
Put it in pot, take a shot, higher than a tube sock
You's a bop, give me top top as I load the whop
Man these niggas say I’m fly but to her I’m God

[Chorus: Tyga]
I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, and I don’t give a fuck

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Fuck is up? Niggas stomping in my Chucks
Yeah I make it reindeer cause I’m all about my bucks
Use the butt up in the front, d-dick up in her cunt
And I put it in her hole, hole-in-one, putt putt
Aughh! Su-Super McNasty
Why you McLovin w
hen the bitch call me daddy?
Pimp, no caddy, she wish she never had me
Treat her like a dog (dog) called the bitch Lassie (hah!)
Young savvy, bang her like Cincinnati
Above average, f-fly like I’m Aladdin
They bend backwards, thr-throw the pussy at them
I’m Ben Wallace, dunk up in your basket (haha)
U-uh, balls in the air
No games, I’m serious, double dare
There’s too many bitches, why these niggas wanna stare?
Pat Ron up in here, nigga this ain’t no beer

[Chorus: Tyga & 
Lil Wayne
]
I’m faded faded faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded (
yeah
)
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, and I don’t give a fuck

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Mama, there go that monster
Abracadabra, Magic Johnson
My motherfucking doctor said I need a doctor
So I called House, now I am a pill popper
Faded like skinnys, Young Money we winning
I told her if I change, she won’t get a penny
Milking this shit, pregnant bitch titties
Bringing home the bacon, I’m fucking Miss Piggy
Loaded like a semi, send me naked pictures
She knows my dick, she call that nigga Richard
Prior to me cumming, I had to stick my thumb in
Her ass one time, smell my finger, make you vomit
Flyer than a hornet, the shoe fit; I worn it
She tried to jack me off, can’t beat it, join it
Tunechi, coochie, that what she call it
Flag, scarlet, I killed it, mourning

[Chorus: Tyga & 
Lil Wayne
]
I’m faded, faded, faded ,faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded (
yeah
)
My nigga, I’m faded faded faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded (
uhh
)
My nigga, I’m faded faded faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded (
Young Mula baby!
)
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, faded
My nigga, I’m faded, faded, and I don’t give a fuck
