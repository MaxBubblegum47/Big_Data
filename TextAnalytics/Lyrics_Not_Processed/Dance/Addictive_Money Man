[Intro]
(EJ Beats)

[Chorus]
I rock Balencis, them runners
Just fired up a blunt of Gelato with Stunna, my wrist is a tundra
Came home with this bitch and I shoot at a couple
Killin' 'em softly, I'm killin' 'em subtle
Came from the dirt, let me shout out my hustle
Yeah, I just fucked you, but can't say I love you
They say I just mumble, but with this trap shit, I'm a lyricist
Niggas be squares, but disguisin' appearances
Her pussy addictive, them hundreds addictive
I shoot with the quickness, I burn down a village
I'm hacking in shit, I'm an internet villain
I had to work out in the gym
Was fat, now I'm gettin' real slim
They not respectable men
They turned they back on they friends
I bring your life to an end

[Verse]
He talkin', then death come to him
Super Bowl ring, I'ma win
My jewelry gon' shine when it's dim
A hundred bags on their way in
I love to touch on her skin
Who is he? I don't know him
They sing my shit like a hymn
Solid, can't break, I can't bend
Swerve a Lam', bent up a rim
I like my bitches all-natural
Every verse I recite, it be factual
Growhouse, I cut down the stem
I'm on a thirty-day cleanse
Gorilla Glue fog up my lens
Fornication, tonight we gon' sin
Gotta put up some M's for my kids
I went from a Neon to pushing a Ghost, she just wanna elope
I spent three racks just to slip in this coat, I just heavily smoke
Workin' like I'm with QC
But I ain't got a contract with Pee
When I went broke, I hit my knees
Movin' in silence like G's
Lil' bro gon' weigh up them P's

[Chorus]
I rock Balencis, them runners
Just fired up a blunt of Gelato with Stunna, my wrist is a tundra
Came home with this bitch and I shoot at a couple
Killin' 'em softly, I'm killin' 'em subtle
Came from the dirt, let me shout out my hustle
Yeah, I just fucked you, but can't say I love you
They say I just mumble, but with this trap shit, I'm a lyricist
Niggas be squares, but disguisin' appearances
Her pussy addictive, them hundreds addictive
I shoot with the quickness, I burn down a village
I'm hacking in shit, I'm an internet villain
I had to work out in the gym
Was fat, now I'm gettin' real slim
They not respectable men
They turned they back on they friends
I bring your life to an end
