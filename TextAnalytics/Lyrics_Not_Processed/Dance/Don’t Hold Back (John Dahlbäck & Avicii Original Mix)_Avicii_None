You and me, we've come so far
Quitting now would be a waste of
Good love, good love for all
Days and weeks and years we never
Gave up, gave up on us
Even though we had our struggles
I still feel you like before

Don't hold back

Like before

You and me, we act as one
Holding back silly ego's
You see, we can't be wrong
Can't be wrong, not if i say
Happily, take what you need
I'm yours, how you want me
I still feel you like before

Don't hold back
The love that ties us together
Is oh so strong
Don't hold back
If I can't have you here
Don't know if i could carry on

Don't hold back
The love that ties us together
Is oh so strong
Don't hold back
If I can't have you here
Don't know if i could carry on
