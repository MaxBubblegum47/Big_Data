[Intro: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci
GoldLink
Shy Glizzy
D.C., E.A

[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man, yeah
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank
Don't hold no rank

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci! (Wop!)
Don't get mad in this bitch 'cause you too bad for this shit
How the relationship gon' last if he not having no chips
You need a man, buy you bags, have you bragging and shit
You need no man without no plan, doing all that nagging and shit
Well it's Gucci Mane and GoldLink, and we got gold sinks
I just bought my chick a cold mink, damn what them hoes think
Brought the Lambo up to D.C. so they can see me
Got Shy Glizzy with me, but ain't nothing shy about me
Spend a week with Gucci and I boost your self-esteem
Every time I ball, you ball, we ball, girl we a team
Dining with the King so you get treated like a queen
Got us shining like the diamonds on my necklace, watch and rings
Brrr!

[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man, yeah
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank
Don't hold no rank

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Dirty ass, Maryland ass nigga
With a sick ass mouth and a slick ass flow
Got your bitch around me, nigga, ain't no playin' when
I'm comin' for the kitty, I'm a fool, goddamn
Do it for my niggas on the coast right there
Do it for my niggas in the ghost right now
Niggas got killed for the boy live his dreams in the hills
And they watchin' for the boy right now
Goddamn, what a time, what a year, uh
We are what them young boys fear, uh
I kill, never been killed, that's real, no lies
You can tell that from our peers right now
Bet you wanna fuck me now, uh
Bet you wanna love me down, uh
Girl, you can't tie me down like Ray J said
But know I'm down, uh
Freaky Deaky show me somethin', uh
Shake it like you owe me somethin', uh
Pushin' on the pussy like a button
Came four times, fifth time you gushin', uh
Still gettin' rowdy in the function, uh
Bitches on my dick like it's nothin', uh
Everywhere I go now, always got shit
Bbumpin', jumpin', thumpin', jumpin', yeah

[Verse 3: Shy Glizzy (Young Jefe)]
Hey, nice to meet, I’m Young Jefe, who you be?
Got my piece in Southeast, got her clappin' to this beat
She invite me to her crib, I walk in, she see my heat
She said, "But I live in the hills," bitch, that’s just the way I sleep
Stop that madness, I'm a savage, in traffic with MAC 11’s
Bad bitch and she Spanish, I fly her to Calabasas
We get nasty, I'm her daddy, she know a nigga ain't average
Ain't nothin' wrong with fake asses, bitch, turn around let's make magic
I'm geekin', uh huh I'm on it, don't look at me like you want it, no
Tell 'em that we ain't stuntin', in fourth down we ain't puntin' it
King of District of Columbia, can't come here without a permit
This shit really a jungle, gorillas and anacondas, hey!

[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man, yeah
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank
Don't hold no rank
