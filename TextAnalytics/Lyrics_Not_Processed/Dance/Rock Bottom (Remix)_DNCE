[Verse 1: Hailee Steinfeld]
What are we fighting for?
Seems like we do it just for fun
In this, this stupid war
We play hard with our plastic guns
Breathe deep, bottle it up
So deep until it's all we got
Don't speak, just use your touch
Don't speak before we say too much

[Pre-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
That you hate me now and I feel the same way
You love me now and I feel the same way
Scream and we shout
And make up the same day, the same day

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
We're on the right side of rock bottom
And to you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
You get under my skin
More than anyone's ever been
But when we lay in bed
You hold me harder 'til I forget

[Pre-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld & Joe Jonas]
That you hate me now and I feel the same way
You love me now and I feel the same way
Scream and we shout
And make up the same day, the same day

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld & Joe Jonas]
Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
We're on the right side of rock bottom
And to you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

[Post-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld & Joe Jonas]
Keep on coming back for more
Cause we keep on coming back for more

What are we fighting for?
Seems like we do it just for fun
In this, this stupid war
We play hard with our plastic guns

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld & Joe Jonas]
Oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
And I hope that we keep falling
We're on the good side of bad karma

We're on the right side of rock bottom
And to you, I just keep crawling
You're the best kind of bad something
'Cause we keep on coming back for more

[Post-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld & Joe Jonas]
Keep on coming back for more
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
Keep on coming back for more
'Cause we keep on coming back for more
