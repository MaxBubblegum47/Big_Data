[Verse 1]
Let's go out and be wild
Do it while we can (Do, do)
Runnin' free in the world
We've got all weekend (Do, do)

[Refrain]
Tear it up, tear it down
Gettin' lost in the sound of our hearts beatin'
Take me here, take me now
Gettin' lost in a crowd with you

[Chorus]
Up, all night
I waited for you all my life
Hold my hand and keep me close
I'll never let you go
No not tonight
Keep me by your side
Keep me by your side
Keep me by your

[Breakdown]
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, your-your-your-your-your-your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side
Keep me by your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, your-your-your-your-your-your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side
Keep me by your side

[Verse 2]
Scattered hearts, broken glass
I don't feel a thing (Do, do)
'Cause I'm frozen in time
When you're next to me (Do, do)

[Refrain]
Tear it up, tear it down
Gettin' lost in the sound of our hearts beatin'
Take me here, take me now
Gettin' lost in a crowd with you

[Chorus]
Up, all night
I waited for you all my life
Hold my hand and keep me close
I'll never let you go
No not tonight
Keep me by your side
Keep me by your side
Keep me by your

[Breakdown]
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, your-your-your-your-your-your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side
Keep me by your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, your-your-your-your-your-your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side, your
Side, side, side
Keep me by your side
