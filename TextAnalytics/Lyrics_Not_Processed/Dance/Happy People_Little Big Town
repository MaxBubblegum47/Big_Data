[Verse 1]
Happy people don't cheat
Happy people don't lie
They don't judge, or hold a grudge, don't criticize
Happy people don't hate
Happy people don't steal
Cause all the hurt sure ain't worth all the guilt they feel

[Chorus]
If you wanna know the secret
Can't buy it, gotta make it
You ain't ever gonna be it
By takin' someone else's away
Never take it for granted
You don't have to understand it
Here's to whatever what puts a smile on your face
Whatever makes you happy, people

[Verse 2]
Happy people don't fail
Happy people just learn
Don't think they're above the push and shove
Just wait their turn
They always got a hand, or a dollar to spare
Know the golden rule or what you're goin' through
Even if they never been there

[Chorus]
If you wanna know the secret
Can't buy it, gotta make it
You ain't ever gonna be it
By takin' someone else's away
Never take it for granted
You don't have to understand it
Here's to whatever what puts a smile on your face
Whatever makes you happy, people

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
These days ain't always easy to find
They're the ones that you want standing by your side
No time for greed, if they need some, give 'em a slice
And we'll all be happy people

[Outro]
Well, life is short
And love is rare
And we all deserve to be happy while we're here
