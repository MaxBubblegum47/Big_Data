[Verse 1]
Step out into the dawn
You pray 'til, you pray 'til the lights come on
And then you feel like you've just been born
Yeah, you come to raise me up
When I'm beaten and broken up
And now I'm back in the arms I love

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died
I think I just died

[Chorus]
And went to Heaven
And went to Heaven
And went to Heaven
I think I just died and went to Heaven
And went to Heaven
And went to Heaven

[Verse 2]
Beaten and bathed in blood
I'm hit by, I'm hit by your love and drug
And now you've c-come to raise me up

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died

[Chorus]
And went to Heaven
Went to Heaven
Whoa, and went to Heaven
I think I just died and went to Heaven
And went to Heaven
And went to Heaven
