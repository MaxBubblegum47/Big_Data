[Intro]
Oooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Oooh, ooh-ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
Oh, there's a river that winds on forever
I'm gonna see where it leads
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted
I'm gonna stand on the peak

Out there's a land that time don't command
Wanna be the first to arrive
No time for ponderin', why, I'm a-wanderin'
Not while weâ€™re both still alive

[Chorus]
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
If you won't, I must say my goodbyes to thee

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Oh, there's an island where all things are silent
I'm gonna whistle a tune
Oh, there's a desert that size can't be measured
I'm gonna count all the dunes

Out there's a world that calls for me, girl
Headin' out into the unknown
Wayfarin' strangers and all kinds of danger
Please don't say I'm going alone

[Chorus]
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
Well, if you won't, I will say my goodbyes to thee

[Verse 3]
I was a-ready to die for you, baby
Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay
What good is livin' the life you've been given
If all you do is stand in one place?

I'm on a river that winds on forever
Follow 'til I get where I'm goin'
Maybe I'm headin' to die, but I'm still gonna try
I guess I'm goin' alone

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
