[Verse 1]
Sound of your voice
Relinquish the pain in my heart in the night
In the down of your choice
It's got me caught in this spark of the fire

[Pre-Chorus]
But, I can't hold my breath
If you just keep leading me on
And I can't hold you back
But it's all that I want

[Chorus]
You keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time
You caught me around, spinning around
All of the time
Still running away like you do
I'm chasing your heart like a fool
You keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time

[Verse 2]
Make up your mind
Cause you're playing my life that strings of a guitar
Lay it down, at the door
I'm at the corner, I can't take it no more

[Pre-Chorus]
But, I can't hold my breath
If you just keep leading me on
And I can't hold you back
But it's all that I want

[Chorus]
You keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time
You caught me around, spinning around
All of the time
Still running away like you do
I'm chasing your heart like a fool
Keep coming- keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time

[Bridge]
I can't make your heart want me
You put in my strength to the test
I can't scream my words into the
'Cause I'm just wasting my breath
Wasting my
Wasting my
Cause I'm just wasting my breath

[Chorus]
You keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time
You caught me around, spinning around
All of the time
Still running away like you do
I'm chasing your heart like a fool
Keep coming- keep coming up, keep coming down
All of the time
