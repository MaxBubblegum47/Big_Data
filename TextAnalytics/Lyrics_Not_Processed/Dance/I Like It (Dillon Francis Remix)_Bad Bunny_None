[Intro]
Yeah baby, I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like–

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stunting, I like shining
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Bitch I'm signin' (Signin'!)
I like those Balenciagas (Those), the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch (Cha-ching)
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance (What?)
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't (She can't)
They call me "Cardi Bardi", banging body, spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (Coupe)
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though (Sorry)
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)
Yeah, they call me Cardi B, I run this shit like cardio

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I like it like–
I said I like it like–
I said I like it like–
I said I like it like that

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Oh, I need the dollars (Cha-ching!)
Beat it up like piñatas (Ah)
Tell the driver, close the curtains (Skrt!)
Bad bitch make you nervous (Prr!)

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
Chambean, chambean, pero no halan (Halan!)
Tú compras to'a las Jordan, bo', a mí me las regalan (Huh-huh)
I spend in the club (Wuh), what you have in the bank (Yeh)
This is the new religion bang in latino gang, gang, yeh

[Interlude: Bad Bunny]
Bad Bunny, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 3: J Balvin]
I said it like it like that
Como Celia Cruz tengo el azúcar (Azúca')
Tu jeva me vio y se fue de pecho como Jimmy Snuka (Ah)
Te vamos tumbar la peluca
Y arranca pa'l carajo, cabrón, que a ti no te vo'a pasar la hookah
Mis tenis Balenciaga me reciben en la entrada (Wouh)
Pa-pa-paparazzi, like I'm Lady Gaga (Wouh)
Y no te me haga', que en cover de Billboard tú has visto mi cara
No salgo de tu mente, donde quiera' que viaje' has escuchado "Mi Gente"

[Bridge: Cardi B & 
J Balvin

I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that, that, that, that
That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that
I said I like it
 like that

[Post-Bridge]
I said I like it like–
I said I like it like– (Woo')
I said I like it like–
I said I like it like that

[Outro: Cardi B]
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that
