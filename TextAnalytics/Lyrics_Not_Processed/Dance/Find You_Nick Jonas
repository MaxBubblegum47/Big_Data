[Verse 1]
I look for you in the center of the sun
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb
I see your face even when my eyes are shut
But I never really know just where to find you
I chase the words that keep falling out your mouth
You got a logic I'll never figure out
If I could hold you then I'd never put you down
But I never really know just where to find you

[Chorus]
Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I-
Try, try, try, but I, but I-
Try, try, try, but I-
But I never really know just where to find you

[Verse 2]
You think you know how to get under my skin
It's good for now but it's never permanent
Knock on the door but there's no one listening
And I never really know just where to find you
You look for love but you never really try
You say it's not but it's always on your mind
Keep chasing gold but you lose a silver line
But I never really know just where to find you

[Chorus]
Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I-
Try, try, try, but I, but I-
Try, try, try, but I-
But I never really know just where to find you

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm chasing a feeling
Maybe I don't even need it
Maybe you're looking for me tonight, tonight
I look for you in the center of the sun
I took a pill but it didn't help me numb
I see your face even when my eyes are shut
But I never really know just where to find you

[Chorus]
Where to find you
Where to find you
But I never really know just where to find you
Try, try, try, but I-
Try, try, try, but I, but I-
Try, try, try, but I-
But I never really know just where to find you
