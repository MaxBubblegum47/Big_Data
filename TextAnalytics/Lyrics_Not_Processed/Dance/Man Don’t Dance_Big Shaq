[Intro]
Increase the volume ting, yo
Big Shaq (Raw sauce)
It's another one
They said one and one is two
That was me and you
But we ain’t stuck like glue (
Swifta production
)
Ahh, boom!

[Verse 1]
I like my eggs with the yolk (Scrambled ting)
But please don't burn my toast (Keep it neutral)
She wants me to be her bloke (Baby boy)
But she can't cook Sunday roast, ah (Shocking)
You can’t deny-y-y (Can't deny)
You looked in my eye, eye, eye (Right in my eye)
When I walk by-y-y (By)
'Cause you know that I'm fly-y-y
Fly boy, they call me
Let's turn you and I to we (Fresh ting)
She said "boy, you're silly"
Then ran for her bus quickly
No oyster, I didn't chase it (Never chase)
I just jumped in the whip and I paced it (Skrrt)

[Refrain]
She started laughin', umm-in’ and ahh-in’
I said "man, this girl is stallin'"

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "babes, I’m a big man (Big man)
I got big plans, they call me Big Shaq
I make the ting go quack from way back (Skidi-kat-kat)
And I made "Man's Not Hot", you know you like that"

[Chorus]
She wanted to vibe, man don't dance
Looked in my eyes, man don't dance
One, two step, man don’t dance
Flex on your ex, man don't dance
She stepped on my creps, man don't dance
Touch my chest ('Low that), man don't dance
One, two step, man don't dance
Man don't dance, man don't dance

[Verse 2]
Skidi-ah-pa-coo-too-coo-boom (Coo-too-coo)
Skidi-ki, a-toom-toom (Poom-poom)
Brother, push back (Push back)
Oh, that's your girl? Her wig's wack (Take it off)
Then she started movin' shy (Movin' shy)
I'll take you to Dubai (To Dubai)
We'll eat breakfast in the sky (Burj Khalifa)
Tell them other man bye (Bye)
Tell 'em bye-bye, she gave me side-eye
Listen, babes, I'm actually a nice guy (I'm a nice guy)
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good try
But if I text you, are you goin' to reply?"
You might decline, then I rewind
But you stay there, 'cause it's all fine

[Refrain]
She started laughin', umm-in' and ahh-in'
I said "man, this girl is stallin'" (Come on)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "babes, I'm a big man (Big man)
I got big plans (Big plans), they call me Big Shaq (Big Shaq)
I make the ting go quack from way back
And I made "Man's Not Hot", you know you like that" (You like that)

[Chorus]
She wanted to vibe (Quick vibes), man don't dance
Looked in my eyes, man don't dance
One, two step (Left step), man don't dance
Flex on your ex (Wasteman), man don't dance
She stepped on my creps, man don't dance
Touch my chest ('Low that), man don't dance
One, two step (Left step), man don't dance
Man don't dance, man don't dance

[Verse 3]
Man don't dance (Never dance), but I'll glance (I'll look)
You wanna ride? (Skrrt) Take your chance (Take it now)
She looked at me and made a stance
I feel like MC Quakez with balance (Balance)
She said, "Surely, you got some moves"
Mmm, mmm, babes, I do, mhmm
Show me what you can do (Aiight), aiight
Boom, I'ma take you through
So I just one, two, step then I slide
Man, I just one, two, step then I slide
So I just one, two, step then I slide
Man, I just one, two, step then I slide
So, said she wants to try-y-y (Try me)
I'm no instructor, so bye-ye-ye ('Low that)
Man don't dance, I'm not that guy-y-y (Never dance)
Don't ask me why-y-y

[Chorus]
She wanted to vibe, man don't dance
Looked in my eyes, man don't dance
One, two step, man don't dance
Flex on your ex, man don't dance
She stepped on my creps, man don't dance
Touch my chest ('Low that), man don't dance
One, two step, man don't dance
Man don't dance, man don't dance

[Outro]
You don' know
Skidiki-pap-pap
Two fingers, pap-pap
It's Big Shaq, yo
Man don't dance, man don't dance, man don't dance
We can vibe, but man don't dance
Man don't dance, man don't dance
You don' know
Uh, skrrrah!
