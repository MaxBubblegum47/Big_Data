Oh yeah, alright
Are you gonna be in my dreams, tonight?
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
And in the end the love you take
Is equal to the love you make
