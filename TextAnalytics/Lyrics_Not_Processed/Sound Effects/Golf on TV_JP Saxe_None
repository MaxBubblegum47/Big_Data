[Verse 1: Lennon Stella]
I woke up to the bed made
And you're downstairs
Doing the dishes
And my mom's there
She's kind of obsessed with you
I think that I might be too
She thinks that you're good for me
That's not something I'm used to

[Pre-Chorus: Lennon Stella]
I keep getting overwhelmed
When I talk about us out loud
'Cause I want you and only you
It's simple as you want me too

[Chorus: Lennon Stella]
Some people wanna switch it up
Like just one love could never be enough
But some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me
Some people think it's supposed to hurt
Like it couldn't be real if it's putting you first
But some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me

[Verse 2: JP Saxe 
with Lennon Stella
]
You just been so consistent
That stability
It's so healthy
It's confusing me
I'm done with romanticizing
Dysfunction and compromising
You treat me so well, it's weird
But I love how much I like it

[Chorus: Lennon Stella & JP Saxe]
Some people wanna switch it up
Like just one love could never be enough
But some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me
Some people think it's supposed to hurt
Like it couldn't be real if it's putting you first
But some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me

[Bridge: Lennon Stella & JP Saxe, 
Lennon Stella
]
If the old me met the new me
She'd
 probably try to stop me
But I want you and only you
It's as simple as you want me too

[Chorus: Lennon Stella & JP Saxe, 
JP Saxe
]
Some people wanna switch it up
Like just one love could never be enough
(
Never be, never be, never be enough
)
But some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me
Some people think it's supposed to hurt
Like it couldn't be real if it's putting you first
(
Putting you, putting you, putting you first
)
But some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me
