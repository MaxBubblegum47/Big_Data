[Verse 1: Walker Hayes]
Before I even learned to play a note, I was on stage
Mastering the art of selling myself at a young age
Fear and insecurity drove me like a Maserati
High school was like showing up at a costume party
I was a comedian, an athlete
A golden boy, a black sheep
Whatever I had to be to make the world throw candy at me
And college was the same act, different play
It was October 31st every day
And the real world was an all too familiar street
Another trick, another treat

[Pre-Chorus: Walker Hayes]
Then I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Every mask I ever wore
Shattered like glass on the floor
And it was like

[Chorus: Nicolle Galyon]
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace

[Verse 2: Walker Hayes]
Hell, I don’t know why I’m like this
But what would it change if I knew
Maybe my parents messed up
But, hey, they’re just dressed up kids too
Maybe I guess what I’m trying to say is I love you
For being somebody I’m not ashamed to introduce my skeletons to
I still put on my Superman cape and hide in it
But when I’m with you it comes untied for a minute
Hits the ground in the shadow of your skin
For the first time I was comfortable in mine

[Pre-Chorus: Walker Hayes]
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Every mask I ever wore
Shattered like glass on the floor
It was like

[Chorus: Nicolle Galyon]
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace

[Pre-Chorus: Walker Hayes]
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Every mask I ever wore
Shattered like glass on the floor
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
(When I knocked on your door)
Every mask I ever wore
Shattered like glass on the floor
It was like

[Chorus: Nicolle Galyon & Walker Hayes]
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace

[Outro: Nicolle Galyon & Walker Hayes]
Halloween ended
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
To all the people I pretended to be
Halloween ended
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Halloween ended
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
To all the people I pretended to be
Halloween ended
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Rest in peace
