[Verse 1]
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo

[​​Interlude]​​
Go home

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo

[Electric Piano Solo: Billy Preston]

[Verse 2]
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta

[Guitar solo: John Lennon]
Hoo
Go home

[Chorus]
Oh, get back, yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Ooo

[Outro]
Get back, ooh
Thanks, Moe
