[Chorus: James Blake & Chance the Rapper]
Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Now we’re at square one
Life ain't been 'round here in a minute
Here ain't been 'round my whole life
And we waited too long
Chaos been 'round for a minute
Marketed, bottled it up
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first, save yourself first

[Verse 1: James Blake]
Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Now we’re at square one
And we waited too long
So we’re back to square one

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Why every time I land in London, land of Lincoln all on my mind? (IGH)
I plan to plane it back after playin' a packed show in due time
I'm 'round about I bought a round of English ale for my pals
A bouncer sold a ounce of rubbish weed to me for like 200 pounds
I think my English's getting real real bad
Cause this dumb bitch said I'm real real bad
No sprechen sie Dumb but I'm real, real good
Dark skinned Mike but I still feel bad
I'm a chill pill addict
I wonder if God's still magic
I wonder if Nas stillmatic
Down under the north it's still havoc
Why I run around wonderin', wanderin', ponderin' life
Life 'round here, when
Life ain't really been 'round here in some times
Sometimes it's no one 'round here

[Chorus: James Blake & Chance the Rapper]
Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Now we’re at square one
Life ain't been 'round here in a minute
Here ain't been 'round my whole life
And we waited too long
Chaos been 'round for a minute
Marketed, bottled it up
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first, save yourself first

[Outro: Chance the Rapper & James Blake]
I ain't been 'round here in a minute
But you ain't been 'round a whole lot
My flesh went through the peoples in this peephole
And sealed the keyhole and kept the door locked
Part time love is the life 'round here
And wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first, save yourself first
Part-time love is the life 'round here
We're never done...
Save yourself first
