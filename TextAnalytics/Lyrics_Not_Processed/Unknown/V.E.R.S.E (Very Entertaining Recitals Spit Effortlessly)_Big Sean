[AnnaMaria Cardinalli]
Here is a verse
Unlike any verse
To a song that you've never heard

[Hook: Malik Yusef]
Good music team break hearts and bones
So here is a verse full of sticks and stones
Good music team break hearts and bones
So here is a verse full of sticks and stones
So for your feelings and your health
You better leave us alone
Yeah we from the go but we already gone
So for your feelings and your health
You better leave us alone
Yeah we from the go but we already gone

[Verse 1: Malik Yusef]
So for your self-esteem
I guess Hollywood would make a scene
And we both on the same scene
But in reality in between
There’s a ravine
I am a beast
The Godzilla
Chicago rilla
King of the Kong
Won’t let you bridge the gap or cross the law
The {??} pulled up with something with the roof missing
Was all on YeYe’s blog
If they say your roof is missing it only means you lost your dog
And unfortunately his name was Lucky
But I’m moving swift with two rabbit’s feat rocking horse shoes rolling a four-leaf clover
For you it’s over
I will not introduce you to Shawn Carter but I will help you meet Jehovah
And I don’t mean the CEO of Roc-A-Fella
But your girl is off to see me throw up the stone
So she leave with the stone
Ya’ll go home alone and
Beat off like a a capella

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Now all across the world and atlas
I hop on top of tracklists and tend to show my ass bitch
I see when you respected highly, highly
They gon try to shoot you from the neck up like an I.D
Try me
Man, I’m just trying to get the world to hear my records
Break real records
Grindin’, Ryan Sheckler
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louis Vuitton Sean
Up in Benny Han Han eating all the wonton
Rosé rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John
I guess she want a nigga that’s more real
That’s the end of the story like the moral
So fuck a boyfriend and whatever they on
If he trying to took a lot
You could call me State Farm
Aim for the head on
Got your bitch loggin’ on
‘Cause I’m all over the web like I got 8 arms

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Malik Yusef]
If this was a movie, this’d be the terror scene
I am not a human, I am a [??]
I breathe ether and spit kerosene
I stumble in the cypher drunk
Rocking red and black hyper [??}
Calling the wanna-be MC all types of punks
So don’t gladiate with me if you not into pain
I survived on a wing and a prayer until I got in a plane
I turn my money into something just not into rain
I’mma stand for something till I made in my plot of terrain
I leave sentence fragments in they heart if not in they brains
Got venom in my saliva, somehow not in my veins
I’ll wearing all white while watching a dark comedy and not gotten a stain
Walk up with his blood boiling and got in a drain
Hide the abolitionist, remove his neck from his chain
Are you not entertained?

[Hook]
