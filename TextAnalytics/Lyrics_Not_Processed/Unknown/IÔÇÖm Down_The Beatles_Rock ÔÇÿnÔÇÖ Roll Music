[Verse 1]
You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me

[Chorus]
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down

[Verse 2]
Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Same old thing happen everyday

[Chorus]
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down?

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
We're all alone and there nobody else
You still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"

[Chorus]
I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down?
Wow! Baby, I'm down

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you know I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh yes, I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down on the ground (I'm really down)
Ah, down (I'm really down)
Oh baby I'm upside down, a yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm down (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm feeling upside down (I'm really down)
Ooh, I'm down (I'm really down)
Baby, I'm down yeah
Oh baby, I'm down, yeah
Baby, I'm down (I'm really down)
Well baby, I'm down (I'm really down)
Well, baby baby baby (I'm really down)
Oh baby, I'm down
I'm down, down, down, down, down, down
