Pass your mother, lose your brother
Be a lover, too
Well all together make it better
You gotta cry free

Bridges burnin', eyes are turnin'
Now they're learnin' fools
They're gonna talk it over
While they're talkin'
You gotta cry free

Cry free

Fists are shakin', homes are breakin'
Know what's makin' blues
Oh true convictions, satesfaction
While you cry free
