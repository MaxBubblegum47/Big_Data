[Intro]
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
I am not your homie, not your ho—
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me
What you-what you gon' do?

[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah, time is money so don't fuck with mine
See I'm out with my girls, I'ma have a good time
Step back with your chit-chat, killin' my vibe
Oh, oh, woah, oh, ah

[Refrain]
See, I can't get too much of a good thing, mmm
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things, woah
Please hold your tongue, don't say a damn thing

[Pre-Chorus]
See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" "Oh no, I'm just passin'"
"Do you wanna drink?" "Nah, thanks for askin'"

[Chorus]
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
I am not your homie, not your ho—
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah

Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah

[Interlude]
I mean, we could throw shapes together
But it doesn't mean you're in my circle, yeah

[Verse 2]
Cruise through life and I'm feelin' on track
If you can't keep up, then you better fall back, uh
'Cause money look better when I see it all stacked up
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Refrain]
See, I can't get too much of a good thing, mmm
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things, woah
Please hold your tongue, don't say a damn thing

[Pre-Chorus]
See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" "Oh no, I'm just passin'"
"Do you wanna drink?" "Nah, thanks for askin'"

[Chorus]
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
I am not your homie, not your ho—
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
I am not your homie, not your ho—
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah

[Bridge]
Come 'round here, just know though
Won't get what you want, what you want, what you want, want
Tell you what you don't know
I get what I want, what I want, what I want, want

[Pre-Chorus]
See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" "Oh no, I'm just passin'"
"Do you wanna drink?" "Nah, thanks for askin'"

[Chorus]
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
I am not your homie, not your ho—
Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah

[Outro]
You don't know me, fuck yeah
