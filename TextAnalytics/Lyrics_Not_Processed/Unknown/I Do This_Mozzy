[Intro: Sinister Pook]
Longwinded, running through this life like it was mine
Never settling, but setting every goal high
One thousand burpees on the path to my own destruction or success
But what is a mistake without the lesson?
See, the best teacher in life is your own experience
None of us know who we are until we fail
They say every man is defined by his reaction to any given situation
Well who would you want to define you?
Someone else or yourself?
Whatever you do, homie, give your heart to it
And stay strong

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Lot of niggas fail, but I won't
Lot of niggas fold, but I cope
Lot of niggas gone, but I'm home
Lot of niggas off, but I'm on
Lot of niggas lost on this road
Couple niggas gave up their goal
Gang of niggas traded their soul
But me, I'm standin' on ten toes
Lookin' out my Benz window
Wonder where'd my friends all go
Scared to give my heart to this girl
Paranoid she gon' leave if my ends get low
No one in this game to be played
But I'm knowin' that this game to be changed
I should be afraid of afraid
I'm just tryna live up to the meanin' of my name
I'm just tryna live up to them niggas in my gang
I'm just tryna live up to my moment on the stage
I'm just tryna live up to the truth in my pain
And the power that they gave me in the youth of today
I put a coupe in the safe
And I shoot from the waist
My time is money
And I ain't got a second for you flukes and you fakes

[Hook: Young Thug]
I do this shit for my woes
I do this shit for my niggas
I do this shit for my bros
I do this shit for my niggas, yeah
I do this shit for my woes
I do this shit for my niggas
I do this shit for my bros
I do this shit for my niggas, yeah

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
We've been takin' trips more than often this month
When I call they pullin' up, 2, 3 stream up
You ain't do enough for the clan, how I feel
If I gotta shut it down, how the film gon' feel?
120 in the Euro, one hand on the wheel
I was just broke, ran through a quarter mil'
Can't believe I'm still here, shed tears for the dead
Cubes in my 30 chain, she don't even wear
Call my little brother up, you know we took it there
Real nigga tellin' on me, only thing that I fear
Yeah, only thing that I fear
Real nigga tellin' on me, only thing that I fear
Lotta niggas queers, lotta dope in the air
Lotta niggas queers, lotta dope in the air
Styrofoam contaminated, got a nigga meditatin'
Yeah, I said it got a nigga meditatin'
I can't even eat 'less I'm medicated
I can't even sleep 'less I'm medicated
I've been on my feet chasin' check after check
Nigga, week after week, 'cause I'm dedicated
I can't even eat 'less I'm medicated
I can't even sleep 'less I'm medicated
I've been on my feet chasin' check after check
Nigga, week after week, 'cause I'm dedicated

[Hook: Young Thug]
I do this shit for my woes
I do this shit for my niggas
I do this shit for my bros
I do this shit for my niggas, yeah

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Thugger!
I do this shit for my mothafuckin' niggas
I'm gettin' this money, yeah
I do this shit for them Benjis
Like you ain't real or hood, no Tommy gun
I do this shit for my niggas
Pull up with Barettas, nigga, and just go BRRRT
I do this shit for them bad bitches
Wearin' red bottoms and Jimmy Choo
I do this shit for my daughter
I do this shit for my mama
I do this shit for my son, ayy, ayy
I do this shit for my brother
I do this shit for the world
I do this shit for the globe
I do this shit right here, nigga
And I do that shit, why y'all fuck with the boy?
I'm wet like a boat
I'm lovin' my chickens
I smoke and I choke
I do it for my brothers
I do it for my folk
Got 40s on me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nigga shoot from the toes
All the way up to the top
All the way up to the top
