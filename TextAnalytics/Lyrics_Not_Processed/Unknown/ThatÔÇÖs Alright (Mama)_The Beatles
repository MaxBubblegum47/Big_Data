[Chorus]
Well, that's alright, Mama
That's alright with you
Yeah, that's alright now, Mama
Just anyway you do
That's alright, that's alright
That's alright my Mama, anyway you do

[Verse 1]
Well Mama, she done told me
Poppa done told me too
Said, "Son, that girl you're fooling with
She is no girl for you"
That's alright, that's alright
That's alright my Mama, anyway you do. Woh

Well, I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Then you won't be bothered with me

Hanging around your door
That's alright, that's alright
Yeah that's alright my Mama, anyway you do

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ya da di dididi
Ya da di dididi
Ya da di dididi, I need your loving
That's alright, that's alright my Mama, anyway you do
Yeah, that's alright my Mama, anyway you do
