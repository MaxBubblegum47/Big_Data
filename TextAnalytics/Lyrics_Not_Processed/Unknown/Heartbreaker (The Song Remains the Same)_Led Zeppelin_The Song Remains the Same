Hey, fellas, have ya heard the news?
Ya know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
All the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new, but the face is the same as it was so long ago
B' from her eyes, a different smile like that of one who knows

It's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die by the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace from the Lord above

People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at
A-one thing I do have on my mind
If you could clarify, please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name
When I try to make love, I got to make love
I really need to make love
Ooh, yes, every night, every night
Give it to me, c'mon

[guitar solo]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
