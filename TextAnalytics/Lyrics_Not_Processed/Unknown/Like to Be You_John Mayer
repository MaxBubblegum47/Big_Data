[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
"Don't cry" - or do
Whatever makes you comfortable
I’m tired too, there's nothin' left to say
Let’s call the truce, 'cause I don't really wanna go to bed like this

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle
I'm so sorry
'Cause in the moment I

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I don't know what it’s like to be you
I don’t know what it's like but I’m dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
Can I kiss you or not? 'Cause I’m not really sure right now of what you want
Are you still mad at me?
I'm hopin' not
'Cause maybe we could go to the movies, I know that always cheers us up, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle

'Cause in the moment I

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you
Tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you

Every time we
Every time we argue and get caught up in the moment

[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Julia Michaels]
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you
So tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like
