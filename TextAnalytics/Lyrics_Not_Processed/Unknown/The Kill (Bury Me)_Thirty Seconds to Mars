[Verse 1]
What if I wanted to break? Laugh it all off in your face
What would you do?
What if I fell to the floor? Couldn't take this anymore
What would you do, do, do?

[Chorus]
Come, break me down, bury me, bury me
I am finished with you

[Verse 2]
What if I wanted to fight, beg for the rest of my life
What would you do, do, do?
You say you wanted more, what are you waiting for?
I'm not running from you, from you

[Chorus]
Come, break me down, bury me, bury me
I am finished with you
Look in my eyes, you're killin' me, killin' me
All I wanted was you

[Bridge]
I tried to be someone else, but nothing seemed to change
I know now, this is who I really am inside
Finally found myself fighting for a chance
I know now, this is who I really am
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh...

[Chorus]
Come, break me down, bury me, bury me
I am finished with you, you, you
Look in my eyes, you're killing me, killing me
All I wanted was you

[Outro]
Come, break me down, break me down
Break me down!
(You say you wanted more) What if I wanted to break?
(What are you waiting for?)
(I'm not running from you) What if I, what if I, what if I, what if I
Bury me, bury me...
