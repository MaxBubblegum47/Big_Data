Booty gang (x7)
Let's illuminate everything you stupid fakers
Are doing to the game you done came to defame
You blew to fame spewing lame crap
Way too inane to relay, rank than a sewer drain
You all do the same thing: squat, poo, and
"hey, I found lyrics!"
So I'ma call y'all the Booty Gang
Booty Gang-
Booty Gang?
Booty Gang
Booty Gang, who are they?
You don't want to know bro
Though you probably do already know whoa
I thought it was shoddy with everyone yelling "yolo"
Oh no, it was just fixing to get a lot worse
With some raw turds spitting shiznit that is not words
Awkwardly mumbling through what they call a verse
Y'all it hurts, just listening to it at all burns
It's easy to be a baller
When all you're doing's playing the same boring
Game over and freaking over again
And literally only ever saying the same four things
Which are
-I got money
-I got guns
-I bang honeys
-and do and/or sell drugs
And that's it... that’s all you have I’m saying
Go back, replay it, and say that I’m exaggerating
You can't cuz dangit I'm right and you know that I am
I'm over it and hoping that if nobody can
Show what a fantastical and exorbitant scam
You all are pulling on everybody then maybe I can
I'll lampoon every last one of you mumble rappers
Til Uncle Sam is ready to call it quits with all of this
Freaking nonsense that you all are dishing into his face
And until then I'ma call you kids Booty Gang
