[Verse 1: Skoolie 300]
(Let me tell you about this)
Lost girl that I knew from way back
Used to chill on the block where I used to stay at
Cutest and the coolest you would ever meet
But now she got new friends, we hardly speak
See, she be hanging with them on and off
But I can't tell her nothing, she's grown and lost
It's sad when I see her
Begging on the corner, so I pass when I see her
Don't care what she doing, don't ask when I see her
The love is gone
And she knows why 'cause the drugs are strong
And too strung out, needle to her arm
And I know her future, no need to read her palms
She a jump-off girl, no need for protection
Some use pipes and others use injections

[Hook: Skoolie 300]
Some use pipes, other use injections
She use them, she feels neglected
Tries to get clean, she gets rejected
Gets rejected, gets rejected
She's lost her heart, this hellish road
She's caught up in the town
She and that dope

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
If this was a game, I already know that I would come out winner
And I'm not bragging, I'ma be in her
But this bitch really think that I'm 'bout to buy her dinner
My steak good, I got a good cut like Splinter
Juicy and hot like a black bitch temper
Now she wanna talk and chop it up like a blender
But I don't give a fuck and or even listen like Schindler
She's cute, but her forehead big
Got stretch marks like she got four kids
Her legs can't close like a four door hinge Bronco
That O.J. killed the white whores with
My shit was good, the waitress bring the check
It was 38, I dropped 36
Her shit too
The least she could do was pay for her food or drop on the tip
Or she can start sucking dick
Like a Catholic virgin, the only dick she ever seen was her priest
Everything in the church is right
That's why the fucked up ones are on the East
Now she crying at me, looking at me like a geese
Bitching how she broke and she cannot pay for the feast
Bitch, you better go and wash dishes for the fee
Or the food 'cause the shit free, ain't, nope

[Hook: Skoolie 300]
Some use pipes, other use injections
She use them, she feels neglected
Tries to get clean, she gets rejected
Gets rejected, gets rejected
She's lost her heart, this hellish road
She's caught up in the town
She and that dope
