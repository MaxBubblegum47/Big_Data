[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Uh
Ayo, ayo
It's like 3 AM in Denmark
Watching movies and cartoons, heh

[Chorus: Yasiin Bey]
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit, movin' around, just movin' around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
My sister called the other day and said she loved me, wassup?
I called her back and said I'm sorry I don't say it enough
See I don't put up a front, I just say what I want, nigga
Never let a nigga tell me I couldn't stunt, uh
Pro black but this twink white (white)
I'll sign if the ink right (right)
Two cribs, I can sleep twice (twice)
Niggas swear they woke but got crust in their eyes
They can't blink right (woo!)
These niggas fake confidence and fake show how they feel
Then go home and big cry because that acne is real
Show them scars motherfucker
How you think they gon' heal up?
Scab ass niggas fucking up all the deals
I got niggas tryna slander me, I knew from the start
But I can't do it back to them, it ain't no hate in my heart
Y'all Stephen Hawkings with the way that y'all make moves
But I'ma flip the channel on you niggas
Just stay tuned and watch em
I'm the real Fresh Prince, new crib in Bel Air
And I feel so free, the cheetah print in my hair (woo!)
Rainbow on the belt, gang shit yeah yeah
I hopped out that bitch, had to make some room for my furs
Niggas picking out their victims, hot potato, hot potato
Tryna' cancel me on Twitter, but got limits on ya' data
Tell the engineer to turn me all the way up on the faders
Because everything I'm dropping hot as fuck like clumsy waiters

[Chorus: Yasiin Bey]
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit, movin' around, just movin' around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit, yeah, that's the king
