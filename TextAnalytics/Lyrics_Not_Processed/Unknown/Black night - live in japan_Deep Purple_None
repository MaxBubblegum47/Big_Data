Black night is not right
I don't feel so bright
I don't care to sit tight
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free, free to be me
Black night is a long way from home
I don't want a dark tree
I don't need a rough sea
I can't feel, I can't see
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free, free to be me
Black night is a long way from home
Black night, black night
I don't need black night
I can't see dark light
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free, free to be me
Black night is a long way from home
