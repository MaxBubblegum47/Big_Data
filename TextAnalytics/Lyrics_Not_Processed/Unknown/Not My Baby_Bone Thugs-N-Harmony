[Krayzie] Verse 1
I guess you blamed it on the wrong nigga, it ain't mine
I took the test and the results read it, you was lyin. (bitch you was lyin, lyin)
But you was cryin in my motherfuckin face
And all the while tellin niggas how you fin to get paid off Kray'
Thought you had a bone
Bitch got shit all wrong, a y'all know
I was suspicious from the front door, (front door)
Wasn't surprised when the ho took me to court and say she want do
Now the bitch has got the people in my business, (all in my business)
They come to find out, ain't even one of my children
You illin, playin with these kids man
You're dead wrong, got this baby callin me daddy
But daddy's a unsolved mystery
Cause appearently mommy ain't carin what she sleeps now

[Layzie] Verse 2
I shoulda knew your ass was drama
Round here tellin everybody yous my baby mama
Sayin I'm a buy you this and that like I'm your fuckin sponser
Look your honour, I ain't payin a dime
Because that young'n right there mine
I ain't lyin, I ain't no deadbeat daddy, with intent to be neglectin
All I wanted was some sex, but now she tryin to get a check
But baby hold on won't you wait a minute
The DNA a read negative, fuckin these chickens ain't no way to live
They tryin to get up in your pockets and break you down
For 18 years, so who rapin who now
Ninety-nine point nine percent not
I mean I ain't that baby father, I ain't gotta be bothered
With all that bullshit you stressin me with, testin my wits
I'm just about to slap in the clip, and do me a bitch
I'm through with this shit, I keep it real with my lady
Now you chickens that play me, don't knock that nigga little Layzie

[Child] Catch
Mo-mmy, hey mommy where's my da-ddy, where's my da-ddy?

I chip in, cause I'm chillin enough
Makin mill-i-ons, she wants some do, bitch NO!
Go get a J-O-B
Willin to help and I, help yourself for sho
I better play daddy
Comin out a woman in wich she never had me
Sadly, always in transition leavin gladly
Shit, I tried to be the papi
Nothin 'gainst the baby, momma can't make me happy
Fuck yeah I'm crazy, my father never knew about me
I was young, while another man mad at me
I got no real fam, maybe it's swellin straight
God I love you Lay', noone get in the way

[Wish] Verse 4
Why can't we pressure these broads, the way they pressure on us
That paper came and it read that nigga wasn't my son
Why can't we counter sue these bitches on the way they do us
Test one, test two, said I wasn't the one
So you can cancel that mo-ney!
Ri-din!, and flossin my mo-ney!
Oooh, I know you had a plan, lo-vely!
I hope the real baby daddy live his life, y-eah!
And you can tell your little girlfriend to stay out my face
I see you ain't told her the results of what you got in your case
You get's nada, what you ain't heard
I ain't the real baby's father, not a dollar
I guess the best is the best, somebody woulda got hurt
Cause I ain't payin for nothin, I got for free with no work
You so scandalous
Heard about my Benz, look they came and tried to relate us
Damn!
