When you walk past
That park near your apartment now
Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
Do you drive fast
When you realize you’re on my street?
Do you drive slowly?
Do you think about me?
Thought I could pack up my suitcase
And just walk away (walk away)
Leave you with all of the shit I didn’t want to take
My mistake
I’m missing you
I’m missing you
What the hell did I do — did I do?
Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to
Turns out I don’t want new-
I want you
I’m missing you
I’m missing you
What the hell did I do — did I do?
Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to
Turns out I don’t want new
I want you

[DROP]
Don’t want new, I want you
Don’t want new, I want you
I’m in his bed
Right next to him, but he don’t know
I’m just thinking ‘bout you
I’m thinking ‘bout you
When it’s 3am
And I’m at that diner with his friends
I ain't thinking ‘bout them
I’m just thinking ‘bout you
Thought I could pack up my suitcase
And just walk away (walk away)
Leave you with all of the shit I didn’t want to take
Want to take
I’m missing you
I’m missing you
What the hell did I do — did I do?
Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to
Turns out don’t want new
I want you
I’m missing you
I’m missing you
What the hell did I do — did I do?
Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to
Turns out don’t want new
I want you

[DROP]
Don’t want new, I want you
Don’t want new, I want you
Thought I’d be better without you
I can’t stop thinking about you
Now I’m with someone new
Thought I’d be better without you
I can’t stop thinking about you
Now I’m with someone new
I’m missing you
I’m missing you
What the hell did I do — did I do?
Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to
Turns out don’t want new
I want you
Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to
Turns out I don’t want new
I want you
