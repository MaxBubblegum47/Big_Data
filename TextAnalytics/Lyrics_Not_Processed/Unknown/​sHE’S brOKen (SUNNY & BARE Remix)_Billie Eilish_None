[Verse 1]
Another story of girl meets boy, and gets destroyed
Another promise broken in two, the lucky view of fiction

[Pre-Chorus]
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story of girl meets boy

[Drop]
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it

[Verse 2]
So picture perfect, it can't be real and all you feel is numb
You see them talking but hear no sound to hit the ground
And fade

[Chorus]
Another story
Another story of girl meets boy

[Drop]
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it
He's okay, she's broken
He's the ocean waves, she's chokin'
