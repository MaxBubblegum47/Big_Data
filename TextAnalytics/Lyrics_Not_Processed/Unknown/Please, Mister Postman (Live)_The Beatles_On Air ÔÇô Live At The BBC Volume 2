[Intro]
(Wait) Oh yes, wait a minute‚ Mr. Postman
(Wait) Wai-hey-hey-hey-it‚ Mr. Postman

[Chorus]
(Please‚ Mr. Postman, look and see) Whoa yeah
(Is there a letter in your bag for me?) Please, please‚ Mr. Po-oh-ostman
('Cause it's been a mighty long time) Whoa yeah
(Since I heard from this boyfriend of mine)

[Verse 1]
There must be some word today
From my boyfriend so far away
Please, Mr. Postman, look and see
Is there a letter‚ a letter for me?
I've been standin' here waitin', Mr. Postman
So so patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Sayin' he's returnin' home to me

[Chorus]
Please, Mr. Postman
(Please, Mr. Postman, look and see) Whoa yeah
(Is there a letter in your bag for me?) Please, please, Mr. Po-oh-oh-ostman
('Cause it's been a mighty long time) Whoa yeah
(Since I heard from this boyfriend of mine)

[Verse 2]
So many days, you've passed me by
You saw the tears standin' in my eye
You wouldn't stop to make me feel better
By leavin' me a card or a letter

Please, Mr. Postman, look and see
Is there a letter, oh yeah, in your bag for me?
You know it's been so long
Yeah, since I heard from this boyfriend of mine

[Outro]
You better wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Whoa, you better wait a minute
Please, please, Mr. Postman (Wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Please check and see
Just one more time for me

You gotta wait a minute (wait), wait a minute (Wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Oh you better wait a minute, wait a minute
Please, Mr. Po-ostman (Wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Don't pass me by, you see the tears in my eyes

You better wait (Wait)
Wait a minute (Wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Please Mr. Postman
