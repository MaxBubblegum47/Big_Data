[Verse 1]
Greasy slicked down
Groovy leather trim
I like the way you hold the road
Mama, it ain't no sin

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 2]
Ooh, trouble-free transmission
Helps your oils flow
Mama, let me pump your gas
Mama, let me do it all

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 3]
Check that heavy metal
Underneath your hood
Baby, I can work all night
Believe I got the perfect tools

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 4]
Automobile with comfort
Really built with style
Specialist tradition
Mama, let me feast my eyes

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 5]
Factory air-conditioned
Heat begins to rise
Guaranteed to run for hours
Mama, you're the perfect size

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 6]
Grooving on the freeway
Gauges all are red
Gun down on my gasoline
Believe I'm gonna crack your head

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout...

[Bridge]
I can't stop talking about
I can't stop talking about
Ooh, yeah, yes
Drive on
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes
I'm coming through

[Verse 7]
Come to me for service
Every hundred miles
Baby, let me check your points
Fix your overdrive

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 8]
Ooh yeah, fully automatic
Comes in any size
Makes me wonder what I did
Before we synchronized

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 9]
Oooh, feather-light suspension
Konis couldn't hold
I'm so glad I took a look
Inside your showroom doors

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
Oh, I can't
Oh, I can't

[Outro]
Oh, I can't stop talking about love
I can't stop talking about love
Ooh, let me go on down, go on down
Go on down, go on down, go on down, yeah

I can't stop talking about
I can't stop talking about love, oh yeah
I can't stop talking about love or my baby
I can't stop talking about love, my baby
My baby, my baby, yeah

Push, push
Push it
Push, push
Oooooooohhh
