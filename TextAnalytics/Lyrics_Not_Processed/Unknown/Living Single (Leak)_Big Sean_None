[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh, yeah, look

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some xxx girls
Pussy get wet as an s-curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like, "I got some hoes, hit me back," fuck it

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could
Let you down
I don't know why
You keep my mind
Racing again
You kiss my lips
When you trip
I'll take you anywhere
I'll take you

[Post-Chorus: Jeremih]
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kinda world
I'm glad I got my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kinda world
I'm glad I got my girl

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby, we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Yeah, oh I could
Let you down
I don't know why
You keep my mind
Racing again
You kiss my lips
When you trip
I'll take you anywhere
I'll take you

[Post-Chorus: Jeremih & Chance the Rapper]
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kinda world
I'm glad I got my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kinda world
I'm glad I got my girl

[Verse 3: Smino]
Pink caddy, Pepto-Bismobile
Ting named Cali, that ass on sunset hill
A beautiful view, unusual, I'm hooked on the real
And you would be too, I'm pookie bout that coochie, for real
Okay cool, I guess I love the way you
Nourish the soul, you know that ass look like a fuckin' grapefruit
Hitting them push-ups so when I'm up in that what's up, what's up you get whooped up
Arch that thing like where I'm from,
 
been on my brain, miss serotonin
Living la vida with my Lavita, feel like Ceddy
Liberate your limbs eliminate your limits, let me
You feel just like lemonade on ice when I'm all sweaty
She said, "Smino, boy I get it all ready"

[Post-Chorus: Jeremih]
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl
