[Chorus]
Oh, I remember you-ooh
I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue-ooh

[Verse 2]
When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh

[Chorus]
I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue-ooh

[Verse 3]
When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh

[Chorus]
I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
Like the rain out of the blue-ooh

[Verse 4]
When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them I remember
Tell them I remember
Tell them I remember you
