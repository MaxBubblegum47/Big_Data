[Verse 1]
It hurts so bad to watch you leave
We packed your stuff, and I set you free
Baby don't turn around
You don't want to see another tear fall down
Just keep heading towards anything that ain't me
We laid our hearts out on the table
Mine wants you to stay, yours isn't able

[Chorus]
I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me

[Post-Chorus]
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me

[Verse 2]
Every time I close my eyes, I see your face behind those headlights
Pulling back into that driveway
Hearing everything I wanna hear you say
Like, "I love you", "I need you", "I missed you"

[Chorus]
I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me

[Post-Chorus]
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me

[Bridge]
Yeah, back to me, back to these arms of mine
Patiently waiting for you
This door is always gonna be open for you
Back to me, back to us

[Chorus]
Yeah, I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me

[Post-Chorus]
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me

[Chorus]
I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me

[Post-Chorus]
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
