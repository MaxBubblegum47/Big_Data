Maybe it's because I'm only started that I think it won't take too long
Maybe it's because I can see you laughing that I think you've got it wrong
Maybe I could be like Robin Hood, like and outlaw dressed all in green
Someone said "What's he gonna turn out like?" Ha!
And someone else said "Never mind!"
Well I was big and bold and more than twice as old as all the cats I'd ever seen
I grew my hair and bought a suit of shiny white (or was it cream)
I shook and shivered and danced and quivered and stood on a mountain top, woah
No one came from miles around and said "Man, your music is really hot!"
Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak ah my throat was tired and worn
My pretty face just looked out of place as they poured on the scorn
I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king
He said "My boy, we'll have some crazy scenes!"
There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about
Yeah he must've been the king of queens
Well I could write a million songs about the things I've done
But I could never sing them so they'd never get sung
There's a law for the rich and one for the poor
And there's another one for singers, it's 'Die young and live much longer'
And 'Spend your money and sit and wonder'
No one came for miles around and said "Man, your music is really funky!"
Well I believe that I must tell the truth and say things as they really are
But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth, could I ever be a star?
Nobody knows who's real and who's faking, everyone's shouting out loud
It's only the glitter and shine that gets through
Where's my Robin Hood outfit?
Well I've come and I've gone before you wink an eye
No one even cared enough to say goodbye
The money's good and the times you have, fun and games galore
But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten
And you wonder what you did it for
No one came from miles around and said "Man, who's he?" Ha!
