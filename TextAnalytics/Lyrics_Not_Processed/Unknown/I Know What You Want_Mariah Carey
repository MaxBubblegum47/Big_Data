[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, Shorty, I know what you need
I got everything you need
I promise I ain't gon' hold out neither
I'ma give it all to you, baby
It's burnin' on, bust it

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & 
Mariah Carey
]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

[Verse 1: Spliff Star]
We been together for a few years, shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road, hardly ever home
Always busy this, busy that, can't talk on the phone
I know you aggravated, walk around frustrated
Patience gettin' short, how longer can you tolerate it?
Listen, Ma, I'm just motivated
I do this for us, stuck on the grind, tryin' to elevate it now

[Verse 2: Baby Sham]
Ayo, to really be honest you stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express through words how much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man, never above ya
Well, I could tell that you different from most, slightly approach you
And the ill shit about it? We don't sex every day
But when we sex, we tease in a passionate way
I love the way you touch it, those little elaborate ways
Got the god feelin' released to relax for the day
It's on you, Ma

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & 
Mariah Carey
]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Shh, Mami listen
I feel your love for me, baby, and how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment to talk the truth to you (Listen)
I'm never home, I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigmarole
I never meant to put a thousand pounds of stress on your head
I love the way we sleep and how we always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' your patience, sheddin' your tears with me
I ask you, my mami, please continue to bear with me

[Verse 4: Rah Digga & 
Mariah Carey
]
We started out broke, constantly on the roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from loosies and buses, and fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed, still got each other back (
Yeah, yeah
)
Word is bond, never screwed none of these industry cats, boy
We like Scull and Mulder
, walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game, watchin' our seeds gettin' older (Yeah)

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & 
Mariah Carey
]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you (
I'll give it to you
)
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it (
Gonna give it to you, boy
)
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes & 
Mariah Carey
]
Yes, you know I'll die for you (Uh)
And you know I'll ride wit' you (Come on)
I will always try wit' you (Uh)
And give you my love and cry wit' you (Let's go)
I will climb a mountain high
 (Uh-huh)
Until our love will touch the sky
 (Uh)
So baby come and get more close to me
 (Mariah)
'Cause this is where your love is supposed to be, baby
 (Tell 'em)

[Verse 5: Rampage]
I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA, you haven't seen me
You lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats, your ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world, you never leave me
Fall back, Ma, I'll make your lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things you do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter, you'll never do me greasy

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & 
Mariah Carey
]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

[Outro: Busta Rhymes &
