[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & 
DRAM
]
Pour the soda in the Wockhardt
Paint the picture like pop art
Boy, you sweeter than Pop-Tart
Say I'm pretty like Leon
Her chest beatin' like five hearts
Popcorn and the Klondike
Carhartt where my car apart
Just come and get me when it's my part
Gave the Uber-man five stars
Left the restaurant, five stars
I was fuckin' with a five star
She done fucked about five stars, sidebar
Pull off, all the kids fightin' like, "That's my car"
Calvin and Raf (Calvin and Raf)
Now out of stock (now out of stock)
They don't know Flacko, grippin' the wop (Flacko)
I do what I want (do what I want, want)
I'm sippin' the Wock (
Yeah
)
I'm showin' my teeth off
Two thousand in rocks

[Chorus: DRAM & 
A$AP Rocky
]
My nigga says he got the Wock for 40 a line (a line)
If I sip a deuce, it get me through every time (every time)
I pull up and walk
Sippin' the Wock
I pull up in what?
Sippin' the Wock

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
New Prada bag (new Prada bag)
Brown butterscotch (brown butterscotch)
They don't know Flacko (they don't know Flacko)
I'm grippin' the wop (woo, I'm grippin' the wop)
I do what I want (do, do, do what I want)
I'm sippin' the Wock (Wock)
I modeled for Dior
Gucci down to the socks (down to the socks)
Bitches gon' fuck
Womens gon' flock
Throwin' me box
Givin' me top
You must've forgot
This nigga's colossal
My bitch is a model
Gettin' the guap, gettin' the guap
Do what I want (uh, uh, do what I want)
Sippin' a lot (lot, lot)
I've been trippin' a lot (lot, lot)
Got a script from the doc (script from the doc)
I just fibbed to the cops (fibbed to the cops)
I don't talk to the 12 (talk to the 12)
I don't snitch to the cops (snitch to the cops)
I forget shit a lot, word

[Chorus: DRAM & 
A$AP Rocky
]
My nigga says he got the Wock for 40 a line (a line)
If I sip a deuce, it get me through every time (every time)
I pull up and walk
Sippin' the Wock
I pull up in what?
Sippin' the Wock

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I used to sip Actavis
They manufactured it
Sippin' these medicines 

[
TESTING!
]
Got lean in my mattresses
I pull up and walk
Sippin' the Wock
I pull up in what?
Sippin' the Wock
