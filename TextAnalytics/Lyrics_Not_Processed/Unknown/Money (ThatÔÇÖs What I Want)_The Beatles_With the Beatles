[Verse 1]
The best things in life are free
But you can keep 'em for the birds and bees

[Chorus]
Now, give me money (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want, yeah (That's what I want)
That's what I want

[Verse 2]
Your lovin' gives me a thrill
But your lovin' don't pay my bills

[Chorus]
Now, give me money (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want, oh yeah (That's what I want)
That's what I want

[Verse 3]
Money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use

[Chorus]
Now, give me money (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want, yeah (That's what I want)
That's what I want, whoa

[Verse 3]
Money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use

[Chorus]
Now, give me money (That's what I want)
That's what I want (That's what I want)
That's what I want, yeah (That's what I want)
That's what I want

[Outro]
Well, now, give me money (That's what I want)
Whole lot of money (That's what I want)
Wow, yeah, I wanna be free (That's what I want)
Oh, a lot of money (That's what I want)
That's what I want, yeah (That's what I want)
That's what I want
Well, now, give me money (That's what I want)
Whole lot of money (That's what I want)
Wow, yeah, you know I need money (That's what I want)
Oh, now, give me money (That's what I want)
That's what I want, yeah (That's what I want)
That's what I want
