[Intro]
You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care

[Verse]
Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell? Whoa oh, oh
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, ooh

[Verse]
Listen (Do da do)
Do you want to know a secret? (Do da do)
Do you promise not to tell? (Do da do) Whoa oh, oh
Closer (Do da do)
Let me whisper in your ear (Do da do)
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, ooh

[Bridge]
I've known the secret for a week or two
Nobody knows, just we two

[Verse]
Listen (Do da do)
Do you want to know a secret? (Do da do)
Do you promise not to tell? (Do da do) Whoa oh, oh
Closer (Do da do)
Let me whisper in your ear (Do da do)
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, ooh
Ooh
