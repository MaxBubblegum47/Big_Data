[Intro]
Doin' what I gotta do, doin’ what I gotta do
This life is not for you
Uhh, woah woah woah woah

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
That's just the ways, yeah
I swear that's just the ways
I can’t change how I was raised
You know that's just the ways
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I overthink too much, that's just how I was raised
I'm dealin' with choices that no one around me ever had to make
The result of going down the road less paved without ways
That’s just the ways, that’s just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah yeah
Dad cheated on Mom, that’s how I was raised
So how do you expect me to have different ways?
Broken marriages somehow get inherited
I'm embarrassed to say, but that's just the ways, that's just the ways, yeah
So how do you expect me to be financial
And manage the money that everyone ’round me can't handle?
How do you expect me to be a leader
If I never seen one?

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Cause that's just the ways, yeah yeah
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways
I can't change how I was raised
Blowing weed, yellin' "Fuck the police" every other day
Seen fiends to crack every day, that's just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah yeah
Cause that's just the ways
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways

[Verse 2]
At least I thought so until I got it from a different angle
Back when the closest thing to Arizona was the much mucho mangos
I was drained, though
Going through life no strings attached, still gettin' tangled
Before I knew I was the one that realized the strings was handled by angles
Thinkin' I don't wanna have a kid in this world and it might go to waste
Having a son with a gun on his waist
Falling victim to the system that we can't escape
Stuck in the city like a never ending maze
Treating problems like they ain't problems and they a phase

[?] raise cause he can't take advice I never gave, yeah yeah
Cause if Dad treated Mom with a little respect, yeah
Then he gon' grow up and find the right girl to protect
Cause family businesses ands good marriages somehow get inherited
When life give you that message, it's up to you to translate, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Cause that's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways
I realize I can't change how I was raised
And give somebody something they never gave
Cause that's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah
That's just the ways
I ain't gotta be stuck in my ways
That's just the ways, yeah yeah
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways

[Outro: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Way, way
It's like this for you
Way, way
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah, yeah (ways)
Oh ah
Oh ah
That's just the ways, that's just the ways
That's just the ways, yeah, yeah
