[Verse 1]
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

[Verse 2]
Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

[Bridge]
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more—misery

[Chorus]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

[Verse 3]
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

[Chorus]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

[Bridge]
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more—misery

[Outro]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
You
You
