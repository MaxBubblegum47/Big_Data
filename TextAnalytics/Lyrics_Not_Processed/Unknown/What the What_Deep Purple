We goin' out tomorrow, gonna do it right
Celebrate the fact that we're still alive
In that case, we better make it tonight
I'll drink for us all and you can drive

My mojo working and I paid my dues
I'm gonna break out my dancing shoes
I'm gonna do what I do best
I'm gonna spend my money till there's nothing left

So bad, I been so bad, I been so bad
What the what happened to you last night?

Every bar in London had an old joanna
And cats who could play rock and roll piano
No-one cared a few teeth gone missing
Everybody got up to sing

Five string guitars, and old skin drums
On a river boat shuffle, bunch a-drunken bums
No way of knowing when the temperature dropped
The moment was hot, there was no time to stop

So bad, we were so bad, we been so bad
What the what happened to you last night?

Long tall Sally and short fat Dave
Arms and legs going every-ways
They didn't care about shape or size
The fever of love was in their eyes

Called every bad name under the sun
They did the same to us, we was just having fun
He went up and she went down
It didn't really matter, they just went to town

So bad, they were so bad, they been so bad
What the what happened to you last night?

I was so bad, I been so bad, I been so bad
What the what happened to you last night?
