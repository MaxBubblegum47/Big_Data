If the sun should tumble from the sky
If the sea should suddenly run dry
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen I won't care
If a dream I fear should fall apart
I can still be smiling with my heart
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen darling I won't care
Shall I catch a shooting star
Shall I bring it where you are
If you only say you care
I can make a mountain fall
I'll do anything at all
As long as you are there
When at last my life on earth is through
I will share eternity with you
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen darling I won't care

Let it happen darling I won't care
