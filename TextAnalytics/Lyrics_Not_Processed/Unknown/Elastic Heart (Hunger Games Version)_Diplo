[Intro: Sia]
I won't give up, I won't give up
I won't give up, I won't give up

[Verse 1: Sia]
And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

[Chorus: Sia]
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

[Post-Chorus: Sia]
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

[Pre-Chorus: Sia & The Weeknd]
You did not break me (You did not break me, no, no)
I'm still fighting for peace

[Chorus: Sia]
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
