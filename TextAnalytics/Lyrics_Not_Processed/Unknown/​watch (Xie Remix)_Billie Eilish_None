[Verse 1]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back

[Verse 2]
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Outro]
I'll sit and watch your car
Watch your car
Never let you
Watch your car, watch your car
Burn
Watch your car, watch your car
Never let you
Burn
I'll sit and watch your car
Watch your car
Watch your car, watch your car
Watch your car, watch your car
Watch your car, watch your car
