[Intro: Paul McCartney]
Yes, I'll take one, please

[?]
A tune called, "Red Sails in the Sunset"
The one you've come for

[...]
"Red Sails in the Sunset"

[Verse 1]
Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me
She sailed at the dawning, all day I've been blue
Red sails in the sunset, I'm trusting in you

[Verse 2]
Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one home, yeah, safely to me
Ow!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Swift wings you must borrow
Make straight for the shore
Well, we marry tomorrow
And she goes sailing no more

[Verse 3]
Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Swift wings you must borrow
Make straight for the shore
Well, we marry tomorrow
And she goes sailing away no more

[Verse 4]
Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea
Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me

[Outro]
Yeah, home safely to me
(Indecipherable)
