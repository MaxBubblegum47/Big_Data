[Intro: DripReport]
For the rest of us
For the rest of us

[Verse: DripReport]
Okay, she keep calling, she keep calling every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh, no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross me-
Said I want to die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot (yuh), I'm so fucking tired (yuh)
So, what you say?
Feeling good, I'm feeling great
Tired of the fucking hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate
