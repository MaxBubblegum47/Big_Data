[Verse 1]
You're lazy, you stay in bed
You're lazy, you stay in bed
You don't want no money, you don't want no bread, no, no
If you're drowning, clutch no straw
If you're drowning, you clutch no straw
Wanna cry, don't wanna live no more, no, no

[Verse 2]
No more round my door
No boo-hooing, [?]
Wanna be steppin' in the puddles, no more

[Chorus]
Lazy
Stay in bed
Lazy
Come on honey
Come on honey
