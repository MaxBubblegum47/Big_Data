[Intro]
Try it if it feels right (try it)
Try it if it feels right, yeah
When you try, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Jorja Smith]
I'm tryin'—I'm just, yeah, I'm just, yeah
I been out here tryin' to see my homecomin'
And of course, somebody's always gonna say somethin'
Try and shoot me down for voicin' my own opinion
Triggerin' a part of me that's always been indifferent

[Pre-Chorus: Jorja Smith]
And I know that we have asked for change
Don't be scared to put the fears to shame

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free

[Verse 2: Jorja Smith]
Open up this letter you ain't tryin' to read
You've been blind to the subject, but not blind to me
And I know that this margin ain't too small for me
Not too real, not too much anymore, not enough

[Pre-Chorus: Jorja Smith]
And I know that we have asked for change
Don't be scared to put the fears to shame

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like dependin' on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free

[Outro: Jorja Smith & Kendrick Lamar]
If who I am offends you, don't feel sorry
Don't feel, don't feel sorry, don't feel, don't feel sorry
My loss is worth more than your wins
I'm satisfied if it starts over again
That is everything, that is everything
That is everything, that is everything
That is everything—
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I, stop, I am what you not
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
I, stop, I am what you not
I try to make it stop, I pray it will stop
