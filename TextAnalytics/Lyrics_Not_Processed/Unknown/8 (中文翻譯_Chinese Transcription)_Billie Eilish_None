[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, let me finish
等等，請讓我說完
I know you don't care
我知道你並不在意
But can you listen?
但是你能聽聽嗎
I came committed, guess I overdid it
我必須承認，猜我有點過頭了
Wore my heart out on a chain
曾吧我的心穿在項鍊上
Around my neck, but now it's missing, hmm
繞著我的脖子，現在卻已經丟失了，hmm

[Refrain 1]
Da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Chorus 1]
So I think I better go
所以我想我最好離開
I never really know how to please you
我從來不知道如何取悅你
You're looking at me like I'm see-through
你看我的眼神彷彿我一眼便能被看穿
I guess I'm gonna go
我想我要離開了
I just never know how you feel
我從來都不明白你的感受
Do you even feel anything?
你對我有過感受嗎？

[Refrain 2]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
你說，"不要待我如此惡劣"
But you said it so sadly
但你卻說的如此悲傷
So I did the best I could
所以我傾盡我的全部
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
開心的以為你不會離開我
I know you're not sorry
我知道你不感到抱歉
Why should you be?
你怎麼會呢？
'Cause who am I to be in love
因為誰才是墮入愛河的人
When your love never is for me?
當你的愛從來都不屬於我？
Me
我

[Refrain 3]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
Oh, hmm, hmm

[Chorus 2]
So I think I better go
所以我想我最好離開
I never really know how to please you
我從來不知道如何取悅你
You're looking at me like I'm see-through
你看我的眼神彷彿我一眼便能被看穿
I guess I'm gonna go
我想我要離開了
I just never know how you feel
我從來都不明白你的感受
Do you even feel anything?
