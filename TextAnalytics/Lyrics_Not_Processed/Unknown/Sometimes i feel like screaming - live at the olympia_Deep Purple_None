While you were out... the message says
You left a number and I tried to call
But they wrote it down in a perfect Spanish scrawl
A perfect Spanish scrawl
Yet again, I'm missing you
King size bed in a hotel someplace
I hear your name; I see your face
I see your face
The backstreet dolls and the side door johnnies
And the wide eyed boys with their bags full of money
Back in the alley, going bang to the wall
Tied to the tail of a midnight crawl
Heaven wouldn't be so high I know
If the times gone by hadn't been so low
The best laid plans come apart at the seams
And shatter all my dreams
Sometimes I feel like screaming
Close my eyes
It's times like this my head goes down
And the only thing I know is the name of this town
The name of this town
Yet again, I'm missing you
Won't be long, I'm coming home
Until that distant time, I'll be moving on
I'll be moving on
The backstreet dolls and the side door johnnies
And the wide eyed boys with their bags full of money
Back in the alley, going bang to the wall
Tied to the tail of a midnight crawl
Heaven wouldn't be so high I know
If the times gone by hadn't been so low
The best laid plans come apart at the seams
And shatter all my dreams
It's all in the mind
It's all in the mind
It's all in the mind
It's all in the mind
The backstreet dolls and the side door johnnies
And the wide eyed boys with their bags full of money
Back in the alley, going bang to the wall
Tied to the tail of a midnight crawl
Heaven wouldn't be so high I know
If the times gone by hadn't been so low
The best laid plans come apart at the seams
And shatter all my dreams
