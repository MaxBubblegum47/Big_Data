[Verse 1]
Walks in the rain, talks in the dark
Old black and white movies, a day at the park
On a blanket on the ground on a Sunday afternoon
Hanging with friends or off by ourselves
Driving around yard sale to yard sale
Dropping by the county fair, winning you a bear popping balloons

[Chorus]
If you're looking for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
It you're looking for that man, here I am

[Verse 2]
December nights all cuddled up
Warmed by the fire and sharing a cup
Of hot cocoa laughing at old photos
Spanish guitars, sand and the sea
A quiet little table just you and me
Sipping margaritas in a little cantina in Old Mexico

[Chorus]
If you're looking for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
It you're looking for that man, here I am

[Bridge]
Talking 'bout life and talking about babies
Talking bout us still in love when we're eighty

[Chorus]
If you're looking for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
It you're looking for that man, here I am

[Outro]
Here I am
Baby, here I am
