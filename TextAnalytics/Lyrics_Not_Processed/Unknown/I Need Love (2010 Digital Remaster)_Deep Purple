I keep singing the same old song
Like I did before
When you left me baby, you left me in darkness
I'd never known before
I was restless, a fool for your time
Waiting 'round for you to call me, baby
But now I've found me an angel of mercy
I don't feel bad at all
Your body was honey, I tasted a lot
But let me tell you babe, I need more than you got
I want someone to hold me
I need love, I need love
I've got nothing to do, baby, nothing to say
Just live your life the way you know
When you moved on you took all the sweetness
Was I a fool to let you go?
Now with a woman I forget for the moment
All the times we knew before
Though I'm still singing the same old love song
I don't want you knocking on my door
Your body was honey, I tasted a lot
But let me tell you babe, I need more than you got
I want someone to hold me and keep me satisfied
I need
I want someone to hold me, keep me satisfied
Your body was honey, I tasted a lot
But let me tell you babe, I need more than you got
I want someone to hold me
I need love, hey baby, I need love babe
I need love, you could give it to me
I need your love, I need your love
Love, your love, oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, want to know
Keep on lovin' me, keep on love
Keep on lovin' me baby, babe
Keep on lovin' me
Keep on lovin' me, babe
