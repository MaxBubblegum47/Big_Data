[Verse 1]
Straight up
Look
The album droppin', they gettin' nervous
I cancel my Uber, it's time to lift the burden
Know if I take a pay cut that you gon' need a surgeon
I don't want the top spot, I deserve it
All I do is show love and it keep reversin'
Detroit, stand up, you know I'mma lead the resurgence
And prove so much my old shit sound like another person
You know how the story go
Never stuck to the script or storyboard
I just left a four o'clock appointment with the oracle
She told me I got more to go, her boss workin' like I'm fresh off the unemployment though
And I'm celebrating like they told me "You are not the father" live on the Maury Show
It ain't over till a nigga overdose
I heard your new shit and I fell asleep
And wasn't even sleepy, that's how I know it was weak
Look, respect someone who came from the D
Was able to eat, put his friends and fam on and we speak
Who inferred that anyone who skin color this deep
Who still hasn't peaked
Who gets better every verse and word that he speak
Sheesh
Flex let's go
Settin' the tone?
Yeah, we settin' the tone
You lettin' them know what it is?
Yes, sir
I Decided tonight
Look

[Verse 2]
I know 'Ye proud of me, he took me out of debt
I know Jay proud of me, he put this 'round my neck
And I might just kill ISIS with the same ice pick that I murder Donald Trump in the same night with
Lyrically I'm prepared for the worst
Spiritually I'm prepared for the best
But somehow I ended up in the middle
The exact place where me and destiny met
And I'm still findin' perfection in the imperfections
Tryna go the right way in life's intersection
You're now fuckin' with the most impressive
The most requested, you're witnessing the underdog's interception
And fourth quarter when you thought it was all over
I'm doin' the touchdown dance breakin' they hearts and records
And I probably wrote this shit down there in Austin, Texas
Livin' a life that'll turn my girl to a detective
I'm livin' a life that'll turn my dogs to some executives
I'm livin' a life that'll turn my dreams to some perspectives
Speaking of dreams, I got new dreams and new goals
My new vision is two-oh, by two-oh, that's 2020
Just tryna get that old money, young and find a loophole
[?] and my dogs in a conference call that can use those
So we don't gotta look back like we missed that boat
I got old niggas dissing, ex-girls missin'
Tell me, when did life become a game of tic-tac-toe?
I'm celebrating everyday like I got misdiagnosed
With terminal cancer, but it was just that cold
Oh, shit

[Verse 3]
I keep it anchored for you, rain, sleet or thunderstorm
Loyalty nowadays rare as a unicorn
I dedicate this one to stories that never get told
Ones who been offered the world for they souls but never get sold
Those are million dollar offers but chose another road
'Cause you realize stayin' loyal to you is always worth more
If the sky falls, you know I pick it back up [?]
In tune with the universe, like it's angels singing backup, man
Niggas ask me what's my backup plan
I look at 'em and say, "Does God have a backup plan?"
I'm sayin', look, I ain't God but I'm godlike
God don't like ugly, so I must one of the ones God like
'Cause I been at the right place at the wrong time
With the wrong people at the right place but still ended up here on time
Still ended up on time
Look, I guess it's hard not to get spotted when you livin' in the spotlight
I got my clique poppin', but I hardly live that pop life
Mighta popped a popstar, had paparazzi pop lights
But don't get it twisted, I'm in L.A. livin' that Pac life
In New York livin' that Big life
I'm in Detroit livin' that Don life
I left my last bitch and got my mom right
And I'm still carvin', killin' niggas, dearly departed
Workin' the game like a nigga blew in the cartridge
They know my name in Denver like I'm Eric Cartman
I put granny in the crib like I'm her father
All my neighbors went to Yale and Harvard
Captain of the squad forever startin'
Check the highlights, no yellow markers
I'm deadly switchin' Rollies onto ice like I'm cooking Crystal Light
My role model Walter White, my role model Walter White
Man fuck gettin' indicted, boy, riots gettin' incited
Black boy from that black [?], I'm just tryna bring light in
Young hero in my city: Teen Titan
The team the tightest, I touch her and she wet beside it
When I get inside it
But honestly, I can't get even too involved
Phone full of numbers, but ain't too many to call
Contacts on contacts, I hate we lost contact
I know I got more exes than a contract
But I wish it was you and me, remember when you were roofin' me
I wish there was one me for you, one for my family, I mean a group of me's
Goddamn, had to take a breather
Shit, can you believe it
Hold up, I ain't done my nigga
Need another?
No, hold up

Ha ha ha, yeah of course we here
Where else would we be at?
Okay, let's go

[Verse 4]
Okay
Shout out my nigga Esco
Yeah
Look, real ones
Look, all I ever did was figure it out
Back when a nigga used to have to live on the couch
And had to brainstorm this shit just to get through the drought
I strategized it in my head and started livin' it out
Man, these niggas want to purse what I do on the work
Drag my name through the mud without doing the dirt
I put your face on the shirt like I'm doin' your merch
You love to talk, I'm 'bout doin' it first
Look, I see no change, you can keep the refund
And all the reruns, I seen it all before
Man, I haven't been satisfied in a row
That's one time, two times, three times
From where there's more pieces than piece signs
And gang signs and street signs
Hard times, but you pay your fee to be a phenom
I pull up in a car so busted that I'm hidin' in it
Don't want that Kia even if LeBron is ridin' in it
Psh, I'm offended
Knowing soon as he leave that commercial he pullin' off in that Bentley
Feelin' like the ninth inning, got a home run hittin'
Stone cold spit it, I'm too in tune to be inconsistent
And I done been through the ups and downs
And stay down and waited for ups to come around
You woulda thought we robbed a bank how I'm tryna run the town
And how cops hunt us down as our time runnin' out
I pray that karma doesn't get confused with
Somebody who didn't put the hours and work in and who's useless
'Cause I'm God's MC, like Jesus produced it
It's time to make it work and not make excuses
What are you sayin', my man?
Askin' me about my own
What you tryna do what I do, boy, what, you want be my clone?
You ain't been through what I been through, you can't put that in songs
What you tryna prove me wrong like the banks that put mom on loans
You better watch up your tone, like you talk on the phone
I'm a [?] like I'm sittin' on drones
Damn, look
I'm tryna take the greatest story never told and make it my own

[Outro]
Flex
I Decided out right now in this motherfucker
Man, I ain't slept in two-three days
I'm on beast mode
Whatever niggas say about me, fuck what you sayin' if it ain't love
All I do is live my life and love, show love
That's what you supposed to do
That's the way that Jesus do it
If you hatin' on me, fuck you
You know what I'm sayin'?
Flex in the buildin'
G.O.O.D. Music all day
Detroit all day
You see the chains?
