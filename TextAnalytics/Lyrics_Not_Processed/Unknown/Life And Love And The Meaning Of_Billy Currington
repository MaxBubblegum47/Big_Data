Well I never thought that I'd be where I'm at
At this point in my life looking back
My old heart's been broken more than I can count
And my plans aren't going like I've worked 'em out

[Chorus]

Laying around and contemplate, life and love and the meaning of

[Verse 2]
Well I posed my questions and got no reply
Maybe God's just saying why ask why
And I think how boring this old life would be if we had the answers to everything

Laying around and contemplate, life and love and the meaning of

Another day is coming I should be on to something really good by then

[Chorus]
I think I just might spend the day looking up at the clouds above
Laying around and contemplate, life and love and the meaning of
I think I just might spend the day looking up at the clouds above
Laying around and contemplate, life and love and the meaning of
