[Intro]
Actual people that like, liked me in here, I don't know why. Like, I don't know why. I don't know. So, I hope you know it makes me very happy to—ooh—it makes me very happy to hear—see that you guys are here. I love all your faces. You look very pretty, you look very cute. Alright, alright, okay, here we go. We're really going for real, okay

[Chorus]
Mmm, all the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
I can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight, mm
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
Sing it, woo (All the good girls go to Hell)
'Cause even God herself, mm, has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team, mm

[Post-Chorus]
And my Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
And my god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now
