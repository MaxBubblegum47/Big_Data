[Layzie Bone]
Wicked Wonka, baby

[Violent J]
Halloween! Hallowicked Wonka....just 18 months

[Violent J]
I brought a bat to a mosh-pit (Well what you do then??)
I split some craniums in half
And caved a few in
Before long I'm standing there alone
I shut the party down
For Bone Thugs, Tech N9ne, Kottonmouth and Esham

[Layzie Bone]
In...coming, I'm running and dropping them bombs
Still gunning, I'm willing and ready for war
Get down with the clowns from ICP, B-O-N-E
And the Kottonmouth Kings, bring it how we bring it doe
For the wicked wonka, Halloween

[Violent J]
Smoking hay, hey I'm Violent J hey, we screaming may-day
Cause Bone and ICP a fucking pay-day
We give away hey
But we already millionare rapper
Hater slappers, wicked shit believe it though
We tight like alligator snappers

[Layzie Bone]
Don't run dawg, we gun clappers
Bitch nigga slappers and ho mackers
City street slicked rappers
But better known as wig crackers
Lead packers, ask my nigga Tech N9ne
Cock it back for Esham
And let it loose to they spine

[Bridge: Judge D, Shaggy 2 Dope]
An we mashing, we stomping
We wicked wicked wonkin'
[It's wicked when you walking
Within the thug pit)
Yeah we mashing, we stomping
We wicked wicked wonkin'
[At this kind of mosh pit you get your wig split)

[D-Loc]
Who the motherfucker in the pit talking shit? (Shit!)
Who the motherfucker that want the wig split? (Split!)
Who the motherfucker that's down for the krown? (Krown!)
Who the motherfucker in here right now?

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Shaggy jumps in the pit
With these hatchets and swingin' them
Strictly for the purpose of splitting some craniums
Shit, we be illuminati at this thug pit though
Treating fake thugs like a ho, tell 'em D-Loc (Spit!)

[D-Loc]
What the fuck you thinking, you can stop my shine?
Put your money where your mouth is, I'll take every dime
Then run down the line, damn right I'm getting mine
With a fine ass bitch, getting head, sipping wine

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Hallows Eve, Halloween, Hallowicked all the same
Fuck a trick or treat, I treat a trick with some game
Every year we lace the stage, with the wickedness
It's the wicked-wicky wonka, baby try an get with us

[Tech N9ne]
It's that nigga that be on blood shit
Tech Nina off in a thug pit
Fuck with the KMK, ICP, Bone and you'll get drug bitch
Celebrating for Samhein (Witch Killaz)
If you don't wanna come with the wickedness
A nigga wanna slam Strange
I don't wanna hear a damn thang

[Daddy-X]
Mashing off from city to city
We sparking fifties and fifties
Crashing after parties
Fucking and sucking on titties
Ducking and dodging the coppers
Ain't no one out there that can stop us
Dropping that shit that be popping
Making it hotter and hotter

[Tech N9ne]
We man handle them
Fucking and crushing on man's camera
Busting bright red bandanas
Bitch where was your antennas?
When I was trying to stick it
Wanna show a nigga how she lick it?
Motherfucker this is how we kick it
Thug whiling on Hallowicked

[Jonny Richter]
Bud so fine fine, toking all kinds
With Tech N9ne, getting more love
Sipping on hen, with Bone Thugs
Kicking Faygo, and smoking more weed with ICP
It's motherfucking Richter from the Kottonmouth Kings

[Hook: Layzie Bone & Violent J]
It ain't nowhere to run when you in the thug pit (Kottonmouth Kings!)
[It's wicked wicked wonkin within the thug pit)
We just some Thuggalos and Juggalos on some thug shit
[In this kind of mosh pit you get your wig split)
It ain't nowhere to run when you in the thug pit
[It's wicked wicked wonkin within the thug pit)
We just some Thuggalos and Juggalos on some thug shit
[In this kind of mosh pit you get your wig split)

[Krayzie Bone]
It's mista sawed off leatherface
I bring the pain, and bang a nigga brain
When I step on the plate
Guard your grill, cause when my niggas start to ill
It's hard to chill
Motherfuckers end up in the graveyard for real (Whoa!)

[Daddy-X]
I ain't got a million dollars bitch I'm fucking broke
Spending all my change on that endo smoke
All the bitches on the road, scheming for my loot
They get nothing but dick, and a steel toed boot

[Esham]
Fuck Proof, every Halloween, I dress like a bag lady
Then I ride around with my .380 looking for Shady
If I catch him at the shelter I'mma pull his file
Chop his head off, and bury his body across 8 mile

[Daddy-X]
We drinking drank (Drank)
We smoking dank (Dank)
Mobbing through these streets like a fleet of armored tanks (Tank)
We dropping bombs, underground bombs
Fuck the whole industry bitch, bring them on

[Hook #2: Layzie Bone & Judge D]

[Hook # 1: Layzie Bone & Violent J]
