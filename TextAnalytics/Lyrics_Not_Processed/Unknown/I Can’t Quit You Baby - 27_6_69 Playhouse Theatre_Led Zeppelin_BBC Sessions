Oh ooh-ooh ah yes oh, I can't quit you baby
I think I'm gonna put you down for awhile
I can't quit you, babe
I'm gonna put you down for a little while
I said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child

You know I love you, baby
You you you you you, my love for you I could never hide
You know I love you, baby
My love for you, my love for you I could never hide
But when you hear me holler, babe
You know you must be my one desire

You made my hopes so high, baby
Then you let me down so low, ah ah
You made my hopes so high, baby baby
Then you let me down so low
I think it's time to reckon with you, baby
Woman, I just don't know which way to go

Oh
