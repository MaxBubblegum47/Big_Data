[Intro]
Alright, c'mon
T-To me, girl, oh it's you

[Hook]
No matter what they say you do you know we got the whole city and we riding for you, you
And when the kids get big they gon' try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gon' try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gon' try and do it big like you

[Verse 1]
Now it's a lot on my back like J-Lo
Heaven on Earth, all I'm missing is a halo
Won't stop 'til I am the greatest on my label
When I'm all GOOD music, that's the greatest of the labels
It's hard tryna build a palace out of legos
19 got it in early like eggos
Never did anything illegal for a payroll
So without Cain I was always Abel, get it?
You dumb with it if you ain't able
And life is better with bread like mayo
So I was young like "How we gon' get paid bro?"
Now I'm on rodeo, fresher than a day old, you know
And I know the whole world is gon' see me
Mamma do I look better on TV?
I know them haters irritated as a STD
Man tell them niggas be easy, man be easy

[Hook]
No matter what they say you do you know we got the whole city and we riding for you, you
And when the kids get big they gon' try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gon' try and do it big like you, you, you, you
They gon' try and do it big like you

[Verse 2]
Man I be better, than whoever, for forever in a year
I put it on mama dear
I love the limelight shine bright, ha bing
19 living out a niggas pipe dream
I'm so legitimate
It would be ignorant
If you were not to consider this, from a true lyricist
Unless they hating on a nigga like Jena 6
