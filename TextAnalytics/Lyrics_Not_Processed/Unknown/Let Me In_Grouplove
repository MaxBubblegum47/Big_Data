Gimme, gimme that love, I'll be waitin' for ya'
Catch my hand, I'll be fightin' for ya'
Let me in, yeah, let me get closer
Got me runnin' wild like I feel it all over
Catch my hand, I'll be fightin' for ya'

All this time been trippin' and slippin' around
You got me, now I'm swimmin', swimmin' in clouds

Gimme, gimme that love, I'll be waitin' for ya'
Catch my hand, I'll be fightin' for ya'

And I'm findin' out that all I know is right at home
But I'm tellin' the man my plan to never feel alone
Let me in, yeah, let me get closer
Got my hands high like I ride a roller coaster
Cannot be it, cannot be lonely
Lookin' like you're lovin', you're livin' the moment

Got me, now I'm swimmin', swimmin' in clouds

Gimme, gimme that love, I'll be waitin' for ya'
Catch my hand, I'll be fightin' for ya'

Holdin' my breath till there's nothin' left
Hold your breath, now there's nothin' left
Gimme that love, I'll be waitin' for ya'

(Woah)

Now I'm findin' out that all I know is right at home
So I'm tellin' the man my plan to never feel alone

Gimme, gimme that love, I'll be waitin' for ya'
And catch my hand, I'll be fightin' for ya'

Holdin' my breath till there's nothing left
Hold your breath, now there's nothing left
Gimme that love, I'll be waitin for ya'
