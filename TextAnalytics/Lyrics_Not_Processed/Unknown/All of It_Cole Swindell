[Verse 1]
Little footprints in the dust on the dashboard
Radio still stuck on your station
Still taste your kiss from this mornin'
Girl you say there's another one waiting
Hope it's a long one, break of the dawn one
I want everyone you got

[Chorus]
Give me that "Let's get out of here go jump in the river"
Girl, show me what that rockin' body looks like in the firelight
Wrap me up with all that love that you been holding back your whole life
Girl I wish you would just hit me with that
Pretty little get me through tomorrow smile
Bring on all the good with all the bad I'm all about it
Anything and everything, baby you could never bring enough of it
I want all of it

[Verse 2]
I wanna see you all city light lit up
I wanna see you in a pair of cut-up jeans
I wanna fall for all your magic
Feel all your teardrops drippin' on me
The sad ones, the happy ones
I want everyone you got

[Chorus]
Give me that "Let's get out of here go jump in the river"
Girl, show me what that rockin' body looks like in the firelight
Wrap me up with all that love that you been holding back your whole life
Girl I wish you would just hit me with that
Pretty little get me through tomorrow smile
Bring on all the good with all the bad I'm all about it
Anything and everything baby you could never bring enough of it
Yeah, I want all of it

[Bridge]
Baby, I want all of it
All the time
Everything you got I wanna make all mine

[Chorus]
Give me that "Let's get out of here go jump in the river"
Girl, show me what that rockin' body looks like in the firelight
Wrap me up with all that love that you been holding back your whole life
Girl I wish you would just hit me with that
Pretty little get me through tomorrow smile
Bring on all the good with all the bad I'm all about it
Anything and everything baby you could never bring enough of it
I want all of it

(I want all of it)
