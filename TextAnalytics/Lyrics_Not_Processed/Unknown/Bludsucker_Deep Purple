[Chorus]
Got a black breast Chinese eyes
Got an English brain that's going to make me wise
Got a long story that I want to tell
To a rhythm that I know so well
Really got a lot of loving that I want to give
Baby I'm a mystery but you know I got to live
I tried another, she didn't want to know
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Take a hold now if you can
Take a lesson from a hard loving man
I'm a long way from where I want to go
Guess I'll stay a while, I really love you so
How's about another sip of all the wine you've got
Take a tip from me and give it here, I'll drink the lot
I'm not a winey, I'm putting on a show
Wah no no no

You really grab me but I got to move
Before they know I'm here and spread the news
Maybe in while when I move around
I can find a way to pay you back your twenty pounds
Really got a lot of loving that I wan to give
Baby I'm a mystery but you know I got to live
I tried another, she didn't want to know
Oh no no no

[Chorus]
Got a black breast Chinese eyes
Got an English brain that's going to make me wise
Got a long story that I want to tell
To a rhythm that I know so well
Really got a lot of loving that I want to give
Baby I'm a mystery but you know I got to live
I tried another, she didn't want to know
Oh no no no

[Outro]
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
