[Verse 1]
Going to tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
He claim he has the misery but he has a lot of fun

[Chorus]
Oh baby
Ye-e-e-eh baby
Woo-o-o-oh baby
Having me some fun tonight

[Verse 2]
Well, I saw Uncle John with bald-head Sally
He saw Aunt Mary coming
And he ducked back in the alley

[Chorus]
Oh baby
Ye-e-e-eh baby
Woo-o-o-oh baby
Having me some fun tonight
Yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, long tall Sally, she’s built for speed
She got everything that Uncle John need

[Chorus]
Oh baby
Ye-e-e-eh baby
Woo-o-o-oh baby
Having me some fun
Ahh!

[Guitar Solo]

[Post-Chorus]
We're going to have some fun tonight
Going to have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's alright
Have some fun
Have me some fun tonight
