[Chorus]
Step inside love and stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay

[Verse]
You look tired, love
Let me turn down the light
Come in out of the cold
Rest your head on my shoulder
And kiss me goodnight
We are together
Now and forever, come my way

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
(Joe Prairies and the Prairie Wallflowers
Los Paranoias
Ha ha!)

[Chorus of new song repeated multiple times with slightly different words]
Los Paranoias
Invites you to (I can't take it!)
To just enjoy us (I can't take it!)
Come on you can (I can't take it!) do it
Baby, come on and join the Los Paranoias
Just enjoy us
Los Paranoias
Oh! Los Paranoias!
Come on and join us
Harmony
Los Paranoias
Come on and join us
We're the Los Paranoias

[Verse]
We're here to sing for you
And what if you want us to
We will sing a little song for you

[Chorus]
Los Paranoias
