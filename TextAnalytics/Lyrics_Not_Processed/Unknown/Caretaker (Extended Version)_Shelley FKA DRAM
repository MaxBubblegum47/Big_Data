[Verse 1: SZA]
I'll take care of you, I will
Even if I got a man now
I heard you a fan now
It's a little bit too late to take care of me
You could still
Even if I got a man now
'least you know where I stand now
'Cause I ain't been there, 'cause I ain't been there
I ain't been there
Tell me everything you think I wanna hear
I'll take care of you, I will
Even if I got a man now
Cause I been fucking fans now

[Verse 2: D.R.A.M.]
Still let me take care of you
Even if you got a man now
Cause I been fucking fans now
In the back seat of my van now
Still I'll take care of you
Even if you got a man now
Fuck that nigga I never shake his hand now
That's why I'll be there
Ima be there, there, there (say it with me)
Cause I wasn't there
I swear, I'll be there just let me take care of you... of you
