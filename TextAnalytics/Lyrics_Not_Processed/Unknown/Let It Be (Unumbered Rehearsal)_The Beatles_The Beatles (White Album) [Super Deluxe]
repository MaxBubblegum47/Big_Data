[Intro]
Whispering words of wisdom
Let it be (let it be)
Let it be (let it be)

[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Malcolm comes to me
Whispering words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be (let it be)
Let it be (let it be)
Let it be (yeah)
Let it be (let it be)
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 2]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Malcolm comes to me
Whispering words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be
Let it be (let it be)
Let it be (let it be)
Let it be (let it be)
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be (
Should we do one with just a slide solo?
)
Let it be
Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom (
Okay, roll it Ken, roll it
)
Let it be (
Make a note of this one, because this is the one
)
Cans on, Eric
