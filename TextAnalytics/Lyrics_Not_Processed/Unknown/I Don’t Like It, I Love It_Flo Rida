[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurts
I  don't want it, I gotta, gotta have it, uh oh
When I can't find the words
I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurts
I  don't want it, I gotta, gotta have it, uh oh
When I can't find the words, I just go
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
All out, turn the beat up
Hey now I'm glad to meet ya
Turn up girl, blow the speaker

Billionaire bottles, we just down em like
Ain't no problem, all my roads are right

[Pre-Chorus 1: Flo Rida]
I don't like it, I love it

I got a anaconda in my Trukfit
Don't push it, don't push it
Cause I'ma hit it til I jackpot, that's right
Wax on baby wax off, act right
You can put it on the black card, all night
And I'll spend it, I'll spend it cause

Celebrate life and I'll pay for it
That Cavalli nice next to my Tom Ford
Yeah party all night, let's all aboard
Let's all aboard, all aboard

[Pre-Chorus 2: Flo Rida]
I don't like it, I love it
And them other girls they can't touch it
Competition, that's a whole another subject

To the metro or the condo, let's go
Perfect time gotta let it flow,

Run away for a few days
Thinkin' bout love, baby, touch√©
Tied up like a shoe lace
I don't like it, I don't like it

[Outro: Robin Thicke & Flo Rida]
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it
