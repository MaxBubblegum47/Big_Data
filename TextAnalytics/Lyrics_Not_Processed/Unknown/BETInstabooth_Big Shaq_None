Big Shaq
I tell her "Man's too hot"
I got this tune
Cooking in the pot
See my teeth?
They never rot
But I tell em'
"Man's not hot"
Yo, I got the world saying
"Skrr-pa-pa!"
Yeah, I did that
Me? I never slack
See my jacket?
It's all black
Skidi-ya pa kudu-ku boom
Yo, that's the sound that I do
I don't sing, I just link
See my ring? Bling bling
Oh, I just killed this
Ya dun' know, milked this
I like girls with big 
 uh
Nyuhh-uhh-uhh-buhh
Ya dun' know
It just grow
Yo
Under my hat
There's no afro
