[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look
Okay, I got it
When that weight's on you, I'm gon' spot it
You need to talk, what's the topic?
I've been around the block, I got mileage
Yeah, I'll ride for you
When it gets too deep, I'll die for you
When your mama got diagnosed, I swear I almost cried for you
I wish I could turn winter into July for you
I'll July 4 it, and light up the sky
I bright up the sky like the enterprise
No need to emphasize that I'm all you need
No need to hit your ex unless it's minimized
To see the bigger picture
If you're there, I'm goin' to get you
If you're here, I'm goin' with you
Honestly, see, I could go through anything
As long as I just go there with you, straight up

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me
You can lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Wanna have it all, she don't wanna go to sleep all lonely
Like a bear, she lay it all on me
Lookin' at me like Benjamin Button
Thought I told you, girl, that's the old me
I'm a new me, now if you knew me
And these girls so old like Coogi
On a cracked iPhone in the Louis
In the green room like she ain't no groupie
Gotta treat her like Aretha
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
These niggas try, that's comedy
Swear they should be on MAD TV
And we just laughin' at 'em
I'm so high, we in a canopy
Of Cali trees by the beach, yeah
Let my love in, lay your

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me
You can lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
So if you're hurting babe
Just let your heart be free
You got a friend in me
I'll be your shoulder at anytime you need
Baby I believe
So if you're hurting babe
Just let you're heart be free
You got a friend in me
I'll be your shoulder at anytime you need
Baby I believe
You can lay it all on me

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me (lay it all on me)
Lay it all on me (lay it all on me)
Lay it all on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me (lay it all on me)
Lay it all, lay it all
Lay it all (lay it all on me)
Lay it all, lay it all
Lay it all on me
Lay it all, lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Lay it all, lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
