Hold up, to be clear (yeah)

I believe in miracles (yeah)
But I don't believe in waitin' for 'em (nah)

In ways they cannot imagine (yeah)
Make them think it's magic (yeah)
It ain't your chain or your vehicles (yeah)
When you that nigga with the bag (yeah)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
You do what you do 'til you disappear
I'll take two whips for souvenirs
She said, "Swae Lee, aren't you a Gemini?"
No, I'm that nigga with the bag (woo)
Say it loud and clear (listen here)
It's loud diamonds in my ear (in my ear)
You took all day at the Gucci store (yeah)
You take all day when you in the store (yup)
But, baby, I'm not even mad
We steppin' out Ferrari, man
I got the 5 over UFO (ooh)
If you ain't spendin', what you live for?
You see, I had to customize my life (my life)
Always rollin' up in everybody's section
When you that nigga that run with the bag (bag)
You can't help but to leave a good first impression (hey)

[Chorus: Pharrell & Quavo]

Look, I work way too hard, to me, work is not a job (no)
To me, working is a purpose, I'm the closest thing to perfect (straight up)
An' I carry all my burdens, hardly ever needed help (whoa, whoa)
I'm the help my family needs, I just cash 'em out right there (right there)
I'ma eight-figure nigga by the name of Big (whoa, whoa)
That all the legends tend to big up (whoa)
'Cause where they left off's where I pick up
Bitch, I'm gone (gone)

[Verse 5: Slim Jxmmi]
I'm goin' hard for this, I put my heart in this
I'm addicted and it's hard to quit
Started off in them apartments
Now I hang with the stars and shit
Customize my cars and shit
It's her first time in a Lambo
Had to show her how to start the whip
I'm a young nigga with a bag
Watch how large it get
50K in my Amiri jeans, I fuck around and blow all this shit
Jxmmi got all the drips
You ain't never seen sauce like this, I shop on all the strips
Told shorty to lick the tip, she pulled out all the tricks

[Bridge: Station Wagon P]
Remember, insecurity sets in
You ride around like the Jetsons
You're the sun's reflection
You shinin', come on, hello

[Chorus: Pharrell]
You see that watch, that's made of glass (Yugo)
It's on the wrist that grip the bag (Yugo)
What was that spaceship ridin' past? (Yugo)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (that Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
He do one prayer and then brag (Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (that Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
He do one prayer and then brag (that Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (that Yugo, Yugo)

[Outro: Pharrell]
Go

Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
