[Intro]
(G.O.O.D.)
 (Press play, press play, press play)
Yeah
Ay

[Verse 1]
I bounce back in this bitch like a reflex
It’s obvious they trying to stop Sean like an eclipse
I’m laughing out loud to the point I might cry
Cuz nobody blocking mine like a nigga 9-9
See I am a phenom, you are a feline
You are a bitch, boi! Sweeter than key lime
D-Town
The bullets and the people seem to ménage
Hit you in your shirt, now your chest look like a collage
This is not a fairy tale or facade
Niggas tripping to the point, nowadays I’m yelling “Bon Voyage”
So in and so forth, I go in and go hard
And when it’s time to go on, bet everybody go off
Yeah, I know you niggas can’t stand my city
How they feel to hear a “Big” this good still living?
I came from the bottom
Remain at the bottom
So long, I probably made a stain at the bottom (at the bottom)
Yeah it floods when it rains at the bottom
But my dynasty reign bitch, rain till we drowning
And you’re broke until you realize something
That money’s like fucking, yup, money’s like fucking (ok)
You grind hard enough then bitch’ll keep cumming (yeah)
I’d rather keep coming in the set and see nothing
They like how he make something, when they ain’t give him nothing
How he stay proactive and kept the shit bumping (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I hop on top of tracks and just start Forrest Gumping (Gumping)
Label full of stars like the fucking flag or something
Everytime we do a show it’s like a hip. hop. summit
A beast ontop of beats, bitch my studio is haunted (is haunted?)
Please believe me boy, cuz I will ghostwrite your shit like a Ouija Board (yeah)
You hang with niggas draped in Louis Vuitton
I hang with the niggas who make Louis Vuitton
We running this shit with a baton, I promise (what)
Ima bring it home, designated driver
And all we want was money and power
Some niggas moved powder, baked, without flour (without flour)
Till they see our money rose like flour
Resort to violence cuz we can’t afford Islands (Amen)
Damn reverend we need money and a blessing (a blessing)
Just call it Creflo Dollars
Missed church service (uh huh)
My grandma say I’m reckless
She mad that I’d rather rock Jesus on my necklace (Amen)
Big cars, big cribs, big bills
Always was a big deal way before the big deal
And that’s real
