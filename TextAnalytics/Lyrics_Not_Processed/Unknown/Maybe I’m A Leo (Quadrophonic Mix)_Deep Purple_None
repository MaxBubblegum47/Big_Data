Peepin' round the door, I got a big surprise
Couldn't see a thing but open skies
They've taken her away, where is she now?
Wish that she was here, I wish she'd hold my hand
Maybe she would laugh, maybe understand
Why was I so cruel? Where is she now?
Actin' like a fool, I had to make her cry
Maybe I'm a Leo but I ain't a lion
I'm hurtin', oh so bad, I want her now
