[Intro: VEDO]
It's Vedo, baby

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
I was sittin' down yesterday
Just singin' my life away
Thinkin' bout good times
Couldn't make up my mind
I'm wishing for a better day
I need to find a happy home
'Cause I can't do this on my own
Since you were by my side
I'll be down to ride
Until the day I'm dead and gone

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees & Vedo]
'Cause I can't (I can't)
And I won't (I won't)
I won't be without you
Be without you baby

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Ohhh now I'm
Walking this lonely road
My love for you it shows
I'll give you my heart and soul
As if I'll never see you again
I know things could've been easy or different
But I'll never give up on you
If nobody loves you I do

[Verse 2: Vedo]
Everybody had their doubts
Wanted me to walk away
Said that you would do me wrong
And soon I'll be coming home (Home)
But instead I chose to fight
'Cause I've waited all my life
For you to come my way
And stay yeah

[Pre-Chorus: VEDO]
Oh I can't, I can't
And I won't, I won't
I won't be without you
Be without you

[Chorus: VEDO]
Ohhh now I'm
Walking this lonely road
My love for you it shows
I'll give you my heart and soul
As if I'll never see you again
I know things could've been easy or different
But I'll never give up on you
If nobody loves you I do

[Bridge: Jacquees & Vedo]
I do, I do
I can't be without you, be without you, baby

[Chorus: Jacquees & Vedo]
Walking this lonely road
My love for you it shows
I'll give you my heart and soul
Like I'll never see you again
I know things could've been easy or different<7i>
Never give up on you
If nobody loves you I do

[Outro: Jacquees & Vedo]
'Cause I can't
I can't and I won't
