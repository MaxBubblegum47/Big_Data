[Intro: Violator]
From the east coast ballers to the west coast riders
DJ U-Neek and Violator presents
The ghetto's top dogs. Ha ha ha...

[Chorus: Shatasha]
We're standing strong
So come on (so come on)
Get your flow on (get your flow on)

[The Notorious B.I.G]
I went from construction Timbs to Ac's with rims
Flippin' mixtapes
To bitches feedin' me grapes
Peep my mind state
Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range (Uh huh)
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's that superstar status apparatus
More wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hashes in the pocket with the 9
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline (Nigga)
I want a presidential Roley (So?)
So I crush MC's to guacamole makin' Robin scream "Holy Moley!" Big Poppa, fuck a cape I'm that Paper Crusader
Playin' Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Coolio]
I shot dice with a preacher and drank yak with a pastor
So it's me, myself and I know, my own Lord and master
When your ass was born it was all on the loan and
When it's time to die you'll be all alone so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone and
Start takin' care of your own, nigga
Everybody's schemin' with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be be tryin' to fight me
Standin' at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold, what do I see?
In the distance, some resistance

[Doodlebug]
Well, I travel the land like my man in Kung Fu
Moshin' up this hip hop scene with my Digable crew
Now you and I know the science so don't front
Cause Brooklyn won't front, naw, we don't front
In fact, it's gettin' like a daily operation
Cee Knowledge born represents my young nation
And I'm facin' opposition in every form
So my man choose Squad 7, ours is on the swarm
Like crazily cause it don't pay to be
A black man in the land of mental slavery
They say cash rules everything around me, true
So what I gotta do to be as lavish as you?
I don't roll with no crew that do the same ol' same
So I travel the seventh plane by the way of Coltrane
And that's an ill thought, niggas get caught in my wisdom
Because the number seven's like the master of a rhythm

[Big Mike]
It ain't surprisin' these motherfuckers still hatin'
They must don't know, I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated, way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike'll stomp the head of a snake
My voice was felt, when my feet hit the ground
And fakes fell when my heat made a sound
Now, all the non-believers gonna fall
When my niggas make the fuckin' final call
We started out small, now we got it steppin' nationwide
1995, how many heads are gonna fly?
With that rootin' tootin' southside shootin'
Bootin' any nigga who ain't troopin' with Huey Newton
Fuck disputin' when it's time for a change
Nigga what you gon' do when we rearrange the game?
Blow 'em out the frame with new ideas
We's about the gang lyrics, puttin' it down out here

[Chorus: Shatasha]
We're standing strong
So come on (so come on)
Get your flow on (get your flow on)

[Buckshot]
I step in the jam with the God on my side
And the God S.T. is still waitin' in the ride, so I
Step to the DJ and tell the DJ, "Yo' throw the wax on"
How many MC's must get dissed?
The mist from the blunt smoke decides who's next on my list
Can you feel the hiss from the snake movin' my direction?
No U-turn, you're gettin' burned from the sun in my intersection (uh)
The God has spoken, sword strokin'
If you think you ready for a fair one, pay your token
On my soul train, control your brain
Buck Town representative break it down like a key of cocaine
Straight from the lab
And I still elevate past the snakes and the crabs
Fuck it (Boot Camp Clik)

[Redman]
Huh, it's that Funkdelic, Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it (what?)
Fuck the vest, niggas better start puttin' on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk comin' in stacks, bullets hummin' from gats
So I duck, lyrical buck buck, get stuck
I'm jammin' like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That caused the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
Bladow! Blast my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leavin' your mic boney like that Tales of The Crypt bitch
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, now I'm bustin' your ass counter clockwise
I get dumb, but dumber, while your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo, za-hurrs

[Menace Clan]
Ayo, mayday mayday! Raise the white flag, let the pants sag
Fuck a drag (Ima puff the whole bag)
Yeah, it's the low down and I'm low-key, The O.G
Niggas know me (true), so take it easy like Moby
The ex-convict on some Vietnam shit, criminal
On the subliminal (niggas) watch what your women do
All the bitches wanna know why the frames I (ride)
That's just the Glock, that glare from the (glide)
Bear witness (to my mental fitness, no fear)
Precaution (may be) too severe (for your ear)
Yeah, creep around, bro, on the down low
Let off a round slow (subtle) And leave you in a puddle (So uh)
Breaker breaker one nine
'cause It ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (c'mon)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (c'mon)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
It's like that

[Rock of Helter Skelter]
Hey yo, I can rhyme as long as my dick get pumped
I grabs the mic and do what the fuck I want
I'll outlast any blunt, White Owl, Philly, or a Dutch Master
Raw like a natural disaster
As I crack ya, ass like cheap plaster
I might bash ya, while my tongue lash ya
When the Rock rolls I crash ya, leave ya like a car wreck
Then I give a tribute to the Rippa Tech
And I slash ya, after I'm sure that you're ghost
I go see my bro with the 'fro and we toast
All the punks 'pon the planet, plus every single fool
Cause without all of 'yall, Helter Skelter wouldn't rule
And we do

[Layzie Bone]
Puttin' your shit to tha pave, endin' up meetin' the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazed
But they never did phase Bone
My deadly pistol brothers, ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, ya dearly departed, better off

[Wish Bone]
Been labeled a psychopath, fall down with a buck and a blast, when given my chance
You niggas who fearin' my sawed-off, put me to rest, so fast to blast
So if you thinkin' of kickin' it, you best be packin' your shit you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cause I'm mowing you down with the quickness

[Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, buckin' em once again
And niggas they pick up the pen and they try to contend
But see what they win is that MAC-10
There's never another to go with a brother, I'll smother a sucker
And go undercover, we leave 'em in gutters, they claim to get down
But come through with the sucka that squealed on the murder?

[Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street sweeper
When I reap I pray the bullet'll put in much work
Put in much dirt, wet shirt, puttin' the bullet just where it hurts and umm..
Wit' a me Tech I stepped up, runnin wit' a buck
Po-Po's won't let a me duck, gonna be a set up, wet up
Get 'em when I get 'em, Bone don't let up

[Chorus: Shatasha]
We're standing strong
So come on (so come on)
Get your flow on (get your flow on)

[Jamal]
Ayo, Jamal gets down, the master of bringing the massacre
Rollin' on Crews like Pirellies on Acuras
If you don't believe my steez is real
You can check the emptiness of my Glock nine mil
It don't matter which way you come
I still be the nigga callin' shots with the gun
I lick one shot, I make your whole squad run
None, Is about to fuck with the sun Mally G
I never kick a rhyme for free
Function rap skills, I come live like T.V. (word up)
For all of y'all, I come across to be real
With super shit like Fall Guy
And lines to make them all die
Infrared beams, mind full of schemes
'95 until, keep it real, get the cream (Yeah)

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You better believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around my people start subtractin'
They cause this shit then they wonder why we start overreactin'
Hey-ey-ey! You can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'ma hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me go inside, please give me room, yo step aside, ha!
Those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there droppin' dimes
Get yo' shit drawers up out my hamper
Young survivalist represent the next Black Panther

[5th Ward]
Where you from, fool? (Studio Wood, Fifth Ward)
Bustin' caps on that ass, real niggas stay hard
Sex and ass like the man Uncle Sam
The hardest motherfucker recorded on 
Past Scam
And when I die, please bury me a G
The fascia was, and bright flowers ain't necessary
I fantasize dead bodies in a creek
Wake up in the morning screamin' "murder" in my sleep
I'm goin' crazy, Lord have mercy
A hellraisin' thug, somebody save me

[Chorus: Shatasha]
We're standing strong
So come on (so come on)
Get your flow on (get your flow on)
We're standing strong
So come on (so come on)
Get your flow on (get your flow on)
