[BURR]
How does the hot-headed, short-tempered
Protean creator of the Coast Guard
Founder of the New York Post
Ardently abuse his cab’net post
Destroy his reputation?
Welcome folks, to

[BURR/COMPANY]
The Adams administration!

[BURR]
Jefferson’s the runner-up, which makes him the vice president

[JEFFERSON]
Washington can’t help you now, no more mister nice president

[BURR]
Adams fires Hamilton
Calling him the “creole bastard” in his taunts

[JEFFERSON]
No!

[BURR]
Hamilton publishes his response

[HAMILTON]
An open letter
 to 
the fat,
 
arrogant, anti-charismatic
National embarrassment
 
known as President John Adams

[BURR]
Shit

[HAMILTON]
The man's irrational, 
he claims that I'm in league
With Britain in some vast, international intrigue
Bitch, please,
 
you wouldn't know what I'm doin'
You're always goin' berserk,
 
but you never show up to work
Give my regards to Abigail
Next time you write about my lack of moral compass
At least I'm doin' my job up in this rumpus

[COMPANY]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
The line is behind me, I crossed it again
Well, the President lost it again
Aww, such a rough life, better run to your wife
Yo, the boss is in Boston again
Lemme ask you a question: Who sits
At your desk when you're in Massachusetts?
They were calling you a dick back in '76
And you haven't done anything 
new since!
You're a nuisance! with no sense!
 
You will die of irrelevance!
Go ahead: You can call me the Devil
You aspire to my level, you aspire to malevolence!
Say hi to the Jeffersons!
And the spies all around me
, maybe they can confirm
I don't care if I kill my career with this letter
I'm confining you to one term
You fat mother—!

[Hamilton drops a thick tome of paper on the floor. The Company explodes.]

[BURR, spoken]
He's out of control!

[MADISON, spoken]
No! It's fine. He’s out of power, he holds no office, and he just destroyed the only other significant member of his party—

[JEFFERSON, spoken]
He’s a host unto himself. 
As long as he can hold a pen, he’s a threat. Let’s let him know what we know
