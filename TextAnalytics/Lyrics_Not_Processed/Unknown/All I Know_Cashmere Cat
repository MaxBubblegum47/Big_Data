[Intro: The Weeknd]
(Woo, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo, ooh-ooh, woo, ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
The reasons I can't have you, are so easy to fix
I didn't really plan to, but I'ma do it for thi-i-is
The reasons I can't have you, isn't so complicated
Baby, if you let me, I won't hesita-a-ate

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
All I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I know there's been stigma 'round me
I know you heard things about me
You sleep one eye closed, too scared to get heartbroke
Heard too many lies told, don't make this shit my fault
I could tell why you would doubt me
I hit one time, you can't live without me
Girl I'm just peakin', I'm just tryna be on top of you, on top of you, ooh

[Chorus: The Weeknd & 
Future
]
All I know (
All I know, all I know, all I
)
All I know is this (
All I know, all I know, all I
)
All I know (
All I know, all I know, all I know
)
All I know is this (
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know
)
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
Is this, is this

[Interlude: The Weeknd]
(Woo, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo, ooh-ooh, woo, ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo, ooh-ooh, woo, ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3: Future & 
The Weeknd
]
S-s-sleep with one eye open
I'm terrified to get my heart broke
Blood talkin' like a Piru
Fuck with me, nigga, you gon' die slow (Gang)
Lamborghini make you Crip walk (Skrrt)
I'm smashin' off with my side ho
Full of these medicals, bitches, got several
She eat the dick up like it's an edible
Then I get back to my capital
I got the Glock on the passenger
I got these tropical fantasies
They gon' remember my legacy
Hang out the roof of the Ghost
The cash in my pocket spill right on the floor
The cash in my pocket spill out in the floor
When the cash overflow, let the cash overflow
I done fucked a bitch that bougie (Yeah)
Have you ever, ever fucked a bitch that bougie? (
Oh-ooh-ooh
)
I done fucked a bitch that bougie
I done, I done, I done fucked a bitch that bougie (
Oh, ooh
)
I done fucked a bitch conceited
I done fucked a few, few bitches conceited (
Oh, yeah
)
We just wanna say we did it
We just wanna say we did it (They say)
I know like you know
I keep that trigger beside me (Keep that trigg')
I know like you know
You just another body (
Oh
)
I know like you know
I keep that trigger beside me (Keep that trigg') (
Oh, oh
)
I know like you know
You just another body (Just another body)
Have you fucked a bitch this pretty?
Hit her on the first night and went and bought titties
Have you fucked a bitch this pretty?
Hit her on the first night and went and bought titties (Bought what?)
Niggas always sneak dissin'
We gon' continue fuckin' they bitches
I ain't just fucking that bitch
I been the one makin' love to that bitch

[Chorus: Future]
All I know (All I know, all I know, all I)
All I know is this (All I know, all I know, all I)
All I know (All I know, all I know, all I know)
All I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know...
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
Is this, is this
