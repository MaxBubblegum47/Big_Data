[Verse 1]
Looking through your window
Maybe you're not home, oh
I tried to call your number
So now I leave another message on your phone, oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a stalker, I just gotta know
How it feels when I hold you close
So tell me what you like
'Cause I'm runnin' out of time
Promise you I'm not insane
Somethin' 'bout you that I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind

[Chorus]
Yeah, all I wanna do is make love to you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right
All I wanna do is stay the night with you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right, yeah

[Verse 2]
Staring at your picture
It's hanging on my wall
Yeah, I even called your mama
To ask her how to get through to your heart
And I said

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a stalker, I just gotta know
How it feels when I hold her close
So tell me what she likes
'Cause I'm runnin' out of time
Promise you I'm not insane
Somethin' 'bout her that I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind

[Chorus]
Yeah, all I wanna do is make love to you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right
All I wanna do is stay the night with you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right
Yeah, all I wanna do is make love to you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right
All I wanna do is stay the night with you
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'll hold you tight, treat your body right, yeah
