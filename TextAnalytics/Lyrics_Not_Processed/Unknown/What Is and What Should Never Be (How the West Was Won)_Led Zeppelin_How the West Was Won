[Verse 1]
And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me, yeah
It's to a castle I will take you
Well what's to be, they say will be

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave the day
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ahh yeah

[Verse 2]
And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be, yeah
What's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be, ahh I said

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
Oh, by takin' our time ooooh, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha baby

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new, yeah
And happiness is what everybody needs so bad
Well, lemme tell ya, the answer lies in you, oh yes

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave the day
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooooh

[Outro]
Well, the wind won't blow and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show, yeah
Ride the wind, we're gonna see it spin
Gonna sh

Ma-ma do, ma-ma ma doo, go

Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they really didn't know that I fall out o' hell
Baby baby baby, just give me the good things, mama love ya
Oh yes, uh-huh
Oh, you just sold out on me
