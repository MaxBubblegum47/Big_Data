[Intro: YK Osiris, 
DaBaby
 & 
Gucci Mane
]
Ohh
Yeah, it's like, it's like some of that ghetto gospel shit
Yeah, 
yeah
 (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)

[Chorus: DaBaby & 
YK Osiris
]
This shit right here sound like some gospel
I lost my daddy the same week that they lost Nipsey (
Nipsey, yeah
)
Ain't got no love left in my heart, my shit be empty (
Empty, yeah, yeah
)
I'm ready to fire on all my opps, let a nigga tempt me (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
And the day I die, I bet lil' Jon goin' down in history
'Cause I've been solo, rockin' Dolo, I've been stuntin'
No, ho, it's a no-go, I don't want you (Yeah)
And everybody wonderin' why he come around and don't say nothin'
'Cause it been so long, it been so long
I came from nothin'

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
Lemme pop my shit
I came from shit, three of us and my mom, she couldn't pay rent
Two jobs, all alone, she couldn't quit
We was home alone when we was jits
That was before I was grown, before I was on
I ain't had no shoes, I ain't had no clothes
Lemme wear your shoes, lemme fuck your bitch
I ain't had no car, I ain't had no whip
Wonder why a nigga cover his ears when y'all talk
'Cause it ain't nobody could tell me shit
I spent 30K on my daughter birthday, everybody had fun
Nigga, everybody lit
When a nigga go home, I don't answer my phone
Everybody want to leech, everybody want a loan
Everybody wanna talk, everybody wanna clique
I don't wanna be friends and get off my dick
I ain't had time to think, I ain't had time to breathe
I've been prayin' to the Lord, I've been talkin' on my knees
I been thinkin' 'bout my pops, I been thinkin' about my opps
Thinkin' how can I stop me a nigga when he breathin'
When a nigga play with me, I ain't lookin' for my phone
I ain't finna drive away, I ain't lookin' for my keys
The fuck these niggas know about me?

No, ho, it's a no-go, I don't want you  (I don't want nothin', yeah, yeah)
And everybody wonderin' why he come around and don't say nothin'
'Cause it been so long, it been so long

Chance The Rapper

I came from nothin' (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Put yourself in my shoes, like I abandoned the race
And you ran in my place
Shoes too big, but they use hair strands as a lace, and they break
When it's hot outside, you don't want fans in your face (Ah)
But you might want a fan in your face
When yo' man got a heat and the hand in the waist (Band)
Gotta keep a cool head, niggas got PTSD these days (Yeah)
Some folks ain't live to see these days (Yeah)
I be in the lab like Dex, coolin', takin' these Dee Dee breaks (Long)
The PD way, I could write a book like TD Jakes (Yeah, yeah)
Walkin' 'round my city in some house shoes
Know that they always wanted someone they could honk and shout to (Yeah, yeah)
Just gotta remember, got a family in the house, too (Yeah, yeah)
Don't get caught up with the one that still function without you (Yeah, yeah)

'Cause it been so long, it been so long
I came from nothin'

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I'm the only nigga left, homie
It ain't right how they all went left on me
Niggas took my heart and they stepped on it (Wow)
Lately, I've been hangin' by myself, homie (Huh)
These fuck niggas made me sick, they got me nauseous (Ugh)
Paranoid, all this money movin' cautious (Cautious)
Flippin' quarters on a corner to a baller (Skrrt)
Run up on Gucci, you gon' see the coroner
Bright carats on my chest not pointers (Brrr)
Paris freshin', we fresh like a foreigner (Huh)
Nigga tried to rob me, now he a goner (Whew)
Gucci Mane preach the gospel to the mourners (Haha)
Guwap, yeah
