[Intro: Iggy Azalea]
Uh-huh! It's Iggy Iggs!
I got one more problem with you girl, hey!

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya
(I want you)
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
(I want you)
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it
(I want you)

[Pre-Hook: Ariana Grande]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

[Hook: Big Sean + (Ariana Grande)]
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem)
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem)

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
(But it's you)
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back
(But it's you)
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
(But it's you)

[Pre-Hook: Ariana Grande]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

[Hook: Big Sean + (Ariana Grande)]
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem)
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya (ooh, babe)
I got one less problem without ya (ooh, woah)
(I got one less, one less problem)

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
It's Iggy Iggs!
Uh, what you got?
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know
But I really, really doubt you understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem

[Pre-Hook: Ariana Grande]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

[Hook: Big Sean + (Ariana Grande)]
One less problem without ya (hey)
I got one less problem without ya (no, babe)
I got one less problem without ya (ooh, ooh, baby)
(I got one less, one less problem)
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya (woo, hey!)
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem, problem)
One less problem without ya (hey)
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less, yeah)
(I got one less, one less problem)
