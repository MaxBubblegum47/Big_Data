[Chorus Billie Eilish]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 1: Melanie Martinez]
Over my shoulder, eyes peeking in
Analyze my every move, what current state I'm in
'Cause you are colder (brrr) than ice on my skin
Wanna get that A+, baby, so you take my shit
'Cause I am little, right? I won't call you out
Teachers saying you'd get credit, why would you stop now?
You are so desperate, craving that spotlight
Shine it on the ones who do that shit, 'cause it's their life

[Pre-Chorus: Melanie Martinez]
But I know the people around you say
"Just do what it takes to make it all the way"

[Chorus: Melanie Martinez]
You're a copy cat
And you take it then you leave it
Honey, just like that, just like that
You're falling flat
You find someone like me to bring you up right back
Up right back

[Chorus Billie Eilish]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Billie Eilish, Circus-P]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're really just a clone
I can't figure out the reason why I'd kinda like to see you cry"
I can't remember who I am
Cause everything's a blur
Take me over

[Chorus: Melanie Martinez, Billie Eilish]
You're a copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

You're a copy cat
And you take it then you leave it
Honey, just like that, just like that
You're falling flat
You find someone like me to bring you up right back
Up right back

[Chorus Billie Eilish]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse: Melanie Martinez]
Find someone else to leech on, lady
My blood's for me, not for you, babe
College estate and all your savings
My blood's for me, so no more taking

[Verse: Tierra Whack]
Anything you can do, I can do better
Imprisoned for stealing, gon' write you a letter
Courageous and clever, creative director
I raised the bar high, yes sir, I broke the record

[Bridge, Circus-P]
I would hate to see you go
I can't remember who I am
Cause everything's a blur
Take me over
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

[Melanie Martinez, Billie Eilish]
You're a copy cat
And you take it then you leave it
Honey, just like that, just like that
You're falling flat
You find someone like me to bring you up right back
Up right back

Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

You're a copy cat
And you take it then you leave it
Honey, just like that, just like that
You find someone like me to bring you up right back
