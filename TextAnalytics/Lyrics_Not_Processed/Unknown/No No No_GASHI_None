[Chorus]
Pull up in a phantom when it's dark outside
Pull up at the party when it's dark outside
All of these people they down to ride
Look at my eyes
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no

[Verse 1]
Keepin' it real I say how I feel
Shoutout my old management, you missed on a mil
I'm worth a mil, a couple of million
Fuck all these rappers, they all are my children
All of these dinosaurs old as fuck talkin down on me
You know it's a shame
I guess they scared of me cause now that I am around
Their money isn't the same
Did it with no favors had enough pull that
I could of pulled me up a train
Shout out to Snake
That's my brother for life
Good or bad times you know we cannot break
Hit after hit after hit hit after hit
You know we never gon' miss
And if you're wondering why my fans love me so much
Cause you know I be writing my own shit
And my girl showed me her DMs
You suckers need to really go get your own bitch
All of these artists they play me their music
I laugh because they don't really own shit

[Chorus]
Pull up in a phantom when it's dark outside
Pull up at the party when it's dark outside
All of these people they down to ride
Look at my eyes
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no

[Verse 2]
They be the fakest I be the realest
All of my fans they be throwin their 4s at my shows and I kill it
They sing all my lyrics, I be the trillest
You lying to yourself
Fuck you and your mama if you say you don't feel this
Fuck em all, fuck em all, fuck em all
Swear that they never believed me
Now when I walk in these labels
Just look at how the fuck they all treat me
These rappers they all wanna be me
On blood, I swear they cannot see me
I just pulled up in a foreign surrounded by sqaures, like I'm coppin' a TV
I put myself on ain't waitin' on Flom
Getting more pussy than your girl's tampon
Now let's get it on
Her face got more babies than a Fetty song
She said this is her song
Ate me a steak then I fed her a bone
If your money short we can't get along
Leave me alone

[Chorus]
Pull up in a phantom when it's dark outside
Pull up at the party when it's dark outside
All of these people they down to ride
Look at my eyes
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no
