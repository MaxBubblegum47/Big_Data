[Intro]
Taz countin' all this fuckin' money
CashMoneyAP
Git, git, grrrrrah
Git, git, grrrrrah
Desiigner

[Chorus: Desiigner]
Let me tell you how it is
I'm on some real life shit, life, real life shit
Never satisfied when you're goin' past rich
Throws a lot of money put some bread on caskets
They don't wan' see you ball they just want a draft pick
I'm on some real life shit, life, real life shit
Never satisfied when you're goin' past rich
Throws a lot of money put some bread on caskets
They don't wan' see you ball they just want a draft pick

[Verse 1: Desiigner]
Told me stay away from the bullshit
Stay focused, here the rhymin'
Shout to Big Blood, fuck the police
Heard Trump in the county
I seen niggas Feds
When I pulled up, yeah and he's frownin'
Yeah niggas get bounties here
Hit the ocean, (grrrrrah) he drownin'
Bounce bitch, beat bouncin'
Hashtag, click, pound
Niggas talk shit or freestyle
Fuck them, everybody stylin'
Hot 97 turn to 9/11
When the MAC 11, streets rhymin'
Pop off these diamonds
Make a DJ get down with it

[Chorus: Big Sean & Desiigner]
I'm on some real life shit, yeah, real life shit
Never satisfied when you're goin' past rich
Blow a lot of money put bread on caskets
They don't wan' see you ball they just want a draft pick
I'm on some real life shit, life, real life shit (woah)
Never satisfied when you're goin' past rich (straight up)
Throws a lot of money put some bread on caskets
They don't wan' see you ball they just want a draft pick

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I could have said this on night life
Like a Saturday night life (damn)
No game show, but the price right
Niggas pop-pop-pop-pop-pop
Everything pre-meditated
I get my exceperation
I get my day meditation
I gave my life elevation (God)
Fuck with me, that's detonation
Niggas got nerve
Niggas sayin' they a beast
I turn your ass to a fur, fur
Oh my God, I gotta get it in, oh
I'm in a presidential suite with a Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus: Desiigner & Big Sean]
I'm on some real life shit, life, real life shit (boi)
Never satisfied when you're goin' past rich
Throws a lot of money put some bread on caskets
They don't wan' see you ball they just want a draft pick
I'm on some real life shit, life, real life shit
Never satisfied when you're goin' past rich
Throws a lot of money put some bread on caskets
They don't wan' see you ball they just want a draft pick

[Bridge: Big Sean & Desiigner]
My girl is the finest (finest)
My outfit designer (git)
My nigga Desiigner (grrrrrrah)
Trust I know where to find ya

[Chorus: Big Sean & Desiigner]
I'm on some real life shit, yeah, real life shit
Never satisfied when you're goin' past rich
Throws a lot of money put some bread on caskets
They don't wan' see you ball they just want a draft pick
I'm on some real life shit, life, real life shit (woah)
Never satisfied when you're goin' past rich (straight up)
Throws a lot of money put some bread on caskets
They don't wan' see you ball they just want a draft pick
