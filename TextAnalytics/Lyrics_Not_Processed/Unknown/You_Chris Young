[Verse 1]
The bluest skies don't seem so blue
And the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
Now that you're around, you put 'em all to shame
Let me break it down 'cause what I'm trying to say is

[Chorus]
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

[Verse 2]
Gotta whole new direction, it seems, these days
I used to rush off to work and get home late
But now I show up late and rush back home
My priorities are different, I can't leave you alone

[Chorus]
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

[Bridge]
Girl, if you ever get to guessing if I'm thinking 'bout you
Just remember that

[Chorus]
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you, you, you
You, oh, you
