[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Most niggas think I'm redundant
Because I like to take my shopping sprees out in London
I go to the can
I go shop in Japan
A diamond black card I get as much as I can, man
My set of chains seems so real
Imagination change the way that it feels
'Cause it's soft
Ice Creams and Dunks
My girl rock Louis Vuitton pumps you'd ask how much it costs
My nigga I go hard, I rock Goyard, Supreme- oh God
Thought I had to wear black just to kick bush
'Till a mechanic button pushed me just to get pushed
Niggas know I'm a teenage millionaire
Got Polos to match every color Care Bear
I get fit with Ralph Lauren, white tees is borin'
That's why I rock the best
My nigga get fresh

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm color coordinated (get fresh)
Man I color coordinated this so (get fresh)
He is color coordinated (it's fresh)

[Verse 2: Burtono]
Yeah, all white Polos, self title'd jeans
Philiano Burtono, dog on everything
Ya boy Philiano is OTC
And as a boy I'd shop out this country
Ya boy Philiano got his own clothing
What's the name of it? It's named after me
You ain't gotta stay tuned, this ain't a cartoon
Son, where in apartments Burtono, it's coming soon
Red, white, blue, that's so fresh
Black on black, you look like a mess
The funny part about it, I'm so funny
I'm so fresh to death, I sweat money
I love it, chillin' in the public
300 bucks for the Rock & Republics
I don't know, but I'm not the best
I stay, I'm just tryna impress
But just get fresh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I go to Beverly Hills for perfection
Just so I can scope out the new Polo Hanson
My own clothing gives me an erection
I like to jack off to my own clothing
Nigga, check my wallet and see how much I'm holding
A new Bathing Ape t-shirt I'm unfolding
Cuffed pants, 
Bloxhead
 main attraction
Where my jeans now have a creative reaction
When my jeans get ripped up from my crew
Probably because my new printing label look blue
Orange, yellow, green, pink I got fits
My closet has thicker silicone than Lil Kim's tits
And as you could tell I'm on a mission
'Cause I got more True Religion than a Christian
I'm rockin in public, Banana Republic
You rockin Akademik jeans? I'm rockin Rock & Republic
(????) My flow is sicker than (???) havin sex
And you know what's next, I'm one of the best
Yes, I'm not even gonna tell you the rest
My nigga get fresh

[Outro]
Oooh, yeah
