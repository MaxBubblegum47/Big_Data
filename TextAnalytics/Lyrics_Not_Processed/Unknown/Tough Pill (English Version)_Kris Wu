[Verse 1]
As soon as I hit the streets
People on look out for me
I'm trying to live it up modest
Not the typical thing that you see
When I'm moving fast
I camouflage
Getting tied up in the hot seat
I got my own
Nah I can't be cloned
And I  set the tone
When the dark is out
You won't see no stars like this
No one's raising the bar like this
And if you're doubting
Point em out
And send them round
Ask 'em if they know me yeah yeah
Sometimes I just wanna be alone

[Chorus]
Two cents you can keep the change
Penny for your thoughts
I'mma stay the same
Try to poke a man, on the go
Wanna catch 'em slip
And end 'em like a game
Tell 'em I'm a man
Ordinary with extraordinary gifts I know ya know
Writing stories just to talk about me
Go head talk about me cause it's all a show
Truth can be a tough pill to swallow
Something 'bout fame make 'em act so shallow
Taking shots at me like a hollow
Oh yeah
Yeah
Truth can be a tough pill to swallow
Something 'bout fame make 'em act so shallow
Taking shots at me like a hollow
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Fans on fans taking pictures all day
Pull up to the crib people in my driveway
All these new faces man I don't know y'all
Got me up and down like a roller coaster
I've been on the road gettin' to the money
What you want me to do
It's all on me walk in my shoes
Life chose me
I ain't have to choose

[Chorus]
Two cents you can keep ya change
Penny for ya thoughts
I'mma stay the same
Try to poke a man, on the go
Wanna catch 'em slip
And end 'em like a game
Tell 'em I'm a man
Ordinary with extraordinary gifts I know ya know
Writing stories just to talk about me
Go head talk about me cause it's all a show
Oh yeah
Truth can be a tough pill to swallow
Something 'bout fame make 'em act so shallow
Taking shots at me like a hollow
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
这是命运 你和我都懂
别找借口 不需要理由
别说太多 你和我都懂
我的命运 我自己掌控

[Chorus]
Truth can be a tough pill to swallow
Something 'bout fame make 'em act so shallow
Taking shots at me like a hollow
Oh yeah
Yeah
Truth can be a tough pill to swallow
Something 'bout fame make 'em act so shallow
Taking shots at me like a hollow
Oh yeah
