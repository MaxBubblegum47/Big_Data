[Intro]
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la

[Verse 1]
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
(
Sha la la la la
)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, oh
Many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
Can't help myself

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, it's you (
Sha la la la la la la
)
Baby, it's you (
Sha la la la la la la
)
(
Sha la la la la
)

[Verse 2]
You should hear what they say about you, "cheat," "cheat"
(
Sha la la la la
)
They say, they say you never never never ever been true
(
Cheat, cheat
)

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm going to love you any old way
What can I do? And it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, it's you (
Sha la la la la la la
)
Baby, it's you (
Sha la la la la la la
)

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm going to love you any old way
What can I do? When it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, it's you (
Sha la la la la la la
)
Baby, it's you (
Sha la la la la la la
)

[Outro]
Don't leave me all alone (
Sha la la la la la la
)
Come on home (
Sha la la la la la la
)
'Cause, baby, it's you
