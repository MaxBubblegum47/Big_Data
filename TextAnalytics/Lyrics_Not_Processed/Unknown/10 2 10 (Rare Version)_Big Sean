[Chorus]

I woke up working like I'm Mexican (I look up)
That mean I work from 10 2 10
Then 10 2 10 - then 10 again
Nightmares are losing everything, boost my adrenaline

[Verse 1]

I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican, doh
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian, doh
I'm gettin' money like the doctors mane
'Cept - 'cept I ain't got no patients, doh

All this bread can't be too good for my cholesterol (No)
Don't come round talkin' loudly, fucking up my repertoire - dog
I can't lie, bruh lately I've been stressing heavily
I'm sippin', poppin', smokin' on whatever takes the pressure off

You bitch you, FF Imperial to my burial
Dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti-Fuck-Boy-Material, until I'm dead, I'm living proof
If you focus on what's in front of you, and not what's in the peripheral - Let's go!

Word? Boy I seen drama on drama (Boy)
Drama on drama, over comma on comma
I'm bringing home Dead Prez - my house done feel like it's haunted
I put the city on my back, right along with my garments, went to sleep snoring

[Chorus]

I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 2 10
Then 10 2 10 - then 10 again
Nightmares are losing everything, boost my adrenaline

[Verse 2]

I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican, doh
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian, doh
1 cook, 1 clean, the other PMS'ing (Oh)
No hable Ingles if police have questions - they don't know what that mean nigga (Nigga)

They say Detroit going through 'The Great Depression' still (Uh-huh)
It's been depressed so long, boy I can't even tell depression here
My homeboy still gon' pull up on 'em - rims big as a ferris wheel (Swerve)
So many rides up on the curb, my lil' cuz thought the fair was here

Like Oh, I'm Primo, top spot redeemed ho' - for who?
My team - and we might take a trip to Bermuda, Montego, pussy and flamingos
Got me thinking: Fuck I need to sleep for? Haaa?

[Closing Chorus]

I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 2 10
Then 10 2 10 - then 10 again
Nightmares are losing everything, boost my adrenaline

I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican, doh
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian, doh
I'm gettin' money like the doctors mane
'Cept - 'cept I ain't got no patients, doh - mhm
