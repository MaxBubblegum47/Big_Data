This that Zu shit,

Niggas talkin' all that shit but they ain't really doin' it
Niggas say that he a goon, he ain't tryna prove it
CSPG be the movement,

This that motherfuckin' Zu shit but this that new shit
I never gave a fuck like I'm a prude,
 bitch, just know I do's this
Your stuff drier than a prune, bitch

My bullets, they aren't acoustic,

And that purp' gettin' smoked, put that on my broom stick
Cultivatin' all the racks off these fuckin' 'shrooms, bitch

You a fuck nigga, I can't fuck with ya
Wig split, peel 'em, pussy nigga killa
Face, I'ma stomp, body dumped in my trunk, bitch
Glock by my dick, if you tweak, I'ma stick, ayy
Fuck do you mean? Aim that beam at your spleen
If you Purrp, I'll put your face in the dirt
