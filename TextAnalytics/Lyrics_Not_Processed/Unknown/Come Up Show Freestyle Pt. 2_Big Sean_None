[Intro: Cosmic Kev]
Cosmic Show, Cosmic Kev
Big Sean in the building
Part 2, right back at it baby

[Intro: Big Sean]
Straight up, Philly what up though?
Detroit

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah you guessed it
Finally Famous in this thing, we finessin'
Cartier lenses on me, ain't no question
Oh in and out of town
I ain't slept in
Weeks
You ready?
Look I been in and out town
Still making plays even when I'm out of bounds
Automatic champagne poppin', never out of rounds
Tell me where the throne at, that's where I be sitting down
I run up in your city, run a spot, run a town
Bet I run that motherfucker even when I'm not around
Only time to fuck, not to fuck around
I got weed, bad bitches, and money and they all a hundred pounds
God damn, I am (for pot pans), turn that shit straight to hot sand
Yea I got the blue print, these niggas tryna' trace
They tell me slow down but I'm in the human race
And I be damn if I ain't first, never living in reverse
I just hit it from reverse, swear that shit so crazy
Man L.A girls so crazy, how's it sunny if them hoes there shady?
And New York bitches screaming fuck you pay me
In ATL they be eating all their gravy
And Detroit man them girls so gangsta'
In Philly, I seen some pretty faces
Look, I love it when she up and down the pole
Make me wanna' take your ass up and down in Khol's
Have you ever been in Napa where they champagne, sipped in
Fly across the border to the 4-1-6, then go up to Philly where they know this shit legit
One time for the hood, man you know that we the shit
Come through in the city and you know, East Philly and you know I'm reppin' Philly
Man shout out to Meek Milly, I be going in this bitch, tell 'em silly
Oh god damn, we should pop a wheelie

[Verse 2]
Dream Chasers, what up though?
It's that Finally Famous boy, we out here reppin'
Since day one, look
I got a lot on my mind, I got more on my face
If I ain't going to get it, that day is going to waste
I'm trying to move in my safe, like the safe was a safe house
I ain't going out to eat, but these hoes stay on a steak out
Oh you know it's official when I go bring in that (paper)
I'm looking through them magazines like this the girl I'm a take out
One time for Detroit, yea you know that's what stay out
Man you know, plotin' up in there man to find a way way out
Find a way way out, we had to fire our way way out
Music been bumpin' man we just waiting to break out
This the player you heard of, the young and assertive
I came from the dirt up and did it ya heard up
Hoes say I'm the man, 'uh huh I concur it
I'm young and perverted
If I don't get the pussy or the payment what the fuck is the purpose
No calling' my phone unless you the fam or my girl
I'm a just say there's no service, stayed connected it's cursive

[Cosmic Kev]
Hold up, we about to switch it off

[Sean]
I was just finna go off.. Quill what up tho

[Verse 3]
Live life
Get High
Change the world, man do it all before you go
In Europe riding European so it's not a foreign though
They like "Show me the Moves", no time for a tutorial
There's levels to the game like "who put this shit on story mode"
His story; historical
Mister Anderson, I know Sway ain't got the answers so I'm looking for the oracle
All my favorite rappers told me "Life's a bitch"
So I'mma fuck the world through the glory hole
So that bitch can't take me to the Maury show
If she don't smoke weed, pop pills, suck d***
If there's one thing that I hate, man it's boring hoes
All my girls love me, so if I die today it'll be like 5,011 somethin' freaks at the memorial, ya bish
I hop up on the beat like it's the '08 me
When we was riding 4 deep boy no AC
Heading to the game for OK seats
Now I'm courtside at OKC
I know KD
And all these singer girls know me like 'Doe Rae Me'
Foh Sa Lah Tee Doe, but dope come first
No late fees
Kool-Aid smile
Colgate Teeth
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks
Woop Woop
Got a couple screws loose
You was in the winner's circle you just tryna get off in the fruit
Fruit Loop
Turned nothing into two, something into new
I could write a best seller out of Alphabet Soup

[Verse 4]
It Goes: Try Me, Try Me
I'mma get his whole mothafuckin' family
Look I ain't playin' with nobody
I come from 6 Mile, I ain't a cosby
Understand I came up nigga, yeah that's all me
The world is in my palm, mothafucka I need palm trees

Hol' Up, Hol'up
This is a special record ... I may need to go on this for real
