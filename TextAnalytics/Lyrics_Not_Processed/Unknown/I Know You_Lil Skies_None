[Intro: Yung Pinch]
Beach boy in this ho, oh, woah
Yeah
Look, I know you
You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Wanna fuck me 'cause them diamonds on my chain
Girl, don't you? Don't you? Yeah, oh

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Look, I know you, you just wanna fuck me for my fame
Girl, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Yeah, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
She wanna fuck me 'cause them diamonds on my chain
Girl, I know you, you be out here playin' all them games
Girl, don't you? Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know you

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Big body, she gon' swerve it, now we way above the surface
Shorty lookin' picture-perfect, say she ready, never nervous
I wanna know like it's urgent, give her good pipe when in person
You want the cars and the purses, baby girl, tell me is it worth it
I'm in a spaceship, get ready for takeoff
Can't fuck with lil' shorty, I know that she basic
She makin' my dick soft, these niggas hatin'
Said I wouldn't make it, I shine with a new floss
I got his girl in a room gettin' naked, she fuck with a real boss
When my gang walk in it's lit (It's lit), legit (Legit)
Give her the D then she dismissed (Dismissed), no kiss (No kiss)
You test me then you getting hit (Hit), lil' bitch (Lil' bitch)
I take my shot and I don't miss (Don't miss), my diamonds piss (Piss)
And girl, that's funny 'cause I know you
You just come around and make a name
Girl, I know you, gon' tell me that you different and you changed
But I know you are everything you say you ain't
You tried to take me down, I left you in the rain
(Ayy, girl I, ayy, girl I)

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Look, I know you, you just wanna fuck me for my fame
Girl, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Yeah, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
She wanna fuck me 'cause the diamonds on my chain
Girl, I know you, you be out here playin' all them games
Girl, don't you? Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know you

[Verse 2: Yung Pinch]
Look, she want the money and the fame, told her you gotta go
I ain't gon' give your ass a thing, she want a pot of gold
Back when I was young I had a lot of hoes
I'm talkin' back before I got this dough, now I see how they rockin'
I know how you roll now, ain't no need for talkin'
That shit gettin' old now, left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these goals down, left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these hoes down (Hold up, wait)
Gucci down to the socks (Ho, yeah), that's a beach boy, baby
Pull up to the party, shawty all up on me, now she wanna date me
Said she wanna have my baby
I ain't know that was your lady, oh no
I've been workin' off the clock for this shit, did a lot for this shit
Please don't expect me just to give it up
Shorty wanna rock with the kid
I gave her cock then I dipped, told lil' mama go ahead and live it up

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Look, I know you, you just wanna fuck me for my fame
Girl, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Yeah, don't you? You just wanna fuck me for the fame
She wanna fuck me 'cause the diamonds on my chain
Girl, I know you, you be out here playin' all them games
Girl, don't you? Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know you
