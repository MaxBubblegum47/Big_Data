Ba-ba-babylon girl, Ba-ba-babylon girl
From my room to the world, yeah!
Every moment that we've lived
Every tiny little thing
How am I gonna explain to myself that you won't be there, no
Cause all of my craziness is because of you, oh na...
Tell me what should I do? What should I do?
Baby I'm so sorry I let you on
It wasn't my intention
But when love is love
And it's real it can get down a nation
Cause all of my craziness is because of you, oh na
Tell me what should I do? What should I do?
Baby no (Baby no), I promise it won't be the last kiss
So hold it on (hold it on)
Keep it safe, don't forget about it
Cause baby I won't (baby i won't)
Haciéndotelo así, así, así
The way how you like it, baby
Because she's everything like walking the moonlight
Baby, I love your way
And I just don't wanna be with other lady
Cause you are the path I take
And I just wanna be with you, baby
Nena, por favor entiéndelo
Just give me your hand and trust in me
If you get lost just follow my voice
So give me some time, baby some time
Cause you and I are meant to be close for the rest of our lives
Give me some time, baby some time
Cause you and I,  cause you and I are meant to be close for the rest of our lives, baby
Baby no (Baby no), I promise it won't be the last kiss
So hold it on (hold it on)
Keep it safe, don't forget about it
Cause baby I won't (baby i won't)
Haciéndotelo así, así, así
The way how you like it, baby
Cause Baby no (Baby no), I promise it won't be the last kiss
So hold it on (hold it on)
Keep it safe, don't forget about it
Cause baby I won't (baby i won't)
Haciéndotelo así, así, así
The way how you like it, baby
Cause all of my craziness is because of you
Tell me what should I do
What should I what should I
