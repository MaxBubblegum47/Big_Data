Youre lazy just stay in bed
Youre lazy just stay in bed
You dont want no money
You dont want no bread
If youre drowning you dont clutch no straw
If youre drowning you dont clutch no straw
You dont want to live you dont want to cry no more
Well my trying ain't done no good
I said my trying ain't done no good
You dont make no effort no not like you should
Lazy you just stay in bed
Lazy you just stay in bed
You dont want no money
You dont want no bread
