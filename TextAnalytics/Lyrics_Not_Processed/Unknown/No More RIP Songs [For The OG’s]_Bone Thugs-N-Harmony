This is for the OG's, this is for the OG's/ This is for everyone back in the day, everyone who paved the way before me/ This is for the shorty's/ It's because even when I had no change, still the same, it didn't change, homie/ This is for the homies, everyone who couldn't make it here today/ Lift your lighters up and say "RIP" Lift your lighters (For me) Lift your lighters (For me) Lift your lighters (For me) Just to say "RIP"

Now, I gotta give it up for all my dogs, a lot of my niggas with they names across the wall/ Some really took a fall and lost it all, but we gon' show 'em, we gon' keep it for my nigga; We gon' ball for ya'll, roll for ya'll/Really thank God for ya'll cause I would not be here if ya'll had not paved the way for me/ We here doing our thang/ Cause way back in the day before I came of age, I watched the hustlas play/ Low key, I studied game/ I knew I'd make a name, who knew it'd come with fame/ Ya'll know the story; Bone Thugs crept, crept, and came up/ All my thugs, I salute you, stay true/ An all my love, I send to you/ This one here's for you, and you/ We still love you so you know it's all good (It's all good) Ya' alright (alright, alright)

Okay, we gone, we can breathe on/ Put your lighters in the air and make sure that his not forgotten cause the love from the heart is a wonderful start and heal up the pain when you takin' these losses/ Sick of these losses, still get naucious rememberin' one of my Bone Thug bosses/ Wish I could see you, I wish I could call you, but all I can say is you was one of the rawest/ You had to move on without us, before us/ Crack a beer an I pour it on the curb an I hope ya notice/ I'm a soldier on this planet, you a soldier up in Heaven/ As long as I live this life, Im reppin' prayin to God that we all get let it/ I'm a count my blessings and pray that these haters ain't disrespecting/ Ain't ever no questions/ If we gotta rebel and do some checkin'/ At any second, things can change an death attack/ And for the record you already know where I'll see you at

Gotta love trend setters ahead of us that did it, went to get it/ When they said we can't have none, they kept the focus, now we can toast/ Pour out some for 'em, we love 'em/ Still here among us like Russel/ Some don't like Eazy, get it out, a real word, ya' can't learn this on TV/ Believe me, it's not that way, hey/ Flossin' might make it ya last day, itchin' to get it, thugstas with no pay/ Sad song, sad sad songs/ But we relate down on our way, somethings always goin' on, wrong/ My nigga Chester (Oh, my God) took one to the chest in front of his momma's home (Yup, yup) I know this yes, I know we all gotta go, I pray I'm too soon/ If I do, I ask my thugstas; Watch over my few (Watch' em, watch 'em) If it's you, the world is ya Thugsta, I got'chu, got'chu

Bizzy Bone
My Father and Grandfather, so happy to be in existence, alive/ My understanding the meaning of reasons and plus the answers on how to survive/ How to rewind, make it to perfection at least, I'm getting as close as I can/ As y'all teach me to be a man/ I stand for something that's more grand; The rest of the fam/ Demonous the winds, Abraham brang some of the Jinn/ Timothy, so broken, and all of the candles we born into sin/ I thank the light created from darkness, the angels' just wantin' the love/ But the love that he has could never be bought and I think him and call him a dove/ Plus he love Allah, and plus the Son, and I know that he love me as well/ My name is glory, and Jesus' my dad/ Even if all of the children fail, we'll never fail/ Better be careful, the mysteries here, can't eat off the holy grail/ Angels still on your trail, you worship The Lord, you'll always prevail/ Never could teach, I tried to preach, you know what they do to me; Want to be righteous/ Instead of my stuck in the shelters, I'm kind of famous, singin' and writin'/ Grandfather, I'm feeling the hurt of the battle, the talent just like i was told/ Make me strong in the face of invisible things; Bizzy Bone can't be boned
