[Verse 1]
Well, I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes
Yeah, I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes
I ain't got no matches
But I got a long way to go

[Chorus]
I'm an ol' poor boy and a long way from home
I'm an ol' poor boy and a long way from home
Guess I'll never be happy
Everything I do is wrong, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm an ol' poor boy and a long way from home
I'm an ol' poor boy and a long way from home
Guess I'll never be happy
Everything I do is wrong, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes
Yeah, I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes
I got no matches
Got a long way to go
