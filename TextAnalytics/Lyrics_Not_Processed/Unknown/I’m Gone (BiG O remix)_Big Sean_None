Hey..

Verse:
(BiG O)

I think you somethin special
You know how it is everybody say they miss ya
A couple days later most of em just start to diss ya
So many tears and bloods
Still there's so many drugs
Gotdammn I shoulda went ahead and kissed you, a man
Kill another man lord what could'v been the issue?
Uh,these lil boys out here
Steady claimin that they fly smoked a lil weed now he claimin that he high, bad
Thoughts on my mind I just let em walk by,seen a couple things that you woulda
Never known, dad ain't seen me in a while look how much your son as grown our
Emotions get bigger but we never let it show
Our emotions get bigger but we never let it show,listen..
Uh so before I'm gone
I'll be writing and be writing
Gettin in my zone,we was cool yesterday now they want my
Phone,I'ma make it in this game put that on my stone
Yeah I'll be swimming with the sharks tryina live on the
Sea,trouble running straight to me everywhere I try to be
So I stay lowkey hopin they don't know me,couple kids on
The news hopin they don't show me,ain't worried nothin cause
I'm worried bout livin even though you ain't got it but
You worried bout giving
Even though you ain't got it but you worried bout giving
I'mma be the realest youngin out here uh,huh I'm gone
I'mma be the realest youngin out here uh huh I'm gone...
