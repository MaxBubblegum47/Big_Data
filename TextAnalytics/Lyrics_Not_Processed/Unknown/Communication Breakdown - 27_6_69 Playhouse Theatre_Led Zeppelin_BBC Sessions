[Verse 1]
Hey, girl, a-stop what you're doin'
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you that I like it a lot
Won't you let me hold you, let me feel your lovin' charms

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
Having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

[Verse 2]
Hey, girl, I got something you ought to know
Ooh, my baby, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah
I'm never gonna let you go, 'cause I like your charms

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
Having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

[Bridge]
Do do do do do do, yeah
'S I wanna do little mama babe yeah
But I don't seem to mind
I can't stop the feelin', baby
Mama, I'm givin' you a ride
Yes, yes
Oh oh
Oh yes
Oh, I don't want
Oh oh oh yeah
