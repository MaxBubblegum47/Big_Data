[Verse]
D-Town, Westside, yeah, I said it, Westside
But they yelling Big so much that you would thought it's Bed-Stuy
You are now rocking with the newest, newest best out
Go and roll that good up, 'cause I'm stressed out
I come a city where 9-11 dialled up
Everybody riled up, a hundred gun pile up
They'll lay it on the line, line, make sure you don't get filed up
Hammers in and out of court, boy, don't get trialled up

[Outro]
Yeah
