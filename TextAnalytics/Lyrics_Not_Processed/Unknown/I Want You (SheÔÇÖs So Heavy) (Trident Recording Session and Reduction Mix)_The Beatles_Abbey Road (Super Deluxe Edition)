[Intro]
She...!

[John]  It's the case of one awful one after another!
What's  it the case of, Mr. Martin?

[George Martin] Take 4 was very good up to the breakdown...

[John] Which was take 4?

[George  Martin] ...and it was very good until the end bit there when Paul did his bit that wasn't quite right

[John]  My boys are ready to go!

[Glyn Johns] John?

[John]  Yes? What?

[Glyn Johns] It is possible without affecting yourselves too much to turn down a little? Apparently there's been a complaint

[John] From who?

[Glyn Johns] From somebody outside the building

[John]  What are they doing here at this time of night?

[Ringo] It's that guy

[John] What guy?

[Ringo] The last time, he complained...

[Paul] It's his own fault for getting a house in such a lousy district!

[John] Well, we'll try it once more very loud
And if we don't get it, we'll try it quiet like you might do it the other way
Okay, the loud one, last go
Last chance to be loud!

[George Harrison] Who says?

[John] Can't quite see through these now
I just can't see them, they keep merging
One-two-three, one-two-three

[Verse]
I want you
I want you so bad, baby
I want you
I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
I want you
I want you so bad
I want you
I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
It's driving me...
I want you
I want you so bad
I want you
I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
I want you
You know I want you so bad
I want you
I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
Yeah!

[Chorus]
She's so...
