Here I stand, head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and everyday
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you got to hide your love away
Hey, you got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find away?
Gather round, all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you got to hide your love away
Hey, you got to hide your love away
