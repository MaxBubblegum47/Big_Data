[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Hook: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't have all the hood rats and mud rats
Like you ain't had 'em, good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my momma crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that’s how a soldier feels
All that killing over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi, this that Oprah feel

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My life is exciting as Dennis Rodman's (Woah)
Stars intertwine, my soul back in alignment
If we don't have the same vision, no point in exchanging contact (No)
Only ex I love running into is at the end of my contracts, yeah
Bottom line, I'm seeing through the mask of the fakes
Like we're at the Comic Con, I point 'em out from time to time
Speaking of time, me and my mom been gettin' closer
Either I took her for granted or didn't know her
Or is it, I'm getting older?
Or is it, Lucas finally turning into Yoda?
Only new beginnings, no such thing as over
We should have just stayed friends
That never opened up or needed closure (God)
Give me directions like Noah
I don't know some hopeless romantic shit
But I can't wait to see Ye get back with HOVA
Look bitch, this the new chain of command (Bitch)
Might bring the Pow chains back like me and Ye in Japan
Cudi back at it again, Push, yeah that's 'till the end, yeah
Just like it should have been
Nothing but that G.O.O.D. and the G around us
I knocked don the walls and my head free my mind up (Woah)
I didn't chase the game, ho, I helped redesign it, yeah
Goin' against us, you need logic, Muhammad
I'm so fuckin' conscious, that shit is my compass, yeah, yeah
Don

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Who really loves me? Somebody loves me (Ooh yeah)
Who really wants me? Who really cares about me?
Said I remember when you left me buy my grandma's house
Yeah, I remember when you let me buy my grannie's house
You ain't my nigga if you ain't ever been by my grandma's house (No)
This ain't real love if we never fuck on my grandma's couch (No)
Nobody loves me, can't trust nobody
Don't want no fake niggas around me, don't need nobody (Yeah)

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees
Warmin' up to me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see, I can walk on water
Made it back from shore, I can float from the water
Father, lift me up, don't let me drown

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Uh, uh, don't let me drown
Uh, uh, don't let me drown, uh, uh, uh, yeah
Okay, I've been on the road, fuckin' ever since we gotta be (Uh)
Gettin' too much cash, not to upgrade percentages and salaries
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh
All I ever wanted is someone to be genuine (Uh, uh)
And to truly show me love, gotta be high like some Seroquel
Don't take nothin' from us, I don't got time to be watchin' them
Ooh, the way she walkin' with legs, can't keep up, uh, uh
I see them watchin' me

[Chorus: Ant Clemons & Young Thug]
Seasons changing, summer starts to leave (Uh, uh)
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring (Uh, uh)
80 degrees
Warm enough for me (Uh, uh)
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see, I can walk on water
Made it back from shore, I can float from the water
Father, lift me up, don't let me drown

[Bridge: Kanye West]
See this in 3D
'Fore life start for me
'Fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
80 degrees
Warmin' up to me
I did it free
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey, I want you
I can't float on the bottom
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

[Hook: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave

I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my mom a crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that's how a soldier feels
All that killing over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi, this that Oprah field
