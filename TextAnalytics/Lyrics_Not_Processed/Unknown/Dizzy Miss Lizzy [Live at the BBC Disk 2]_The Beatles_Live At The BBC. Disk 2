[Verse 1]
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
The way you rock and roll
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When we do the stroll
Come on, Miss Lizzy
Love me before I grow too old

[Verse 2]
Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Oh girl, you look so fine
Just a-rocking and a-rolling
Girl I said I wish you were mine

[Interlude]
Aw!
Aw!
Woo!

[Verse 3]
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you call my name
Oooh baby
Say you're driving me insane
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby
I want to be your loving man


[Interlude]
Ooh
Ooh
Aw!

[Verse 4]
Run and tell your mama
I want you to be my bride
Run and tell your brother
Baby, don't run and hide
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
Girl, I want to marry you

[Verse 2]
Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine, girl
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Girl, you look so fine
You're just a-rocking and a-rolling
Oh I said I wish you were mine

[Outro]
