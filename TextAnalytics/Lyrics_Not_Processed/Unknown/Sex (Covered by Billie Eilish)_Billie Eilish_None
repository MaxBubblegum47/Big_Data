And this is how it starts
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
My shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back

And she said use your hands and my spare time
We’ve got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine
She said she's got a boyfriend anyway
She’s got a boyfriend anyway

There's only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

Now we're on the bed in my room
And I’m about to fill his shoes
But you say no, you say no
Does he take care of you?
Or could I easily fill his shoes?
But you say no, you say no

Now we’re just outside of town
And you're making your way down
She’s got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

And I'm not trying to stop you, love
It's just if we’re gonna do anything
We might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They've all got back combs anyway
They've all got boyfriends anyway
