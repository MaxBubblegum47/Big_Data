I got a certain little girl, she's on my mind
No doubt about it, she looks so fine
The best girl that I ever had
She's gonna make me feel so bad
Yeah, make me feel so bad

She's got loving like quicksand
Only took one touch of my hand
Blow my mind and I'm in so deep
Can't eat, I can't sleep, yeah
I can't sleep, yeah

Hush, hush, I thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, she took my heart
But I love her just the same now

Hush, thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush, I need her loving
But I'm not to blame now

I got her early in the morning
Late in the evening

Hush, hush, I thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, she took my heart
But I love her just the same now

Hush, thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush, I need her loving
But I'm not to blame now

I got her early in the morning
Late in the evening
