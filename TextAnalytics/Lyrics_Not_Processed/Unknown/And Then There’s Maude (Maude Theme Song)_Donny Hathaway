Lady Godiva was a freedom rider
She didn't care if the whole world looked
Joan of Arc with the Lord to guide her
She was a sister who really cooked
Isadora was the first bra-burner
Ain't ya glad she showed up? (Oh yeah!)
And when the country was fallin' apart
Betsy Ross got it all sewed up

(CHORUS):
(And then there's Maude)
And then there's Maude
(And then there's Maude)
And then there's Maude
(And then there's Maude)
And then there's Maude
(And then there's.....)

That uncompromisin', enterprisin', anything but tranquilizin'
Right on Maude!
