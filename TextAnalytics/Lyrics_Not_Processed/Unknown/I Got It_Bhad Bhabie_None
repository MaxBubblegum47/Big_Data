[Intro]
SMOKESCREEN

[Chorus]
It's really no flex,
 I got it (I got it)
Six-figure checks, I got it (I got it)
These hoes act so psychotic
Like they don't know I got it (What's wrong with you?)
50K cash, I got it (I got it)
Two-hundred on my dash, I got it (I got it, bitch)
The game on smash, I got it
My hoes won't last like I did

[Verse 1]
They wanna flex for the clout (Yuh)
Same one that's counting me out (Yuh)
You bitches just running yo' mouth
But that ain't what I'm about (Yah)
I'm running up commas in place
Still stomp a bitch out in my J's
They took me out of the streets
But I'm still stuck in my ways
Why would I care what you thots would say?
You hoes look like somebody smashed your face
Still see my face, I ain't got no cake
They showing fake, let them mask the hate
Still stuck on me like some masking tape
I'm fresh to death like I passed away
Can't stop my hustle, don't have no brakes
I'm already winning, don't have to race

[Refrain]
Talk tough, but won't do shit
I picked up like "Who this?"
They talk down, but so what
I'm bossed up, I'm so lit
I ain't got friends, I got groupies
Around me for clout, you don't fool me (You hoe)
I've been with this shit, you a newbie
Out with the old, it's a new me

[Chorus]
It's really no flex, I got it (I got it)
Six-figure checks, I got it (I got it)
These hoes act so psychotic
Like they don't know I got it (What's wrong with you?)
50K cash, I got it (I got it)
Two-hundred on my dash, I got it (I got it, bitch)
The game on smash, I got it
My hoes won't last like I did

[Interlude]
Got It (Got it, bitch)
Got It (I got it, hoe)
I got it
Got it (Yuh)
Got it
I got it

[Verse 2]
When I get on the road, I need bigger pay (Yuh)
I smell the money from miles away (Yuh)
I don't own wallets, don't need a safe
They know me by first name at BOA (Yuh)
I jump on this beat and it's DOA
Out of my struggle, I found a way
Lost a few homies along the way
But I never needed them anyways
I done lost count of my enemies
Sick and they can't find a remedy
Bitches be fake as they remy weave
I know they plotting on ending me
Dodging the shit they've been sending me (Sending me?)
Guap is the only thing sent to me
Ten-thousand is really a cent to me
Lil Baby keep eyin', she into me
But I ain't really feeling her energy

[Refrain]
Talk tough, but won't do shit
I picked up like "Who this?"
They talk down, but so what
I'm bossed up, I'm so lit
I ain't got friends, I got groupies
Around me for clout, you don't fool me
I've been with this shit, you a newbie (Weird ass hoe)
Out with the old, it's a new me

[Chorus]
It's really no flex, I got it (I got it)
Six-figure checks I got it (I got it)
These hoes act so psychotic
Like they don't know I got it (What's wrong with you?)
50K cash, I got it (I got it)
Two-hundred on my dash, I got it (I got it, bitch)
The game on smash, I got it
My hoes won't last like I did

[Outro]
Got It (Got it, bitch)
Got It (Bitch)
I got it
Got it (Yuh)
Got it
I got it (Bitch)
We gon' smash your party
