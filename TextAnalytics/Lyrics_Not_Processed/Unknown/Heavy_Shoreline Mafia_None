[Intro: Ohgeesy]
Moving weight, shit get heavy
On the road, driving steady
Smoking dope, you smoking reggie

[Chorus: Ohgeesy]
Moving weight, shit get heavy
On the road, driving steady
Smoking dope, you smoking reggie
Run off with an ounce, lil nigga I'm so petty
Moving weight, shit get heavy
On the road, driving steady
Smoking dope, you smoking reggie
Run off with an ounce, lil nigga I'm so petty

[Verse 1: Ohgeesy]
I don't sip no regular, the fuck is a clean Sprite?
You steady sippin' ones, why the fuck is your lean light?
All it take is just one call, you get the green light
She steady on my call log, I hit her with the mean pipe
Think twice, yeah, the pink nice
I can sip it straight, I don't think I need the ice
I can fuck on all them bitches, I don't think I need a wife
Why you buggin' out lil bitch, I think you need a life
Grippin' poles, at the red light
Sippin' pour, get my head right
Call your ho, I know the head right
I don't gotta count it up, I know that the bread right
Dropped an eight of that Tech, made a red Sprite
Dropped a four in a deuce, get my head light
Pulled up on a nigga, lookin' like he seen headlights
I reach for the Glock, cock it back, he a dead guy
Now I'm rollin', I'm rockin', milly rockin' off the molly
Guaranteed I plugged every nigga standin' in the party
Now I'm rollin', I'm rockin', milly rockin' off the molly
Guaranteed I plugged every nigga standin' in the party

[Chorus: Ohgeesy]
Moving weight, shit get heavy
On the road, driving steady
Smoking dope, you smoking reggie
Run off with an ounce, lil nigga I'm so petty
Moving weight, shit get heavy
On the road, driving steady
Smoking dope, you smoking reggie
Run off with an ounce, lil nigga I'm so petty

[Verse 2: Ohgeesy]
Real trap nigga, I don't fold under pressure
Niggas start talking when the feds come and get you
Baby these Raf Simons, these is not no Skechers
Wanna fuck with a nigga 'cause she know my dick better
I'm a young drug dealer, I'm a go-getter
She don't ask for nothin' 'cause the ho know better
I'm a young drug dealer, I'm a go-getter
She don't ask for nothin' 'cause the ho know better
Go and pass my double cup, I'm finna pour a refill
I was rollin' hella hard, bussin' off of three pills
I hit it with a Karo and mix it with a Zzz-quil
These niggas they not fucking with me, none of us is equal

[Outro: Ohgeesy]
Go and pass my double cup, I'm finna pour a refill
I was rollin' hella hard, bussin' off of three pills
I hit it with a Karo and mix it with a Zzz-quil
These niggas they not fucking with me, none of us is equal
I'm rollin', I'm rockin', I'm rollin', I'm rockin'
I'm rollin', I'm rockin', I'm rollin', I'm rockin'
I'm rollin', I'm rockin', I'm rollin', I'm rockin'
I'm rollin', I'm rockin', I'm rollin', I'm rockin'
