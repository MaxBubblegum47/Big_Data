Baby, won't you be my friend?
And love me right until the end?
I don't care what shape you're in
What you've done or where you've been
Yeah

I've got nothing to hide from you
We can sit and talk about the past
We don't need to tell the truth
To tell the truth now
We're all the same in the dark

Baby, won't you be my friend?
And love me right until the end?
I guess we'll never know
What happened down in Mexico

Like what I see, I like the view
We can stay as long as it lasts
There's no difference 'tween me and you
To tell the truth now
We're all the same in the dark

I don't need to see a doctor, no
I know exactly who I am
I'm just like you

Baby, won't you be my friend?
And love me right until the end?
You know that fashion come and fashion go
Melting like the summer snow

I don't know what you see in me
Some would say that we're miles apart
But when everything is said and done
And the lights go down
We're all the same, we're all the same in the dark
