[Verse 1]
Put it in the back of my mind (My mind)
I don't usually say this, but you know I might
Maybe I was wasting my time
Holding shit together so you know I try
I'm moving so slow no I thought I'd feel better
Only been a month but it's taking forever
I don't really know if I thought I'd feel better
You don't really know me so you wouldn't mind

[Chorus]
Oh, you thought you knew me like that, but you (Don't)
The middle of the summer here I am, we're still
I don't think you know me like you thought you did back then
Back then, you knew me but right now you just-
Oh, you thought you knew me like that, but you (Don't)
The middle of the summer here I am, we're still
I don't think you know me like you thought you did back then
Back then, you knew me but right now you just don't
You just don't

[Verse 2]
People change and it's got me feeling stressed out
Kind of strange that there's nothing we can talk about
That's why they say, maybe reasons that were left out
You don't really notice like I thought you did

[Chorus]
Oh, you thought you knew me like that, but you (Don't)
The middle of the summer here I am, we're still
I don't think you know me like you thought you did back then
Back then, you knew me but right now you just-
Oh, you thought you knew me like that, but you (Don't)
The middle of the summer here I am, we're still
I don't think you know me like you thought you did back then
Back then, you knew me but right now you just don't
You just don't

[Bridge]
My lover, I'm so sad
How am I gonna do?
You know when you feel silence?
I just feel silence now
So sad

[Outro]
You don't know me like I wish you would or you did last summer
Truth is I'm alone, I'm not happy, it's not hard to remember
Put it in the back of my mind
You don't miss me much
We've been out of touch lately
Maybe I was wasting my time
Guess I'm not enough in another life, maybe
