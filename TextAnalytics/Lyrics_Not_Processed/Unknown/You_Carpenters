You are the one who makes me happy
When everything else turns to grey
Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings
And sends me out into the day
You are the crowd that sits quiet listening to me
And all the mad sense I make
You are one of the few things
Worth remembering
And since it's all true
How could anyone mean more to me than you?
Sorry if sometimes I look past you
Thereâ€™s no one beyond your eyes
Inside my head the wheels are turning
And sometimes I'm not so wise
You are my heart and my soul, my inspiration
Just like the old love song goes
You are one of the few things
Worth remembering
And since it's all true
How could anyone mean more to me than you?
You are my heart and my soul, my inspiration
Just like the old love song goes
You are one of the few things
Worth remembering
And since it's all true
How could anyone mean more to me than you?
