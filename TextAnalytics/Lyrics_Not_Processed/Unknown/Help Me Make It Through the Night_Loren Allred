[Verse 1: Michael Bublé]
Take that ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Lay your head soft against your skin
Like the shadow on the wall

[Verse 2: Loren Allred]
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Bublé & Loren Allred]
I don't care who's right or wrong
I will try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend

[Chorus: Loren Allred, 
Michael Bublé
, 
Michael Bublé & Loren Allred
]
Yesterday is dead and gone
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Bublé & Loren Allred, 
Michael Bublé
, 
Loren Allred
]
I don't care who's right or wrong
I will try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
 (
Oh, tonight I need a friend
)

[Chorus: Michael Bublé, 
Loren Allred
, 
Michael Bublé & Loren Allred
]
Yesterday is dead and gone (
It's dead and gone
)
But tomorrow's out of sight (
But tomorrow's out of sight
)
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

[Outro: Loren Allred, 
Michael Bublé
, 
Michael Bublé & Loren Allred
]
I don't wanna be alone
Help me make it through the night
You don't have to be alone
I'll help you make it through the night
