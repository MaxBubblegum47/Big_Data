[Verse 1]
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Verse 2]
I'm home alone, you're God knows where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Chorus/Outro]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
