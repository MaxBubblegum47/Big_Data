[Intro: Theophilus London & Kanye West]
Nothing bout you
Nothing bout you
I wanna tell you
All day, nigga
Dance, ayy, ayy ayy ayy
All day, nigga

[Hook 1: Kanye West]
How long you niggas ball? All day, nigga
How much time you spent at the mall? All day, nigga
How many...do you got on call? All day, nigga
Swish, swish...they keep you in court? All day, nigga
Take you to get this fly? All day, nigga
Tell your P.O. how-how long you been high? All day, nigga
You already know I’m straight from the Chi, all day, nigga
South, south side! All day, nigga

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Kendrick Lamar]
This Ye, nigga
Shoppin' for the winter and it’s just May, nigga
Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga
And you ain't gettin' money 'less you got eight figures
Talkin' big face, nigga
Put yo' ass back of pocket like a switch blade, nigga, uh
I ain't tryna play, nigga
Got a middle finger longer than Dikembe, my nigga, uh
All day, nigga
'Ye in the building like a hallway, nigga
Still got the hundred with the small face, nigga
Might spend 50 racks on my off day, nigga
Might...naturally all day, nigga
If...have Allstate with you, uh
You a Rico Suave nigga
Ride 'round listen to Sade, nigga
Ride 'round something and it's all day, nigga
You an actor, you should be on Broadway, nigga
Cause you do shit the broad way, nigga
Your bitch got a ass, but my broad way thicker
...then booked it like the Barclays Center, uh

[Interlude: sample & (Kanye West)]
Nothing bout you
Nothing bout you
I wanna tell you
(All day, nigga)

[Refrain: Allan Kingdom]
I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed
I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
All day hoe, my neck look sweeter than parfait hoe
Rap Derek Jeter in a red two-seater
I can throw this dick from far away hoe (swish it, swish it)
Ask me how long do it take to be the greatest
I'm a bar away hoe (swish it, swish it)
Damn Kanye never will it be safe
Bitch I already know (swish it, swish it)
24/7 365 days everybody gettin' paid
Nigga lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJ's
Chitown, PJ all of BJ
Chitown, we play for the freebase
These days, don't believe what police say
DJ's and the B-boys run shit
Only way I can sum it up, sumbitch

[Interlude: Theophilus London & sample]
Nothing bout you
Nothing bout you
I wanna tell you
So won't you dance, ayy, ayy ayy ayy

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Little darling, let me run (let me run)
Until I find myself
In the morning sun
Give me freedom (give me freedom)
Give me space
I want to find myself
In that special place
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
