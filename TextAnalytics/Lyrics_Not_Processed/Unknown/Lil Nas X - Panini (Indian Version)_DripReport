[Intro: Nessly]
D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Verse: DripReport & Lil Nas X]
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny?
It's a dreamy, wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me?
I thought you want this for my life (Oh)
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied (Oh)
Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
