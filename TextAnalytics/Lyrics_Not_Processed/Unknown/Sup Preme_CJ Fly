[Intro]
Hi. how are you?
How are you? High
Haha

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
On the low she need it bad like my cojones
To be blunt probably go nuts
For a sack of the arboles
Packed is what our bowl is
Make me feel monumental for the moment like a stonage
I be frozen like a stream when it's coldest
Moving slowly cause I'm eating ganja goldfish
Reincarnated soul within
Coma it’s in, oh since whenever
I’m with an O since when
We men value pussy, so as players we supposed to win
Ain't talkative but give me so much lip
Aim to give her your arroz and she's bowlegged
Say it's time to meet your maker have her boated in
Some need a hulk to leave a ghost and then some lokes will spread

Wasn't sticking to the script like clothes and lint
Catch your feelings on camera like a motion pics
I run all the shows with the flows I kick
Automatically, atomically, you're rusty quick
Should have known this is it
Because how I was raised, I'm commonly decent
I'm someone you look down upon that's probably dissent

[Hook: CJ Fly]
I meant oh, what can I say, I mean um
I just don't know, I just don't know, I just don't know, I just don't know
I meant oh, what can I say, I mean um
What can I say, what can I say, what can I say, what can I say?
I meant oh, what can I say, I mean um
Swear I don't know, swear I don't know, swear I don't know, swear I don't know

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
What can I say other than I'm filling them J's
I got five on the floor like minimum wage
Punchlines hit'em low like a MMA fighter
My blunt smell lemonade inside it
I got that bomb-ass like grenades got fired
Fuck a job app. bitch, I'd rather get higher
A-SAP, I got that work in my spliff
Its 2:47 and its time to make a shift
Cruise through Flatbush way, so swift
Bed-Stuy drives make me flashback quick
Sometimes I just think, reminisce 'tll I receive
Electricity resonance
I know some evil residents under sediments
Root of all evil, dead presidents
Spit venomous, make moves over the net
Make my landlord wonder where his tenants went
I just dont know

[Hook: CJ Fly]
I meant oh, what can I say, I mean um
I just don't know, I just don't know, I just don't know, I just don't know
I meant oh, what can I say, I mean um
What can I say, what can I say, what can I say, what can I say?
I meant oh, what can I say, I mean um
Swear I don't know, swear I don't know, swear I don't know, swear I don't know
