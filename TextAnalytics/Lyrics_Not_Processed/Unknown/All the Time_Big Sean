[Chorus: Kanye West]
She's like that all the time
I always get on when she's on
She's like that all the time
I tell her she's right when she's wrong
Anything for a quiet night
'Cause she's always keeping it going
She's like that all the time
But I'll never leave her alone

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Oh
Man, this one for my old girl that stayed down
Even though I've been gone, she hold me down like I stay 'round (Right)
Been had her a new man but she still gon' come lay down (Oh God)
And bust it all night like a motherfucking Greyhound
And I know that you spend night after night
Sippin' liquor on liquor
Rolling with women on women
What's that? Bump bad bitches
But girl, you finer than your fine friends (Ooh)
Every time I bump into ya, I'm like, "Where the fuck the time went?"
I skrt skrt, then you climb in
And we catch up, yessir (Yeah)
I feel that dresser (Oh God)
And we talk about everything
Except who we dating, that ain't nece-
Necessary (Woah), fuck the life, she my secretary (Wow)
Ass and face is hereditary
Her mama, shit, legendary

[Chorus: Kanye West & 
Big Sean
]
She's like that all the time
I always get on when she's on
She's like that all the time
I tell her she's right when she's wrong
Anything for a quiet night
'Cause she's always keeping it going
She's like that all the time
But I'll never leave her alone
Oh God, ooh

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
You got that hair long, I like that shit (Woah)
Titties hanging out, I like that shit (Woah)
Drama, I don't invite that shit
Text back, we really don't write that shit
Girl, I know you got options
You used to flying to islands (Go)
Dining Italian, what probably shopping with stylists
Stylists should just dress you naked
Shit, that's the best outfit (God)
Red light special but red light don't mean stopping
While we save sexy, lay texy
Rub or stretch me, caress me
Oh, good weed, no stress eat
I swear them times is the bestie
Girl, hell yeah
I feel like everybody got somebody like that
But no matter who you with, you still one night that
And no matter where you at, you just go right back
Right-right-right-right back

[Chorus: Kanye West with 
Big Sean
]
She's like that all the time
I always get on when she's on
She's like that all the time
I tell her she's right when she's wrong
Anything for a quiet night
'Cause she's always keeping it going
She's like that all the time
But I'll never leave her alone

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Man it's crazy when you love someone you hate
And hate someone you love
But then just love someone you love
And you'll do anything for
And you don't even know, relationship
And all that hating shit, and all that complicated shit
And everything is just great 'cause you know girls get crazy
Crazy what? Like Jamaican or what?
Crazy like fucking Satan or what?
Crazy like the asylum, asylum, Salem
I don't know what I'm saying
I don't-I don't know what I'm saying
I don't-I don't know what I'm saying, man
