[Intro: Big Shaq]
Yo, Big Shaq, the one and only
Man's not hot, never hot
Skrrat (GottiOnEm), skidi-kat-kat
Boom

[Verse 1: Big Shaq]
Two plus two is four
Minus one that's three, quick maths
Everyday man's on the block
Smoke trees (ah)
See your girl in the park
That girl is a uckers
When the ting went quack-quack-quack
You man were ducking (you man ducked)
Hold tight, Asznee (my brudda)
He's got the pumpy (big ting)
Hold tight, my man (my guy)
He's got the frisbee (shew)
I trap, trap, trap on the phone
Movin' that cornflakes
Rice Krispies
Hold tight, my girl Whitney (my G)
On, on, on, on, on the road doin' ten toes
Like my toes (like my toes)
You man thought I froze
I see a peng girl, then I pose (chilin')
If she ain't on it, I ghost
Hah, look at your nose (check your nose, fam)
You donut
Nose long like garden hose

[Chorus: Big Shaq]
I tell her man's not hot
I tell her man's not hot
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Say that man's not hot (not hot)
When I pull up [?] gunshot (gunshot)
Grrrrra-ka-ka-ka-ka-boom
Bi-di-bi-di-bing, poom-poom, bang, pop-pop-pop (hold that)
You see your bitch look hot and stressed (hey, hey)
Portable fan up underneath her dress (hey, hey)
Oracle man, you know a nigga blessed (hey, hey)
Horrible, damn, I leave it in a mess
Big gun cock (gun cock)
Bend down and I reach up in my sock (why you do that?)
Partridge Family, bullets is under the cartridge
Then I get to loadin' on the Glock (boom)
Shots fly, hit you in the leg
Travel to your head, bullet end up in your back (end in your back)
Trust me, you don't want no problem
With the mandem when the mandem on your block

[Refrain: Big Shaq]
The ting goes skrrrahh (ah)
Pap, pap, ka-ka-ka (ka)
Skidiki-pap-pap (pap)
And a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom (boom)
Skya (ah)
Du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun (dun)
Poom, poom
You don' know

[Chorus: Big Shaq]
I tell her man's not hot (man's not)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot"

[Bridge: Big Shaq]
Man can never be hot (never hot)
Perspiration ting (spray dat)
Lynx Effect (come on)
You didn't hear me, did you? (nah)
Use roll-on (use that)
Or spray (shhh)
But either way, A-B-C-D (alphabet ting)

[Refrain: Big Shaq]
The ting goes skrrrahh (ah)
Pap, pap, ka-ka-ka (ka)
Skidiki-pap-pap (pap)
And a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom (boom)
Skya (ah)
Du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun (dun)
Poom, poom
You don' know

[Outro: Big Shaq]
Big Shaq
Man's not hot
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
40 degrees and man's not hot (come on)
Yo, in the sauna
Man's not hot (never hot)
Yeah, skidika-pap-pap
