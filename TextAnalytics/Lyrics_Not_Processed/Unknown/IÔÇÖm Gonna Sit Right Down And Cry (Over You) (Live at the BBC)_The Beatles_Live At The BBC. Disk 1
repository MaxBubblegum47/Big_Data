[Verse]
Yeah
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you

I'm going to love you more and more every day
I'm going to love you more and more every day
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you

[Pre-Chorus]
Going to tell your mama
Tell your papa, too
So they'll know exactly
Just what I'm going to do

[Chorus]
If you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm going to sit right down and cry over you

Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
