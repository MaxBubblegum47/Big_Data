I need a fix cause' I'm going down
Back to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause' I'm going down

Mother Superior jumped-
Oh shit, wrong chord...
Okay

I need a fix cause' I'm going down
Back to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause' I'm going down

Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun

Yoko Ono, oh no
Yoko Ono, oh yes

I need a fix cause' I'm going down
Back to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause' I'm going down

Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
