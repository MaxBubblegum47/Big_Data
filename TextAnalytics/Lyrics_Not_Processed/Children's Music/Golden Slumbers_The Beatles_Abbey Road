[Verse 1]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry

[Outro]
And I will sing a lullaby
