[Verse]
Got a problem with the Golf?
 Fuck it, then pick a spot
Like you're eating lunch and it's brunch, we could bring the beef
And the pots and the pans, fuck it we could bring a lot
I just want to know if you can come and suck a dick or not?
Hit her up, pick her up in the front seat of my two seater vehicle
Hit the crib, grab the cuffs, take pictures of her butt
Where's your mouth open up?
I just want to know if you can come and suck a dick or what
The fuck am I yapping about? It don't matter
I'm the one, hun, T is the sun and you're Saturn
Better stop with all of the chit chatter, bitch I'm the tongue
I go dumblike the mental handicaps in the house
Y'all kiss butt like a nap on the couch
T the shit, I'm the weird little BLAH in your mouth
You better brush like Hova shoulder
Told you boys it never stop
I just want to know if you gon' come and suck a dick or not?
Pink and yellow in the fit, yeah
Ballin' now shit I wonder how I got here
Thanks to everyone whoever gave a fuck, yeah
A lot of niggas don’t know because I am, yeah
They told me to sit down, shit, I hate chairs
Fuck that instead I stood on their table
Flog Gnaw carnival, fuck ya' state fair
If you fuck with the Golf Boys nigga say yeah

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with the Golf Boys nigga say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Y'all niggas ain't fuckin' with T, man
Golf boys y'all ain't fuckin with me, man
Golf boys sorta like Stevie Wonder, niggas can’t see me

Gotta say shit nigga fuck you and that's it nigga
