One fine day in early spring, I played a funny trick
Right in the yard behind our house, I planted a lollipop stick
And everyday I watered it well and watched it carefully
I hoped one day that stick would grow to be a lollipop tree

Ha, ha, ha
Ho, ho, ho
Oh what a sight to see
In my lollipop, lollipop, lolli, lolli, lollipop tree

Chorus:
Ha, ha, ha
Ho, ho, ho
What a sight to see
Me and my lollipop, lollipop, lolli, lolli, lollipop tree

Then one day I woke to find a very lovely sight
A tree all full of lollipops had grown in the dark of the night
I sat beneath that wonderful tree and looked up with a grin
And when I opened up my mouth a pop would drop right in

Ha, ha, ha
Ho, ho, ho
What a place to be
Under the lollipop, lollipop, lolli, lolli, lollipop tree

(chorus)
Winter came and days grew cold as winter days will do
On my tree, my lovely tree, not one little lollipop grew
From every branch an icicle hung, the twigs were bare as bones
But when I broke the icicles off, they turned to ice cream cones

Ha, ha, ha
Ho, ho, ho
How my eyes could believe
Under the lollipop, lollipop, lolli, lolli, lollipop tree

Ha, ha, ha
Ho, ho, ho
What a sight to see
Me and my lollipop, lollipop, lollipop, lollipop, tree!
