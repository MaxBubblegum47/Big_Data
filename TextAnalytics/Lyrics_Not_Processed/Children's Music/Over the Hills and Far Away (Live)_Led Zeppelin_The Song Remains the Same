Hey, lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh, darlin', darlin', darlin', walk a while with me
Oh, you got so much, I really need so much, I have to have so much

Many times I've lied and many times I've listened
Many times I've gazed along the open road
Many times I've lied and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold
Some Acapulco gold, every time

[Guitar Solo]

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missin'
Many, many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessin'
A-guessin' 'bout a thing you really oughta know
You really oughta know, hoh
Ohhhhh, sure nuff
You know it's sure nuff
