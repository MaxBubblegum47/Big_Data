Chorus:
When you walk the streets you'll have no cares
If you walk the lines and not the squares
As you go through life make this your goal
Watch the donut, not the hole
It's written on the rainbow
In letters made of gold
Written on the rainbow
There's wisdom to behold
My friends the little sparrow
Flew close enough to see
Written on the rainbow
Is this philosophy
(chorus)
It's written on the rainbow
In letters made of gold
Written on the rainbow
There's wisdom to behold
My friend the little sparrow
Agrees it must be so
Little angels wrote it
So folks on earth would know
(chorus)
(instrumental)
(chorus)
Watch the donut, not the hole
I'm off to jolly England
Where bulldogs all wear pants
Off to Pango Pango
Where alligators dance
My friend the little sparrow
Will take me when he flies
Even to the rainbow
To read with my own eyes
(chorus)
It's written on the rainbow
In letters made of gold
Written on the rainbow
There's wisdom to behold
My friend the little sparrow
Flew close enough to see
Written on the rainbow
Is this philosophy
(chorus)
Watch the donut, not the hole!
