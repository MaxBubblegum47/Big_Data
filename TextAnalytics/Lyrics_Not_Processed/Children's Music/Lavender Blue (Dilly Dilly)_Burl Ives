Lavender blue, dilly, dilly
Lavender green
If I were king, dilly, dilly
I'd need a queen
Who told me so? Dilly, dilly
Who told me so?
I told myself, dilly, dilly
I told me so
If your dilly, dilly heart
Feels a dilly, dilly way
And if you'll answer, "Yes"
In a pretty little church
On a dilly, dilly day
You'll be wed in a dilly, dilly dress of
Lavender blue, dilly, dilly
Lavender green
Then I'll be king, dilly, dilly
And you'll be my queen
Lavender blue, dilly, dilly
Lavender green
If you were king, dilly, dilly
You'd need a queen
Who told me so? Dilly, dilly
Who told me so?
I told myself, dilly, dilly
I told me so
If your dilly, dilly heart
Feels a dilly, dilly way
And if you'll answer, "Yes"
In a pretty little church
On a dilly, dilly day
I'll be wed in a dilly, dilly dress of
Lavender blue, dilly, dilly
Lavender green
Then you'll be king, dilly, dilly
And I'll be your queen
