[Verse 1]
Oh child, will you ever get by?
Will you listen to things I say?
Will you know the difference from your wrong or right?
Will you learn it along the way?
Oh child, will you drink in the night?
Will you make all the same mistakes?
Will you get around with chasing all the highs
To forget all your lowest days?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't pretend that I haven't had my regrets
From the memories that I've kept, to the history I forget
Yeah, my father before he left
Oh, there's one thing I wish he sai-ai-aid
"Oh child, just do what you love, 'cause you won't get this life again"

[Chorus]
Oh child, oh child, no, no, don't you worry
Oh child, oh child, I know you'll be okay
Oh child, oh child, no you won't get this life again
Oh child, oh child

[Verse 2]
Oh child, will you travel the world?
And see all of the things I missed?
You can tell me all about it when you're back
Like I always did
Oh child, maybe you can find love with a husband, or a wife
If you're happy when the road is getting rough
I'll be happy there by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't pretend that I haven't had my regrets
From the memories that I've kept, to the history I forget
Oh, my father before he left
Oh, there's one thing I wish he said
"Oh child, just do what you love, 'cause you won't get this life again"
No, you won't get this life again
No, you won't get this life again

[Chorus]
Oh child, oh child
Oh child, oh child
Oh child, oh child, no, no, don't you worry
Oh child, oh child, I know you'll be okay

[Post-Chorus]
Oh child, oh child
Oh child, oh child

[Verse 3]
Oh child, will you know this song
When I'm gonna fade away?
Will you sing it back
And know it word for word
Back to your child one day?
No, no, don't you worry

[Chorus]
Oh child, oh child, no, no, don't you worry
Oh child, oh child, I know you'll be okay
Oh child, oh child, no you won't get this life again
Oh child, oh child
Oh child, oh child, no you won't get this life again
