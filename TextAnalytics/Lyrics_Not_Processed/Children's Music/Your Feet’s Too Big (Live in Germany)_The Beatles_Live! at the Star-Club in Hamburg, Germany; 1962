[Intro: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
Your feet's too big
(Your feet's too fat!)
Who's that walkin' around?
Go sit, sounds like baby patter to me
[?]

[Verse 1]
Say, up in Harlem at a table for two
There were four of us: me, your big feet, and you
From your ankle up, I'll say you sure are sweet
From there down there's just too much feet

[Chorus]
Yes, your feet's too big
Don't want you 'cause you feet's too big
Can't use you 'cause you feet's too big
I really hate you 'cause your feet's too big

[Verse 2]
Where'd you get 'em?
Your girl she likes you, she thinks you're nice
Got what it takes to be in paradise
She said likes your face, she likes your array
Man, oh man, them things are too big

[Chorus]
Oh, your feet's too big
Don't want you 'cause you feet's too big
Mad at you 'cause your feet's too big
I hate you 'cause your feet's too big

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh your pedal extremities are colossal
To me, you look like a fossil
You got me walkin', talkin' and squawkin'
'Cause your feet are much too big, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, your feet's too big
Don't want you 'cause you feet's too big
Mad at you 'cause your feet's too big
I hate you 'cause your feet's too big
Oh, your feet's too big
Don't want you 'cause you feet's too big
Mad at you 'cause your feet's too big
I hate you 'cause your feet's too big

[Outro]
