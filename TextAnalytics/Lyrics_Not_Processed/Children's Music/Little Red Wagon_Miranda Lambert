[Verse 1]
You only love me for my big sunglasses
And my Tony Lamas
And my Dodge Dart Classic
You said "I'll be Johnny and you'll be June
I'll ride with you to the moon"
But guess what?

[Chorus]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Oh, heaven help me
I been sowwin' wildflower seeds
And chasin' tumbleweeds
But that's just who I be
And you're just tryin' to slow this rolling stone
But I'm on to you babe
So guess what?

[Chorus]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh

[Bridge]
Oh, you only love me for my big sunglasses and my Tony Lamas
I live in Oklahoma
And I've got long, blonde hair
And I play guitar and I go on the road
And I do all the shit you wanna do
And my dog does tricks
And I ain't about drama y'all
I love my apron
But I ain't your momma
So guess what?
What?!

[Chorus]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh
Ohhhh
Ahh
