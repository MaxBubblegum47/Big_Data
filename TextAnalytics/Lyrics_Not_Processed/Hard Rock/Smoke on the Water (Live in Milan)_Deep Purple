We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile film
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water, you got it man

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
He was pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water, you got it babe
Burning down

Hey, what you got, Stevie?

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
The Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We made a place to sweat, come on baby
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
And fire - "I can't hear you, come on now!"

(Smoke on the water)
Fire in the sky
"Alright now, come on"
(Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky)
"I still can't hear you, come on!"
(Smoke on the water)
A fire in the sky
One more time!
(Smoke on the water)

"Unbelievable, you are fantastic!
Superb, magnificent!
Thank you, you've been great, we love you!
Take it easy, bye bye!"
