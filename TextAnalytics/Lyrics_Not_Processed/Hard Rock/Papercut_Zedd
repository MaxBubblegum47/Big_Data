[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Now we're staring at the ceiling, you're so pretty when you're mad
All that I can hear is breathing, oh, oh
And we're stuck inside the silence, in a cold, cold war
We're too proud to say we're sorry, oh, oh

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
I find refuge in the distance, even when we're breaking down
Can we pause it just for one kiss? Oh, oh
Cause I never meant to hurt you, and I know you feel the same
Still the only one I run to, oh, oh

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut
