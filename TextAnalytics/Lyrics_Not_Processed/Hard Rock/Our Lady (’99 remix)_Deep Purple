Thinking out of line just to make the sun shine
Anyway, I can be like you
Fighting with the truth
Trying to hide a fool in a fantasy
I'm dreaming, lay me down and take me now
Our lady of the skies
Hiding in the sun like a loaded gun reality
Aiming high at my dream
But I can get along
She makes me strong, anyway
I'm dreaming and there is no other way
Our lady of the skies
Flying in the sky with a bunch of high fidelity
I can hear your song
Offer me a ring just to show me your sincerity
I'm dreaming, let me go
Our lady of the skies
