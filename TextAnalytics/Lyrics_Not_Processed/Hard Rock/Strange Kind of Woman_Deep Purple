[Verse 1]
There once was a woman
A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery
I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said, "I ain't for taking, won't you ever learn?"

[Chorus]
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman

[Verse 2]
She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy, you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better, she said
"Saturday nights from now on baby, you're my star"
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman
She's my soul, I love you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She finally said she loved me
I wed her in a hurry
No more callers and I glowed with pride

I'm dreaming
I feel like screaming
I won my woman just before she died

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Who do you think you are?
Superstar
Who do you think you are?
Superstar
Superstar
Who do we think we are?
Oh my soul, I love you baby
