[Verse 1]
I know that it's evil
I know that it's got to be
No, I ain't doing much
Doing nothing means a lot to me
Living on a shoestring
A fifty cent millionaire
Open to charity
Rock 'n' roller welfare
Sittin' in my Cadillac
Listenin' to my radio
Suzie, baby, get on in
Tell me where she want to go
I'm living in a nightmare
She's looking like a wet dream
I got myself a Cadillac
But I can't afford the gasoline

[Chorus]
I got holes in my shoe
And I'm way overdue
Down payment blues

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Get myself a steady job
Some responsibility
Can't even feed my cat
On social security
Hidin' from the rent man
Oh, it make me want to cry
Sheriff knockin' on my door
Ain't it funny how the time fly?
Sittin' on my sailin' boat
Sippin' on my champagne
Suzie, baby, all at sea
Say she want to come again
Feelin' like a paper cup
Floatin' down the storm drain
Got myself a sailin' boat
But I can't afford a drop of rain

[Chorus]
I got holes in my shoes
And I'm way overdue
Down payment blues
Down payment blues
Down payment blues
Down payment blues
I got holes in my shoe
And I'm way overdue
I got the down payment blues
