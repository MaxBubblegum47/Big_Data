[Verse 1]
There was a friend of mine on murder
And the judge's gavel fell
Jury found him guilty
Gave him sixteen years in hell
He said "I ain't spending my life here
I ain't livin' alone
Ain't breakin' no rocks on the chain gang
I'm breakin' out and heading home"
Gonna make a (jailbreak)
And I'm looking towards the sky
I'm gonna make a (jailbreak)
Oh, how I wish that I could fly

[Pre-Chorus]
All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
Got to be free

[Chorus]
(Jailbreak), let me outta here
(Jailbreak), sixteen years
(Jailbreak), had more than I can take
(Jailbreak)

[Verse 2]
He said he'd seen his lady being fooled with
By another man
She was down and he was up
Had a gun in his hand
Bullets started flying everywhere
People start to scream
Big man lyin' on the ground
With a hole in his body
Where his life had been

[Pre-Chorus]
But it was all in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
I got to be free

[Chorus]
(Jailbreak)
(Jailbreak)
I got to break out
Out of here

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Heartbeats, they were racing
Freedom, he was chasin'
Spotlights,
 
sirens
Rifles firing
But he made it out...
... with a bullet in his back

[Chorus]
Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak
Jailbreak, jailbreak
