[Verse 1]
Good Golly, said little Miss Molly
When she was rockin' in the house of blue light
Tutti frutti was oh, so rooty
When she was rockin' to the east and west
Lucille was oh, so real
When she didn't do her daddy's will
Come on baby, drive me crazy, do it, do it

[Chorus]
I'm a speed king, you got to hear me sing, yeah
I'm a speed king, see me fly

[Verse 2]
Saturday night and I just got paid
Gonna fool about, ain't gonna save
Some people gonna rock, some people gonna roll
Gonna have a party to save my soul
Hard-headed woman and a soft-hearted man
They been causing trouble since it all began
Take a little rice, take a little beans
Gonna rock and roll down to New Orleans

[Chorus]
I'm a speed king, you go to hear me sing
I'm a speed king, see me fly

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Good Golly, said little Miss Molly
When she was rockin' in the house of blue light
Tutti frutti was oh, so rooty
When you rockin' to the east and west
Some people gonna rock, some people gonna roll
Gonna have a party to save my soul
Come on baby, drive me crazy, do it, do it

[Chorus]
I'm a speed king, you go to hear me sing, yeah
Yeah, I'm a speed king, see me fly
I'm a speed king, you go to hear me sing
Yeah, I'm a speed king, see me
I'm a speed king, you go to hear me sing
I'm a speed king, see me
