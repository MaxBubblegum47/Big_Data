[Intro: JAY-Z]
Uh, turn, what goes around comes around
Ayy, turn, turn the music up, uh, yeah
Goes around comes around
What goes, alright, like like
Life goes in cycles
Everything that comes around goes around
'Fore it goes down, get you some ice

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Life goes in cycles, what comes around goes around
So ’fore it goes down, nigga, get you some icicles
Audemars before all of y'alls
Wristwatch got a Russian face like an oligarch, uh
12 o'clock, boy, silly nice, huh
Willie in traffic, I’m Philly nice, uh
E.T. on the handles, uh
Handlebars like a Xanax
Shammgod with the AND1 moves
Throw that shit 'round your neck
Right quick, broke boys get fixed
Right quick, Nigel Sylvester with these bike flips
Uh, that's a full cab and a back flip
Uh, sidebar

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Arm stretch a tee like I nailed it
Raf movin' slow like a creep
Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailin'
And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)
When’s the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn’t get from nobody else, yeah?
I couldn't get from nobody out there (I can’t)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
Nobody

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin’ with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin'… got…

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo
Maybe the four wheel excitin' us mo'
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel, at the table, I'm givin' a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it
Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
I'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads (Obstacles)
I'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod
Savage, I'm bikin', yeah

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
From Coldwater to the Shaw
Alcoholic way I handle the bars
This a PK, PK Ripper
Nah, you can't fuck with the boy
That's my problem, yeah, I got 'em
My tire smokin' when I stop
Okay, nobody fuckin' with me
My accolades hang from my neck
Pedal, I drown in the heat
My sapphires drown in my sweat
White mags, but I jet
Jackson, I'm savin' the streets
I'm Roger Rabbit in the air
I don't care, Big Willie Style, yeah
Nigga one wheel, one wheel, one wheel
Nigga one wheel, I fishtail downhill, yeah
I rose my rate, brand new brakes
Why I name it Slater? Ask my date

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin' with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin'

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Got, got me fucked up
Got a million dollar bike
Got a million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got a million dollar bike
Got a million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
