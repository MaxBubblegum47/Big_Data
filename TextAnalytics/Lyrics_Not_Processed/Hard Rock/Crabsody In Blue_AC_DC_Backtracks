[Verse 1]
Well, they moved on down
And they crawled around

[Chorus]
Walkin' sideways
Side-way walkin'
Give me the blues

[Verse 2]
And you start to scratch
When they start to hatch

[Chorus]
Walkin' sideways
Side-way walkin'
Give me the blues

[Bridge]
Ooh, but when they start to bite
Then it's time you saw the light
For an appointment
I know
Before you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment

Mulligan

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, the doctor said
"We got to make 'em dead"

[Chorus]
Walkin' sideways
Side-way walkin'
Give me the blues
And when you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment
And when they start to itch
You go out and you take the bitch
For an appointment

[Verse 4]
Well you rub it on
And you rub it in

[Chorus]
Stops 'em walkin'
Side-way walkin'
Gives them the blues
Side-way walkin'
Side-way walkin'
They've got the blues
Give them the blues
They got the blues
Give them the blues
