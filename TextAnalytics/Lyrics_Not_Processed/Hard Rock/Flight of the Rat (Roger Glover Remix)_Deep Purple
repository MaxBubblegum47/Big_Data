Spread the word around
The rat is leaving town
Message is a song
The misery is gone
Yes it is
Once I had a dream
To sing before the queen
She didn't want to know
She wouldn't see the show
What a fright
I couldn't do it right
Oh, what a night
What a night
Mystic demons fly
All above the sky
Memories of a clown
The saddest show in town, yeah
When I was seventeen
My mother said to me
Careful what you touch
Shouldn't touch too much
I blew my mind
She was so kind
I could have cried
In my mind I had to find
A kind of new way
Of being, oh, so cool
Like a blue blooded
Well studded English fool
Speak about the past
Times are changing fast
Once I was so weak
I couldn't even speak
Not a word
Shaking out a curse
Nothing could be worse
Walking through the door
Who could ask for more
Now I'm free
And I can see
That I am me
Yes I am me
Spread the word around
The rat is leaving town
Message is a song
The misery is gone
Shaking out a curse
Nothing could be worse
Walking through the door
Who could ask for more
Now I'm free
And I can see
That I am me
Yes I am me
Please stay away
