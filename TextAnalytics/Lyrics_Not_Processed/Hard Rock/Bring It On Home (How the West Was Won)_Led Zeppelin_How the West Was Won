Ba-by, whoa-mm, ba-by
Gonna bring it on home to you
I've bought my ticket, I've got that load
Up, we're goin' higher, all aboard
Take my seat, a-right way back, Lord
A-watch this train goin' down the track
Gonna bring it on home
Bring it on home to you

[Verse 2]
A-try to tell you baby
What you tryin' to do
Try to love me baby
Love some other man too
Bring it on home, bring it on home

Sweetest little baby daddy ever saw
I'm gonna keep you lovin' baby

Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home, bring it on home, babe

Bring it on home, a-bring it on home
A-bring it back home, A-bring it back home to me, babe
