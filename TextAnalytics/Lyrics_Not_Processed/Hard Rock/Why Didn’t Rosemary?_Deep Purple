[Verse 1]
There's a black hill, we had to climb
Everything I need but nothing's mine
Satan's world, how 'bout a kill
Why didn't Rosemary ever take the pill?
Laying there waiting, waiting for the kill
Oh, man won't do it but the devil will

[Verse 2]
I'm losing time and my mind
Why can't I have what's naturally mine?
I got life and the thing that goes with it
If there's something else, where can i get it?
Laying there waiting, waiting for the kill
Oh, man won't do it but the devil will

[Verse 3]
Well here's my views, I always lose
Things I want to do are yesterday's news
Say life's a ball, I've had it all
All out there in another dance hall
Laying there waiting, waiting for the kill
Oh, man won't do it but the devil will

[Verse 4]
Take me as I am, excuse for a man
Wherever I push someone stops my hand
As a matter of interest, tell me if you will
Why didn't Rosemary ever take the pill?
Laying there waiting, waiting for the kill
Oh, man won't do it but the devil will

[Outro]
Oh, why won't Rosemary ever take the pill?
Oh no...
Why didn't Rosemary ever take the pill the first day?
Oh, lying there waiting, waiting for the kill
I said, " Why didn't Rosemary ever take the pill?"
