[Verse 1]
Ah, you're the one I've waited for
I need your love more and more
I don't know what your name is
I don't know what your game is
I want to take you tonight
Animal appetite

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a love hungry man
Yeah I'm a love hungry man

[Verse 2]
Don't want no conversation
I need sweet sensation
And all I want to do
Is make a meal out of you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a love hungry man, oh yes I am
I got to get what I can
Yeah I'm a love hungry man
I'm tellin' you
Yes I am

[Verse 3]
Whoa I'm your love hungry man
Oh baby you're such a treat
(Love hungry man)
And you know, a man's got to eat
(I'm a love hungry man) You're the one I've waited for
Oh yes you are
(I'm a love hungry man) I need your lovin' more and more
Yeah I do

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a love hungry man
I got to get what I can
Yeah I'm a love hungry man
I'm tellin' you
Yes I am

'Cause I'm a love hungry man
I got to get what I can
Yeah I'm a love hungry man
I'm tellin' you
Yes I am

'Cause I'm a love hungry man
I got to get what I can
Yeah I'm a love hungry man
I'm tellin' you
Yes I am

[Outro]
And gimme one for the road and I’ll carry your load, I’m your man
Yes I am
Your man's got to eat, baby, bon appetite
I’m your
Love hungry man
