[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sweet child, in time, you'll see the line
The line that's drawn between good and bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying taking toll

If you've been bad, oh Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes (Ooohhhh)
You'd better bow your head
Wait for the ricochet

[Bridge]
Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh

Uhhh-uhh
Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh
Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh

Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ah-ah

I wanna hear you screaming

Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ah-ah

Aaah-aaah-aaah

Sweet child, in time, you'll see the line
