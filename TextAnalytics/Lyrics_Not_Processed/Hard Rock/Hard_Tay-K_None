[Intro: Tay-K & BlocBoy JB]
Gang, gang (bitch)
Five times seven bullets rip you apart
Beep, beep
Gang, gang, gang
You know how the fuck we rockin' man (know how the fuck we rock bitch)
Free Santana, man, free J Roc, free Sticky
Free Pimpyz, man (free Pimpyz, bitch)
Free Tay-K
Gang

[Chorus: Tay-K]
You-you-you was on some opp shit
I was cruisin' down a nigga block with the chopstick (grraa, grraa)
Rockstar nigga, (gang) now I need a rock bitch (beep)
We want beef, not veggies, not squash, bitch
That-that-that boy like to talk (gang), we pop out with mops (graa)
You gon' shoot a little, (beep, beep) we gon' shoot a lot
I rock out with the chop, bitch, I rock very hard (very hard)
She thought it was my cock but my Glock very hard

[Verse 1: Tay-K]
School was very hard (gang), bitch, I'm very hard (gang)
Tay-K very hard (hard), Tay-K fairly odd
Chop-chop-chopper with a blade, 'cause my bitch goth (bitch)
1911, Ma I'll leave you with a scar
My mama so hard (gang), my daddy go hard (gang)
Tay-K fairly odd, Tay-K very hard (bitch)
This thooka is my wand, Tay-K fairly odd
Chopper with a blade, it's gon' rip you apart
You's a monkey nigga, so we knock your tree apart (bitch)
Bullets aim far, bullets aim far

[Refrain: Tay-K & BlocBoy JB]
Tay-K very hard, Tay-K very hard (yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I'm very hard (hard), bitch, I'm very hard (that's on my mama)

[Verse 2: BlocBoy JB]
Rock like a guitar ('tar)
Draw down on a opp (huh), while he smokin' in his car (car)
We gon' smoke 'em like a 'gar ('gar)
.9 and a TEC (TEC), leave a nigga wet (wet)
Smokin' so much gas (gas, gas, gas), I think that I can fuel a jet
You niggas are nothin' but some workers (workers)
Internet lurkers (lurkers), searchers (searchers)
Stay up out my circle (my circle)
He talk down on internet, hurt him
Murk him (hurt), dirt him (hurt)
White tee, picture on a shirt him
Careful with an opp bitch
AR-15 and that ho come with a stock, bitch (stock, bitch)
Bloc Nation, nigga (nigga), so I need a Block bitch (Block bitch)
He was talkin' trash, put his ass in the garbage (garbage)

[Chorus: Tay-K]
You-you-you was on some opp shit
I was cruisin' down a nigga block with the chopstick (graa, graa)
Rockstar nigga, (gang) now I need a rock bitch (beep)
We want beef, not veggies, not squash, bitch
That-that-that boy like to talk (gang), we pop out with mops (graa)
You gon' shoot a little, (beep, beep) we gon' shoot a lot
I rock out with the chop, bitch, I rock very hard (very hard)
She thought it was my cock but my Glock very hard

[Refrain: Tay-K]
Tay-K very hard, Tay-K very hard
Bitch, I'm very hard, bitch, I'm very hard
