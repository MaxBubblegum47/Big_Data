[Verse 1]
Well we had a lot of luck on Venus
We always had a ball on Mars
We meet with all the groovy people
We rocked the Milky Way so far

[Pre-Chorus]
We danced around with Borealis
We're space truckin' 'round the stars

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

[Verse 2]
Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way?
We moved through the Canaveral moonstop
And everynaut would dance and sway

[Pre-Chorus]
Got music in our solar system
We're space truckin' 'round the stars

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

[Verse 3]
The fireball that we rode was moving
But now we've got a new machine
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, the freaks said
"Man this cat can really swing!"
They got music in the solar system
They danced around the Milky Way
They danced around with Borealis

[Pre-Chorus]
We're space truckin' every day

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

[Instrumental break 2:38-3:36]

[Guitar Solo]

[Drum Solo]

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, space truckin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, space truckin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, space truckin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, space truckin'
