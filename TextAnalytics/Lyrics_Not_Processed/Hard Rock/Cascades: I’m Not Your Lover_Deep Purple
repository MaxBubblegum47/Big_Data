[Verse 1]
You know I'm not
Your lover now
It might as well be said
And then you say
You're leaving
Or maybe I'm just
Hanging on a thread
When I gave you everything
It didn't seem that much
You gave me your opinion
With the usual
Heavy handed touch

[Chorus][2x]
What can I do
About the rain that falls on you
I'm not your lover now [2x]

[Verse 2]
My head is spinning endlessly
My sense won't react
Then I'm falling through a black hole
Part of me is never coming back
How you can lose a thing
You never really had
And you always hurt the one you love
And you just love to hurt me bad

[Chorus][2x]

[Verse 3]
You really must be going now
By god, is that the time?
Let me put you out
Of my misery
They call it being cruel
To be kind
I only insult my friends
My friend
The rest can go to hell
You can read it
Anyway you want
Oh well, you're not so bad yourself

[Chorus][2x]
