There once was a woman
A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery
I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said, "I ain't for taking, won't you ever learn?"

I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman

She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy, you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better, she said
"Saturday nights from now on baby, you're my star"

I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
Yeah, I got a strange kind of woman
And I said, oh, I love you

I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
Yeah, I got a strange kind of woman

She finally said she loved me
I wed her in a hurry
No more callers and I glowed with pride
I'm dreaming
I feel like screaming
I won my woman just before she died

I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
Yeah, I got a strange kind of woman
Ah, she was a weird one, alright
[...] New York [...] we ended up in Manhattan [...]
It's all served
She was a strange kind of woman
She was a strange kind of woman
Ohh, I, I love, I love you babe

"Fantastic, thank you very much!
How you doin', alright?"
