[Verse]
Flying to Salt Lake City
Seats 3A and B
I was down and needed a window
But in 3A sat Mitzi Dupree
She said, "Hi I am Mitzi the queen of the ping pong
Where you going boy"
I said, "Nowhere"
She said, "I'm moving on"
I thought what is this
I cannot resist, here she is
And I've always wanted a girl with a name
A name like Mitzi Dupree
She said, "What do you do"
I said, "I'm a singer in a band"
She said, "Yeah I'm an entertainer"
Reached out and took my hand
She was going to a mining town
Way up north to do her show
I said, "It must be cold up there"
She said, "Depends on who you know"
Oh, that look in her eye, I can tell you no lies
I'm just a man, she made me feel
Like a king in my mind, I love you Mitzi Dupree
I know I love you Mitzi Dupree
I said, "What is this queen of the ping pong business"
She smiled, "What do you think
It has no connection with China"
I said, "Have another drink"
Well I knew right away
That I'd seen her act before
In a room behind a kitchen in Bangkok
And three or four times more in Singapore
She may not be the first
But I know she isn't the worst
She was mine but I ran out of time
I miss you, I love you Mitzi Dupree

[Outro]
My darling Mitzi Dupree
My darling, my darling
My darling Mitzi Dupree
Mitzi Dupree
I love you Mitzi Dupree
