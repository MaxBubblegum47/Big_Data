Outside her window
That's where I am every night and every day
But outside her window
I cry, I cried my life away

There's a jukebox a-playin'
A half a block down
Singing I'm going to the river
I'm gonna jump on in and drown
But I ain't gonna do it, no
Just gonna keep on hanging around

Oh it's all over
Oh it's all over
All over
Now, now, now, now

But outside her window
A pretty bird comes to play
And I know, I know I must have cried a teardrop
Because I scared that pretty little thing right on away

When I see two young lovers
Walkin' down the street
It just hits me
When I see their two lips meet
Oh I put my head
Right over where my heart used to be, 'cos

It's all over
Oh don't tell me it's all over
It's all over
Now, now, now, now
