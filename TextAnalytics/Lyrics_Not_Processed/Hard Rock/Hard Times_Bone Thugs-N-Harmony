And yes we would be blessed
If we could rest in heaven (heaven, heaven, heaven)
And wouldn't you be blessed
If you could rest in heaven (heaven, heaven, heaven)
Now I can vouch with God as my witness
That this wickedness will not remain
Youve got to make up your mind
You wanna be saved?
Make up your mind
Or do you wanna die?
You wanna die
Oh yes were thugs were more than thugs
Got soldiers wastelands warriors
We're on a mission for God
So bartenda, bartenda, bartenda
So much hurt and pain
Bloody murders man
So much hurt and pain
Bloody murders man
