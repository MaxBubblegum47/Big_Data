We roll tonight
To the guitar bite

[Verse 1]
Stand up and be counted
For what you are about to receive
We are the dealers
We'll give you everything you need
Hail-hail to the good times
'Cause rock has got the right of way
We ain’t no legend, ain’t no cause
We're just living for today

[Chorus]
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you

[Verse 2]
We rock at dawn, on the front line
Like a bolt right out of the blue
The sky's alight with the guitar bite
Heads will roll and rock, tonight

[Chorus]
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you (Yes we do)
For those about to rock, we salute you
Ah, we salute




[Solo]

Load up

[Verse 3]
We're just a battery for hire with a guitar fire
Ready and aimed at you
Pick up your balls and load up your cannon
For a twenty-one gun salute

[Bridge]
For those about to rock - fire!
(We salute you)
Oh, for those about to rock
(We salute you)
Oh, those about to rock - fire!
(We salute you)
Ow - fire!
We salute you
We salute you
Come on

[Outro]
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot
Ah, for those who give, and those who take
Doing your time, and those on the rank
We salute you
Yeah
We salute you
We salute you
We salute you
Fire!
