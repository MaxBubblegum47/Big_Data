[Intro: 
Patti Smith
]
You're boned like a saint
With the consciousness of a snake

[Verse 1: Albert Bouchard & 
Patti Smith
]
You're the kind of girl–
kind of girl
I'd like to find
Face like an angel–
in my mirror
But you're boned like the devil
Your eyes have shifted from me–
have shift
Everyone saw what you did–
your eyes
You have slipped from beneath me–
from me
Like a false and nervous squid

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard & 
Patti Smith
]
Oh, no more horses, horses
We're going to swim like a fish–
we're gonna swim like a fish
Into the hole in which you planned to ditch me
My lovely, Vera Marie!

[Verse 2: Albert Bouchard & 
Patti Smith
]
I was soaring
Planned to leave me cold–
a sound
But you'll never get your wish–
feeling appeal
On the twenty-fourth of May–
birthday
I gather up your reins
You filled me with a vengeance–
filled me
And you touched me with your breath–
vengeance
I'm gonna pull you from this dance–
this dance
You're gonna ride so easily

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard & 
Patti Smith
]
Oh, no more horses, horses
We're going to swim like a fish–
we're gonna swim like a fish
Into the hole in which you planned to ditch me
My lovely, Vera Marie!

[Bridge: Albert Bouchard & 
Patti Smith
]
Hey! Come on, Vera!
Each night
I dance

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard & 
Patti Smith
]
Oh, no more horses, horses
We're going to swim like a fish–
we're gonna swim like a fish
Into the hole in which you planned to ditch me
My lovely, Vera Marie!

[Verse 3: Albert Bouchard & 
Patti Smith
]
I was your victim–
victim
I was well-deceived–
deceived
Hell's built on regret–
regret
But I love your naked neck
And evil lies that you told me–
your lies
Made me believe you're two-faced–
it's true
But there's two faces have you
And they're both gonna go

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard & 
Patti Smith
]
Oh, no more horses, horses
We're going to swim like a fish–
gonna swim like a fish
Into the hole in which you planned to ditch me–
ditch me
My lovely, Vera Gemini!
