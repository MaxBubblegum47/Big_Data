Cry Free
(Blackmore/Gillan/Glover/Lord/Paice/)
Pass your mother, lose your brother
Be a lover, too
Well all together make it better
You gotta cry free
Bridges burnin', eyes are turnin'
Now they're learnin' fools
They're gonna talk it over
While they're talkin'
You gotta cry Free
Cry free
Fists are shakin', homes are breakin'
Know what's makin' blues
Oh true convictions, satisfaction
While you cry free
