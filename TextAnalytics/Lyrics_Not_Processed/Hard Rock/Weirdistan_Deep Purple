[Verse]
We travelled through time and we’re on the stretcher’s end
We’re all from up north and I live in Wonderland
Dear neighbor of mine was centuries, light years apart
You carry no flame, you’re visible in the dark
Bring it across the border, all those people are waiting flags
Some of them need a few rich men but I can’t prove that something holds me back
The man in the moon is looking the other way
And while he’s distracted we turn to another page
No questions or guilt, it seems like we’re just out of say
You do what you will, I’ll do another thing
Imagine when we’ll wake up
Scratching here, everything’s changed
While you spray here with it
You’ll know reality’s been rearranged

[Outro] [x3]
It’s beautiful
Oh yes, it’s beautiful
Oh yes, we merge into one
