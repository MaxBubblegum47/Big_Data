[Intro]
There stands the glass
That will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain
It's my first one today
There stands the glass
That-that will ease all my pain
That-that will settle my brain
It's-it's my first one today

[Verse 1]
Ayy
I saw your sister at work
I saw your mama at church
I'm pretty sure I saw your car at the mall
I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call

[Pre-Chorus]
It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to

[Chorus]
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

[Verse 2]
Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch, on the swing
You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been dragging your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it funny how I can't seem
To get away from you?
It's almost like you don't want me to

[Chorus]
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

[Bridge]
There stands the glass
That-that will ease all my pain
That-that will settle my brain
It's-it's my first one today

[Chorus]
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

[Outro]
Oh honey, I'm fallin' apart
And you're playin' hard to forget
