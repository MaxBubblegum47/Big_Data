[Verse 1]
I met my love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
I kissed my girl by the factory wall

[Refrain]
Dirty old town, dirty old town

[Verse 2]
Clouds are drifting across the moon
Cats are prowling on their beat
Spring's a girl from the streets at night

[Refrain]
Dirty old town, dirty old town

[Verse 3]
I heard a siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
I smelled the spring on the smoky wind

[Refrain]
Dirty old town, dirty old town

[Verse 4]
I'm gonna make me a big sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
I'll chop you down like an old dead tree

[Refrain]
Dirty old town, dirty old town

[Verse 1]
I met my love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
I kissed my girl by the factory wall

[Refrain]
Dirty old town, dirty old town
Dirty old town, dirty old town
