[Verse 1]
You remember that night when I hit a red light
And you pulled up next to me?
We were two young cats feeling under attack
Just making out in the street

[Pre-Chorus]
It felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory

[Chorus 1]
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you always took so right with your jeans all tight
Like you're walking in a magazine
Will you hold my hand, say you are my man
And you only have eyes for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, it felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory

[Chorus 1]
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go go go go

[Chorus 2]
I think I been here before
It doesn't matter
Hold me back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are
I think I been here before
It doesn't matter
Hold me back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are

[Verse 1]
You remember that night when I hit a red light
And you pulled up next to me?
We were two young cats feeling under attack
Just making out in the street

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, it felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory

[Chorus 1]
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go, let me go
Let me go

[Chorus 2]
I think I been here before
It doesn't matter
Hold me back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are
I think I been here before
It doesn't matter
Hold me back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are

[Bridge]
Remember that night, yeah
Remember that night, oh
Remember that night, yeah
Remember that night, oh

[Outro]
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
