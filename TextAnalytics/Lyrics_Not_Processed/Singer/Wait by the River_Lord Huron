[Verse 1]
I will wait by the river
In the light of the moon
At the edge of the city
I will wait for you
Though I can't wait forever
Someday I'll be dead and gone
And I won't be forgiven
For what I've done

[Hook]
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river

[Verse 2]
I will cry out to heaven
As it rains down on me
I will beg for forgiveness
Get down on my knees
If I can't change the weather
Maybe I can change your mind
If we can't be together
What's the point of life

[Bridge]
Baby, I didn't mean the things I said
I don't honestly wish you were dead
I'm a fool; I'm just a man
If I only could hold you again

[Verse 3]
And the stars fill the river
As it flows into the sky
And the mind leaves the body
And floats higher and higher
If we can't be together
I will leave this world behind
If I can't touch your body
Can I touch the sky?

[Hook]
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
