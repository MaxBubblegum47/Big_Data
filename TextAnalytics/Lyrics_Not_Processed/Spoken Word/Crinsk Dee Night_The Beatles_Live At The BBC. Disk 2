[Verse 1]

[Brian Matthew] The next few minutes, we're in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and now that they--

[Paul] Yes?

[John] Hey! Listen!

[Paul] It's all changed, now, Brian They're not doing that, no actors

[John] It's all changed, now

[Brian] But this is what I wonder In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor, did you find that?

[John] No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film You should have seen the rest

[Verse 2]

[Brian] Yes?

[John] Rubbish!

[Brian] Was it, really?

[John] Even worse, yes

[Brian] Who was worst?

[John] Oh, Paul

[Brian] I see

[Paul] I think John was about the worst

[John] No, it was you

[Verse 3]

[Paul] Oh, Ringo was very good, he was, he's a good lad

[Brian] He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin Do you think that's right?

[John] He was miming

[Paul] You, too, with Jason

[John] Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?

[Brian] Beginning to look like that Now, then--

[Ringo] All right, John. Can you hear me?

[Verse 4]

[Paul] Can you hear him? Hello!

[Brian] Not really I hope not I hope not!

[John] We brought you the flowers, Ring

[Brian] He's not allowed to talk

[Ringo] Eh?

[John] We brought you the flowers

[Verse 5]

[Ringo] Oh, good

[John] And the grapes

[Ringo] Oh, I like grapes

[Paul] He likes grapes

[George] We've been to Portugal

[Brian] Guess who's, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then

[Verse 6]

[All] Who?

[Brian] Los Beatles

[John] Los Beatles? Great, great laugh

[Brian] I don't suppose you know the title of your film in Portuguese?

[John] 
No Crinsk dee Night

[Brian] Could be, let's hear the number, shall we?

[John] Right
