[Rodney Burke] Uh, George is just coming up here with a letter in his hand, you're looking very serious about it, what is it, George?

[George] It's a letter from Cathy of Newport, Isle of Wight, who says: "Paul's been to to the Isle of Wight, why haven't I?" Well, I haven't got the passport, huh. And, and she says, would you please sing a song, uh, for the 5th of St. Teresa [?] Isle of Wight? So we'd like to feature John shouting: "Soldiers of Love."

[Rodney] Alright
