She so flirty
Oh baby you dirty

10 racks to my mans
Gucci on my friends
Oh she so flirty
Oh baby you dirty

Me wrong
But i still wish you well
You got fifty habits

You take my heart
And left me on the trail
But you not just any hoe
You still miss me doe
You still get me doe

Yea im making dough
My life moving fast
Your life moving slow
She so flirty
Oh baby you dirty
10 racks
To my mans
Then i do my dance
10 racks to my mans
Gucci on my friends
Oh she so flirty
Oh baby you dirty
