[Verse 1]
It's been a while but I'm still here
Treading  upon the road, trying to find myself again
Who  am I? Where am I from?
What's my purpose on this earth? Oh Lord

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's my turn, I'll go
For  my destiny, that's where I wanna be
I've  been searching all my life
For the truth, what's right? Never understood why

[Chorus]
I  need to see good vibes, good vibes, good vibes
I need it all around, I need it in my life, life
Good vibes, good vibes, good vibes
I need it all around, I need it in my sound, sound
Some  good vibes, good vibes, good vibes
I need it all around, I need it in my life, life
Good vibes, good vibes, good vibes
I need it all around, I need it in my sound, sound

[Interlude]
(Good vibes, good vibes, good vibes
Good vibes, good vibes, good vibes
Good vibes, good vibes, good vibes
Good vibes, good vibes, good vibes)

[Verse 2]
It's been a while but I'm still here
Treading upon the road, trying to find myself again
Who am I? Where am I from?
What's my purpose on this earth? Oh Lord

It's been a while but I'm still here
Treading upon the road, trying to find myself again
Who am I? Where am I from?
What's my purpose on this earth? Oh Lord

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's my turn, I'll go
For my destiny, that's where I wanna be
I've been searching all my life
For the truth, what's right? Never understood why

[Chorus]
I need to see good vibes, good vibes, good vibes
I need it all around, I need it in my life, life
Good vibes, good vibes, good vibes
I need it all around, I need it in my sound, sound
Some good vibes, good vibes, good vibes
I need it all around, I need it in my life, life
Good vibes, good vibes, good vibes
I need it all around, I need it in my sound, sound
