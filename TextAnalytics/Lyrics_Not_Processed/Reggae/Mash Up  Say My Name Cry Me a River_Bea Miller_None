[Verse 1]
Any other day
I would call, you would say
Baby hows your day
But today ain't the same

[Verse 2]
Every other word is
Uh huh, yeah or okay
Could it be that you
Are at the crib with another lady
An if you took it there
First of all let me say
I am not to one to sit around and be played

[Verse 3]
So prove yourself to me
I'm the one that you claim
Why would would you say the things
That you said to me yesterday

[Chorus 1-Say My Name]
Say my name
Say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name
Say my name
You actin' kinda shaky
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change
Say my name
Say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name (my name)
Say my name (my name)

[Verse 4]
I know that they say
Somethings are better left unsaid
But it wasn't like you only
Talked to him and you know it
(Oh No)

[Verse 5]
And all of these things
People tell me
Keep messing with my head
You should have picked honestly
Then you may not have blown it
(No No)

[Verse 6]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me
All alone?
You tell me you need me
When you call me
On the phone whoa
Boy I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your bridges were burned
And now its your turn
To cry

[Chorus 2-Cry Me a River]
So cry me a river
Cry me a river-er
So cry me a river
Cry me a river-er

[Chorus 1-Say My Name]
Say my name
Say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name
Say my name
You actin' kinda shaky
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change
Say my name
Say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game

[Chorus 3-Say My Name/Cry Me a River Combo]
Say my name (my name)
Say my name
Then cry me a river
Cry me, cry me
Say my name
Then cry me a river
Cry me, cry me
Say my name
The cry me a river
Cry me, cry me
Say my name
Then cry me a river
Cry me, cry me
Say my name
Then cry me a river
