Lyrics From Snippet

Two bananas for one dollar
One for sixty cent
You down ten if you don’t get the two
If you get the two, you save ten
You do that six times you got a whole new banana just for stayin' in business
But what if you only want one banana?
So you going to spend three bucks and that's only five bananas? Sh
Is you dumb? Sh
It's not even worth it dude
You ain’t never gonna catch me with a bana-
