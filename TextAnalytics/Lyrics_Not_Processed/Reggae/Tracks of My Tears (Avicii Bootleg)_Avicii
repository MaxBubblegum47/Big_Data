[Verse]
Since you left me, if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute, she’s just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one

[Pre-Chorus]
So take a good look at my face, ooooh
You'll see my smile, yeah
Look a little bit closer and it’s easy, oh
The tracks of my tears

[Chorus]
My smile is my make up I wear since my break up with you
Baby take a good look at my, ooooh
You'll see my smile looks out of, yeah
Just a look closer and it's easy, ooh
The tracks of my tears (baby, baby, baby, baby)
So take a good look at, ooooh
Yeah, you'll see my smile, oooh
Look a little bit closer
I need you, need you

[Instrumenal]
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
