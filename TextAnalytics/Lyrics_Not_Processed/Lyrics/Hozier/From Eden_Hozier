[Verse 1]
Babe
There's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?

Babe
There's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No tired sigh, no rolling eyes
No irony
No "Who cares?", no vacant stare
No time for me

[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

[Verse 2]
Babe
There's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin?

Babe
There's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh, what a sin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To the strand, a picnic planned
For you and me
A rope in hand for your other man
To hang from a tree

[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to hide outside your door
