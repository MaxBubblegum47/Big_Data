[Verse 1: Hozier]
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the heaven of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Chorus: Hozier & 
Mavis Staples
]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry
 (Power) 
power
, (Power) 
power
Hey, power
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

[Verse 2: Hozier]
It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow man, it's mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Chorus: Hozier & 
Mavis Staples
]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Oh, power
Nina cried power
Lennon cried power
James Brown cried power
And I could cry
 (Power) 
power
, (Power) 
power
Hey, power
B.B. cried power
Joni cried power
Nina cried power

[Bridge: Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you to
Rattle your chains if you love being free

[Chorus: Hozier & 
Mavis Staples
]
But I could cry power (Power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power
Seeger cried power
Marvin cried power
Yeah ah, power
James cried power
Lennon cried power
Patti cried power
Billie
, power
Dylan
, power
Woody
, power
Nina cried power
