[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Find my back in the cold, trapped in another soul, they can hear me holler
I'm caught in it again, see 'em all strapped in an' can't move and I'm sinkin' lower
Heaven gonna help me 'cause I feel the world weighin' on me heavy, tryna keep it steady
Ready for the mission, God, shine your love on me, save me, please
If I'm goin' alone, I've been gone for so long, ain't nobody, you can't hear a word
Perched in the night, lookinâ€™ out nowhere, where's home? I done hit a nerve
Pain in my eyes, everytime I find, I'm stronger than I ever was
Here we go again, God, shine your love on me, save me, please

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson & Kid Cudi]
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Everybody want world peace
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece
Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace
Bring light to what they don't see
Auntie cryin' on the concrete
Talkin' to dispatcher then the phone beep
On the other line was the homies
Told her that you ain't comin' home, see
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep
Caught with the rifle with the long reach
Just another cycle of the lonely
All growin' up in environment
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement
Hopefully Alice Johnson will inspire men

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson, Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong

[Outro: Kanye West, Kid Cudi & Mr. Hudson]
Both sides lose somebody
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Somebody dies, somebody goes to jail
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Lord, shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Shine your light on me
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
