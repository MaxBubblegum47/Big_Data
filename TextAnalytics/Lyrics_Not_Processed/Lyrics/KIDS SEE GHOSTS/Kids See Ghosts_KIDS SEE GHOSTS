[Chorus: Yasiin Bey]
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Movin' around, just movin' around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Yeah, that's the king

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Stop that movement, stop that movement
Y'all can't move me, this my movie
Y'all can't stop me, y'all too sloppy
Carbon copied, carbon
Same thing, in a room
Sittin' by myself, findin' heaven soon
Many things that will trouble you
Look beyond for a feelin' like you never knew
Reachin' out, huntin' for the truth
I'm guessin' I'm just sick of runnin'
All this time searchin' hard for somethin'
I can hear the angels comin'

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Movin' around, just movin' around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Yeah, that's the king

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Well, it took me long enough to rap on this strong enough
Paid this shit just gon' give up, 'cause Ye just gon' live up
To everything that sucks to you and that's never enough
Thought I'd be clever enough to give up while I'm ahead
I like breakfast in bed, but I love breakfast and head
For anybody who said that I was better off dead
Told 'em, "Don't ever believe nothin' that you ever read"
Got a Bible by my bed, oh yes, I'm very Christian
Constantly repentin', 'cause, yes, I never listen
Don't like bein' questioned and don't like bein' less than
Any a competition in any of my professions
So I gotta guess then, I gotta stay the best man
What else you expect from, uh, Mr. West, man
Painting from Wes Lang, hung in my space like a relative
That you ain't seen in a minute, called on the telephone
And when they see you they say, “Damn you got hella grown
Always thought you'd make it, but damn now you hella known"
Let's address some topics that I can embellish on
How we made enough bread for us to put some relish on
I won't relish on the fact I'm vibin' on the future
Ultralight buildin' in the buildin' by Miuccia
Herzog and de Meuron in an office out in Basel
No not Miami, Switzerland (Switzerland, ahahaha)

[Chorus: Yasiin Bey]
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Movin' around, just movin' around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit (spirit, spirit, spirit)
Yeah, that's the king

[Bridge: Yasiin Bey]
Civilization without society
Power and wealth with nobility
Stability without stasis
Places and spaces
Civilization without society
Power and wealth with nobility
Stability without stasis
Spaces and places

[Outro: Yasiin Bey]
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts—ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Yeah, that's the king
And what's a crown for the clouds, movin' around
Yeah, that's the king
And what's a crown to the clouds, movin' around
