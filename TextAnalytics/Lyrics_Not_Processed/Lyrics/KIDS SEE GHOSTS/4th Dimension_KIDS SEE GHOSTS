[Intro: Louis Prima]
Down the chimney, he will come
With his great big smile
And you'll find that even the kiddies
Are swingin' in the latest style

[Chorus: Louis Prima]
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing us?
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It feels so good, it should cost
Bought a alligator, I ain't talkin' Lacoste
Made me say, "Ugh, uh"
Like a mix of Master P and Rick Ross, uh-uh
She seem to make me always feel like a boss, uh-uh
She said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost, uh-uh
She said I'm goin' too fast, I'm exhausted
Now drop to your knees for the offerin'
This the theme song of something wrong
Might need an intervention for this new dimension
That's too new to mention, or fit in a sentence
If I get locked up, I won't finish the sent—

[Chorus: Louis Prima]
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?

[Interlude]
(Laughter)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Gettin' loose while I'm rollin' through, see me roll out
Watch you surf, hit the coast, and this feelin', I got
Plenty of ventures for the evenin', we go journey, we off
From the light to guide us home, we in the moment, oh-oh
Such a lost boy, caught up in the darkest I had
What's the cost, boy? Losin' everything that I had
She been on me, boy, 'less you got somethin' to tell
Sittin', waitin' for me slippin', yeah, I'll see you in hell
Tell the cougar get up off me, no, my soul ain't for sale
All the evils in the world, they keepin' on me for real
I really hope the Lord heard me, we all live in sin
Kids See Ghosts off the ropes, Ric Flair on your bitch
Now this the theme song, this the theme song
The put the beams on, get your, get your dream on
But you don't hear me though, drama: we let it go
Watch the guitars roll, but let your friends know

[Chorus: Louis Prima]
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?

[Outro: Shirley Ann Lee]
Just do that and then let the music do somethin',  and then do that again, that'd be enough for a record
I mean, you only want two and a half minutes if you can get it, you know, three minutes max—
