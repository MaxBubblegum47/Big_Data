[Verse 1]
Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it: New York, New York
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it: New York, New York

[Hook]
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

[Verse 2]
These little town blues, are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York

[Hook]
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

[Verse 3]
New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
King of the hill, a number one

[Outro]
These little town blues, oh, are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York
And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York
