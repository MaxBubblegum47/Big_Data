[Chorus]
I've been a Friday night rambler
I've been a do what I please
I was a never get tied down member of the bar crowd
That's my scene
It was a whiskey on the rocks
Type to stay out way too late
But the first time she walked in and I saw her
Damn near all that changed

[Chorus]
She's got a way to get me spinning off track
She's got a way when she flips her hair back
Yeah, she knows that I'm staring like she's daring me to look away
She's got a way when she dances like that
She's gotten good at making me want her bad
Never thought I'd be here fallin' all in love, but what can I say?
She's got a way (hey)
Yeah, she's got a way (hey)

[Verse 2]
She's a different kinda party
She's a different kinda watching that sun come up
Staying in on Friday nights now, I get an even better buzz

[Chorus]
She's got a way to get me spinning off track
She's got a way when she flips her hair back
Yeah, she knows that I'm staring like she's daring me to look away
She's got a way when she dances like that
She's gotten good at making me want her bad
Never thought I'd be here fallin' all in love, but what can I say?
She's got a way
Yeah, she's got a way

She's got a way to get me spinning off track
She's got a way when she flips her hair back
Yeah, she knows that I'm staring like she's saying don't look away
She's got a way when she dances like that
She's gotten good at me wanting her bad
Never thought I'd be here fallin' all in love, but what can I say?
She's got a way
Yeah, she's got a way

[Outro]
She's got a way
Yeah, she's got a way (hey)
