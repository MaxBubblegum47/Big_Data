[Verse 1: Aaron Lewis]
Now I grew up down an old dirt road, in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks, back in nineteen sixty-four
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day he'd put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man, and the whiskey's known to change a man

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
But, that's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go, 
in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis & 
George Jones
]
Now it's been twelve years since I sold my soul, to the devil in L.A
He said sign your name here on the dotted line, and your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said, 
"You wanna sell a million records, boy? You better listen to me"

[Bridge: Aaron Lewis & 
George Jones
]
He said, 
"Change your style, whiten your smile
You could lose a couple pounds
If you want to live this life, you'd better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around?"

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
I said, "no that's not me"
'Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts, and a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis]
'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourty-five
I've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck, and my idea of heaven's chasin' white tail bucks
And as a country boy, I know I can survive

[Verse 3: Aaron Lewis]
Now two flags fly above my land, and really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue
The other one's got a rattlesnake, with a simple statement made
"Don't tread on me" is what it says, and I'll take that to my grave

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
Because, this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause my family's always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Outro: Charlie Daniels]
I love my country, I love my guns, I love my family, I love the way it is now
And anybody that tries to change it, has to come through me
That should be all of our attitudes, 'cause this is America, and a country boy is good enough for me, son
