[Verse 1: Chris Young]
I walk in on Friday nights
Same old bar, same burned out lights
Same people and all the same faces
So why in the hell does it feel like a different place?

[Verse 2: Cassadee Pope]
Meet my friends for a girls' night out
Seems there ain't much to talk about
Same drinks that we're all raising
But all of the toasts just don't feel the same

[Chorus: Both]
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you

[Verse 3: Chris Young & 
Both
]
They keep asking how I am
But they're really asking where you've been
I can read between all of the lines
It ain't just us missing all of the times

[Chorus: Both]
We were the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you

[Bridge: Chris Young & 
Cassadee Pope
]
Ain't it funny how a flame like that
Oh whoa, when they think of you
It can burn when it's in the past

[Chorus: Both]
We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you

[Outro: Both]
Oh, they think of you
When they think of me
Baby, baby, oh
When they think of me, they think of you
