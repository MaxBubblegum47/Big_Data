[Intro]
I'm cryin’ 'cause I love you, oh
(Ya ya ya, ya ya, ya ya)

[Verse 1]
Never been in love before
What the fuck are fucking feelings, yo?
Once upon a time, I was a ho
I don't even wanna ho no mo’
Got you something from the liquor store
Little bit of Lizzo and some Mo
Tryna open up a little mo'
Sorry if my heart a little slow

[Chorus]
I thought that I didn't care
I thought I was love-impaired
But baby, baby
I don't know what I'm gon' do
I'm cryin' ’cause I love you, oh
Yes, you (Ya ya, ya ya)

[Verse 2]
Got me standing in the rain
Gotta get my hair pressed again
I would do it for you all, my friend
Ready, baby? Will you be my man?
Wanna put you on a plane
Fly you out to wherever I am
Catch you on the low, I was ashamed
Now I’m crazy, 'bout to tat your name

[Chorus]
I thought that I didn’t care
I thought I was love-impaired
But baby, oh baby
I don't know what I'm gon' do
I’m cryin' 'cause I love you, yeah
I'm cryin', hey

[Chorus]
I thought that I didn't care
I thought I was love-impaired
But baby, baby
I don't know what I'm gon' do
I'm cryin' 'cause I love you
Oh yes, you

[Outro]
I'm cryin', I'm cryin', I'm cryin', oh
I'm cryin' 'cause I love you
