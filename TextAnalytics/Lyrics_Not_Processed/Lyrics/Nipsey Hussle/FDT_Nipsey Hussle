[Intro: YG]
Just when I thought it wouldn't get no sicker
Woke up one morning and heard this weird ass mothafucka talkin' out the side of his neck
Me and all my peoples, we always thought he was straight
Influential mothafucka when it came to the business
But now, since we know how you really feel
This how we feel

[Chorus: YG]
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah

[Verse 1: YG]
I like white folks, but I don't like you
All the niggas in the hood wanna fight you
Surprised El Chapo ain't tried to snipe you
Surprised the Nation of Islam ain't tried to find you
Have a rally out in L.A., we gon' fuck it up
Home of the Rodney King riot, we don't give a fuck
Black students, ejected from your rally, what?
I'm ready to go right now, your racist ass did too much
I'm 'bout to turn Black Panther
Don't let Donald Trump win, that nigga cancer
He too rich, he ain't got the answers
He can't make decisions for this country, he gon' crash us
No, we can't be a slave for him
He got me appreciatin' Obama way more
Hey Donald, and everyone that follows
You gave us your reason to be President, but we hate yours

[Chorus: YG]
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
(I don't like your ass, nigga)
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
(I really don't like you, nigga!)
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
(This for my grandma!)
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Nigga, am I trippin'? Let me know
I thought all that Donald Trump bullshit was a joke
Know what they say, when rich niggas go broke...
Look, Reagan sold coke, Obama sold hope
Donald Trump spent his trust fund money on the vote
I'm from a place where you prolly can't go
Speakin' for some people that you prolly ain't know
It's pressure built up and it's prolly gon' blow
And if we say go then they're prolly gon' go
You vote Trump then you're prolly on dope
And if you like me then you prolly ain't know
And if you been to jail you can prolly still vote
We let this nigga win, we gon' prolly feel broke
You build walls, we gon' prolly dig holes
And if your ass do win, you gon' prolly get smoked, nigga
Fuck you!

[Chorus: YG]
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah
(Hold up, I got something to say, hold up)

[Interlude: YG]
We the youth
We the people of this country
We got a voice too
We will be seen
And we will be heard

[Verse 3: YG & Nipsey Hussle]
Hold up, I fuck with Mexicans, got a plug with Mexicans
When the low low need a switch, who I call? A Mexican
This Comedy Central ass nigga couldn't be the President
Hold up, Nip, tell the world how you fuck with Mexicans
It wouldn't be the USA without Mexicans
And if it's time to team up, shit, let's begin
Black love, brown pride in the sets again
White people feel the same as my next of kin
If we let this nigga win, God bless the kids
God bless the kids, this nigga wicked and wigged
When me and Nip link, that's Bloods and Crips
When your L.A. rally? We gon' crash your shit

[Chorus: YG]
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
(I don't like your ass, nigga)
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
(I really don't like you, nigga!)
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
(This for my grandma!)
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah
