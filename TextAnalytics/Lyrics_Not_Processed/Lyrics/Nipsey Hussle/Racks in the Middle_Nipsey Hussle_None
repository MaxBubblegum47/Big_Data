[Intro: Roddy Ricch]
(Hit-Boy)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(TrapAdix)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I was ridin' ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was riding ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T’s and dot my I’s or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin’ battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin’ up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slippin'
Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you, "Nigga, live your life and grow"
I'd tell you, "Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 'til the pipe in smoke"

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck

[Outro: Roddy Ricch]
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
Mhmmhm
