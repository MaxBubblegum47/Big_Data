[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Stains hit my phone cus I'm trapping like a bitch
Facetimin' with the plug but my phone on 3%
Don't be playin' on my line tell me what you tryna get
Hate when niggas want work but they ask to send a pic
I got pounds, I got zips but I could never serve a nick
I got rounds, I got clips and I could never shoot and miss
Top Shoota Dun dodda nigga real ting diss
On Instagram thottin' hoes sendin' naked pics
Call your bitch make a flick hit again and call it quits
Metro fuck a Sprint no location on my shit
Servin' niggas fake bricks remixed with packs, sell it cheap
Watch me quarterback plays like a 28 sweep
All day juggin' on my trap phone
Gettin' on my my nerves switch to airplane mode
Selling hella drugs to a patient
Young nigga trappin' out the vacant

[Hook]
Stupid little bitch wanna front on five grams
You a petty little ho
Three pounds of the gas going for the five bands
Get the plug on the phone
If it ain't about the hunnids nigga what the fuck you want
I might ship it out to Cali while you smokin' home grown
Phone goin' off trappin' like a muthafucker
Karo a whole pint serve it to a dumb sucka

[Verse 2: Father]
Stop playin' on my phone
Aye you at the crib, bitch I'm always fucking home
Best had text 'before you come, nigga you don't know me
Flip phone Nokia to keep it lowkey
Yup, got a cholo I only hit on Motarola
Keep good coke, I don't mean Coca Cola
Speak a little Spanish, yea mamacita hola
Yeah I hit it raw, hope I don't catch Ebola
Damn that was ignorant, going to blame it on my pigment
Niggas think they see me but they only see a figment
Habitual bitch-getter, pick of the litter, nigga
How the hell you figure you better?
You the type of nigga take a bitch leave the cheddar
I'm the type of nigga get the money get her wetter
Need more provolone, nigga need feta
Need to leave that ho alone, nigga do better

[Hook]
Stupid little bitch wanna front on five grams
You a petty little ho
Three pounds of the gas going for the five bands
Get the plug on the phone
If it ain't about the hunnids nigga what the fuck you want
I might ship it out to Cali while you smokin' home grown
Phone goin' off trappin' like a muthafucker
Karo a whole pint serve it to a dumb sucka

[Verse 3: Maxo Kream]
Stupid bitch hit my phone askin' can I front a sack
Told that petty little ho she could never call me back
Only time I text a ho when I'm feenin for some cat
But I could never let the pussy come between me and the trap
On vyvanse, on molly I could never take a nap
Open 24/7 come and get it asap
Even sell flatscreens got a couple Apple Macs
Got so many guns that I even sell straps
Middle fingers to the laws put it all on Snapchat
Only use this phone to trap so I don't got a lotta apps
Got 3 different numbers tryna dodge a wire tap
Get the weed from amigo, get the xansfrom the japs
All day trappin' like a fool
My little brother movin' packs after school
Sellin' hella drugs to a junkie
Young nigga juggin' cross the country

[Hook]
Stupid little bitch wanna front on five grams

Phone goin' off trappin' like a muthafucker
