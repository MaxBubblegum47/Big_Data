[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Pull up my car and go skrrt
Flex on that bitch then I swerve
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Yeah, I think I'm more down to earth
I just might stop with the bars
I did them Xannies on Earth
I woke up right there on Mars
Pull up my car and go skrrt
Flex on that bitch then I swerve
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Yeah, I think I'm more down to earth
I just might stop with the bars
I did them Xannies on Earth
I woke up right there on Mars

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Mixin' the lean with the percs
Sippin' on lean 'til I burp
Venus Serena, I serve
Finger fuck Nina, a perv
I went to Mars on bars
I've been to hell and back
Super Charge, my Dodge
No Hemi, I hellâ€™d my cat
Xannies and lean, I'm dozin' off
Six double G's, it got me lost
Mixin' codeine with alcohol
Poppin' the beans with Adderall
Choppin' a brick like martial art
Flippin' that bitch like somersaults
Xannies I pop like Tylenol
Cookin' a pot like stroganoff
She gave me neck when I met her
She gave the crewneck like a sweater
You at her neck while you sweat her
If you knew better, do better (huh, okay)
I gave her a bar, she hopped in my car
I swerve in a coupe, she blow me like soup

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Pull up my car and go skrrt
Flex on that bitch then I swerve
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Yeah, I think I'm more down to earth
I just might stop with the bars
I did them Xannies on Earth
I woke up right there on Mars
Pull up my car and go skrrt
Flex on that bitch then I swerve
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Yeah, I think I'm more down to earth
I just might stop with the bars
I did them Xannies on Earth
I woke up right there on Mars

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
I do the percys on purpose
I got the xannies for purchase
Percocet, I'm feelin' I'm perfect
Wrapper came packed like a turban
I handle bars like a mongoose (bikes)
Six double G's, I just popped two
Sippin' codeine from my ha-choo
Xans with the lean, call it thot juice
We not congruent I'm obtuse
I'll be on lean like hypotenuse
I take the acid and mushroom
Everything looks like a cartoon
I went and bust down a plain jane
I take the percys like Max Payne
Look at my diamonds, they gang bang
Say you were Nicki like Mack Maine
Adderall, pop 'em like Tylenol
Lean in my alcohol
Sippin' Codeine got me dozin' off
S-90 pills, I'ma pop em all
Coke pill like a white hoe
Molly pill like a white bitch
Smoke three hoes like Tic-Tacs
Breaking down the bar like a Kit Kat

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Pull up my car and go skrrt
Flex on that bitch then I swerve
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Yeah, I think I'm more down to earth
I just might stop with the bars
I did them Xannies on Earth
I woke up right there on Mars
Pull up my car and go skrrt
Flex on that bitch then I swerve
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Flex on that bitch till it hurt
Yeah, I think I'm more down to earth
I just might stop with the bars
I did them Xannies on Earth
I woke up right there on Mars
