[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Hella barred out, you can barely understand me
Popped eight Xans, chew them just like candy
I been going through bullshit with my family
On the bullshit, got the Glock nine handy
Fixing bullshit every day like a plumber
Pulled ol' girl, I forgot the hoe number
Tryna fuck seventy-five hoes by the summer
I just want the neck like the Stone Cold Stunner
Can't see nothing but the Bathing Ape stars
Eight double G's, I've been walking on Mars
Space Jam money, busting juggs in the car
Always lose something when I'm tripping on the bars
Lost a lot of niggas, yeah the pain I remember
Fucked a new hoe, next day I forget her
Hella barred out you can barely understand me
Eight Vic bars chewed 'em just like candy

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
2-milligram pill pressed Alprazolam
No Hi-Tech so we sip Alpharma
Rolls Royce Wraith presidential, Obama
Rolex Rollie iced out, Obama
Tryna get both that's my motherfucking problem
No ski mask, I'm about to go rob them
Hold up, wait, make a U-turn around
Left the damn gun at the trap on the couch
Serving lil niggas getting off the school bus
G37's in the yellow school bus
Murder rate high cause we had a crazy summer
10-1-10 murder block always do numbers
Brain on dummy, pills in my tummy
Living half dead, slow-mo like a zombie
Trapping out my Granny's, Momma can't stand me
Tryna get away so I'm popping all these Xannies

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Bitch I'm on the green S-93
Broke them bitches down and took all 3
Almost trip and stumble, when I talk I mumble
30's keep a couple, I don't Royal Rumble
R.I.P to Bo, they shot and killed my Uncle
He was fifty years old out there jugging bundles
Handlebars but no bicycle
Poppin beans, erase my mental
Talking slow, my speech is slurrin'
Losing sight, my vision blurry
