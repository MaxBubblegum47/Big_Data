[Intro]
Free J Lo, free One Time, free Lil CBD
Ayy, free Lil Wannabe, ayy, free Montana C
Ayy, free J Money, ayy, free E-Funny
Free my crip Popeye, hey, hey, free Lil TY, hey, hey
Free my daddy, hey, he gon' be alright, hey
Kream Gang for life, free my nigga Ike
I got homies in the grave, I got homies doin' life

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd rather be carried by 6 before I'm judged by 12
Fuck 12, before I tell, I'll take a .38 shell
I'd rather be carried by 6 before I'm judged by 12
Fuck 12, before I tell, I'll tell 'em crackers burn in hell

[Chorus]
I got homies in the grave, I got brothers in the pen
I got some that's comin' home, I got some that's goin' in
Tried to go to visitation, but they wouldn't let me in
So our only conversation writin' letters with a pen
Wanna see just how you doin', wanna know just how you been
Tell you who your bitch been screwin', check in on your mom and 'em
Hope you get a second chance, we been down since elementary
Hope one day we meet again, break you out this penitentiary

[Verse 1]
Cuz, what's crackin'? Hope you straight, know you thuggin' like you should
Seen your momma yesterday, gave her money for your books
Different day, the same shit, nothing changed on Murda Block
Couple homies hit a lick and got the other homies popped
They got shot up with a K, I got good and bad news
They say Redro gon' be straight, but Sto Groove ain't make it through
They hit Redro with a eight, only hit Sto Groove with two
'Round this time last year in May, crackhead junkie killed Young Doof
I seen your stupid baby momma, she still actin' like a thot
Always fightin', startin' drama, she be fuckin' with the opps
Asked her why she never write you, why she never help you out
She say you trippin', you don't listen, and your temper always hot
But let me tell you 'bout your daughter, yesterday, she tried to walk
Every day, she gettin' smarter, other day, she tried to talk
You can't be there like a father and it's fuckin' with you mentally
Court-appointed lawyer got my bro a half a century

[Bridge]
Give me strength to count my blessings, Lord knows it could be worse
I got niggas in the pen and I got niggas in the dirt
Pray to God to keep my faith, 'cause right now, I'm losin' hope
So I'ma pray to that dope, put that faith in my work

[Chorus]
I got homies in the grave, I got brothers in the pen
I got some that's comin' home, I got some that's goin' in
Tried to go to visitation, but they wouldn't let me in
So our only conversation writin' letters with a pen
Wanna see just how you doin', wanna know just how you been
Tell you who your bitch been screwin', check in on your mom and 'em
Hope you get a second chance, we been down since elementary
Hope one day we meet again, break you out this penitentiary

[Verse 2]
I know you worried 'bout me, cuzzo, we ain't talked in a minute
Don't think a nigga tryna ignore you, I'm just handlin' business
On my way here, I was blowin' and they told the lieutenant
Word got back to the warden and they canceled my visit
I dropped 40 on a lawyer, tryna reduce your sentence
He better than that court-appointed, he gon' fight to appeal it
But you gotta stop trippin', I heard they caught ya with a phone
And they threw you in the hole, you probably wonder how I know
I miss them days when we was mobbin', we was robbin' just for fun
If you was fightin', then we fightin', jump 'em, ain't no one on one
Remember clutchin' at the function, I got locked up with a gun
You went in every nigga pockets and got money for my bond
I know you really miss them streets, but you ain't really missin' none
I know this rap shit look real sweet, but my real life, it ain't no fun
'Cause right now, I'm out on bond, my dude, he on probation
My lil' bro on the run, he think he on vacation
My pops back in the system, he just might die in prison
My mom is co-defendant, so she got locked up with him
He got snitched on by his own sister, she the eyewitness
Now every time I see my blood cousins, I don't even feel 'em
See what them drugs, they took my own cousins, started actin' different
Cookin' drugs with my older brother, bakin' soda whippin'
Servin' drugs with my older brother 'til he started sniffin'
I think my bro addicted
I tried to put my nigga on and then he ended up stealin'
I caught that nigga stealin' crumbs when I was plottin' on millions
Believe in death before dishonor, Father God, please forgive him
I pray to God 'cause if I see him, swear to God, I'ma kill him
I got some change, my niggas changed, I'm gettin' change, they think I'm rich
They want me locked up in a cage, I'm fightin' RICO just like Mitch
The only time I wear a suit and tie is at a funeral or a courtroom for trial

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd rather be carried by 6 before I'm judged by 12
Fuck 12, before I tell, I'll take a .38 shell
I'd rather be carried by 6 before I'm judged by 12
Fuck 12, before I tell, I'll tell 'em crackers burn in hell

[Chorus]
I got homies in the grave, I got brothers in the pen
I got some that's comin' home, I got some that's goin' in
Tried to go to visitation, but they wouldn't let me in
So our only conversation writin' letters with a pen
Wanna see just how you doin', wanna know just how you been
Tell you who your bitch been screwin', check in on your mom and 'em
Hope you get a second chance, we been down since elementary
Hope one day we meet again, break you out this penitentiary
