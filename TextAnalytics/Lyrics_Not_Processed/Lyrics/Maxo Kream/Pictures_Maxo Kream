[Chorus: Lil Noid]
Try me, try me if you wanna try
When I'm on the [?] I think I can fly
Try me, try me if you wanna try
When I'm on the [?] I think I can fly
Try me, try me if you wanna try
When I'm on the [?] I think I can fly
Try me, try me if you wanna try
When I'm on the [?] I think I can fly

[Verse 1: YUNG OOZE]
Posted with the blunt, and I don't need to take no fuckin' pictures
Fuckin' wit' yo' bitch she keep on sendin' me all type of pictures
Been a duck, jukin' and dodgin' all these unzipped zippers
I don't trust no ho, screenshots posted when I'm scrollin' Insta
Gram in the wood
I don't give a fuck about who is wit' you
Who you know, and what you didâ€”I'll be smokin' 'till I get blisters
Pass it to the mirror, hit it twice and pass it back
Smoke a sack, spill some act
Got a tombstone, fuck a plaque

[Chorus: Lil Noid]
Try me, try me if you wanna try
When I'm on the [?] I think I can fly
Try me, try me if you wanna try
When I'm on the [?] I think I can fly

[Verse 2: LIL REMAINS]
Creep at night, look for homicide, those I want to die
I am anti-christ, your saviour
The god in flesh, tonight
Lullabies, I'm singin', with blood comin' down my eyes
Walkin' over dead, who's fulla lead
I had to kill him in my torture chamber, yeah
Koopsta Knicca told me do it, so I could not say no to him
No-no, no-no
How many times I said it that I want to go?
Glock to my temple, devil tells me no

[Chorus: Lil Noid]
Try me, try me if you wanna try
When I'm on the [?] I think I can fly
Try me, try me if you wanna try
When I'm on the [?] I think I can fly

[Verse 3: MAXO KREAM]
You steady postin' with that burner
You ain't shoot shit
You just takin' pictures
.44 nickel hit ya, hollow split ya
T-shirt with yo' picture
Magazine come get your issue
Blow like tissue, smoke like Swisher
Pull up to your residential
We can't find you, shoot your sister
.223's through window, Trigger Maxo, bitch, you know my name
Joysticks like Nintendo since you niggas think that it's a game
Call of Duty tactics with that plastic, stretch you like elastic
Flip 'em like gymnastics, acrobatic
Fuck a open casket

[Chorus: Lil Noid]
Try me, try me if you wanna try
When I'm on the [?] I think I can fly
Try me, try me if you wanna try
When I'm on the-
