[Verse 1]
Go ahead and park after dark
Fallen star, I'm your one call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls, I am your escape

[Pre-Chorus]
When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel

[Chorus]
If you’ve been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don’t have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

[Verse 2]
Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want
Sincerity

[Pre-Chorus]
Souls that dream alone lie awake
I’ll give you somethin’ so real

[Chorus]
If you've been waitin’ for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I’ve been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

[Bridge]
Hold me oh so close
'Cause you never know
Just how long our lives will be

[Chorus]
If you've been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
