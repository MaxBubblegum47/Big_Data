[Intro]
I'ma fuck up my life
I'ma fuck up my life
I'ma fuck up my life
I'ma fuck up my life

[Verse 1]
I'ma fuck up my life
I'ma fuck up my life
We gon' party all night
She don't care if I die
Yeah, right, yeah, right
Yeah, I bet you won't cry
Yeah, I bet you won't try
But you know I don't mind
But you know I don't mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah right, yeah right
Yeah right, yeah right
Yeah right, yeah right

[Chorus]
Yeah, you bet I know that she ain't
Never give a single fuck about me
Yeah, you bet she know that we ain't
Never gonna be together, I see
Yeah, you bet I go to see you when
I'm feeling like a drum without a beat
Yeah, you dance so good
And I think that's kinda neat

[Verse 2]
What you know about love?
What you know about life?
What you know about blood?
Bitch, you ain't even my type
Yeah right, yeah right
Yeah, you know I feel right
Yeah, you living right now
You don't ever pick sides
Yeah right, yeah right
I'm overthinking my pride
But I don't gotta look nice
She just feelin' my ice
(She just feelin' my-)

[Chorus]
Yeah, you bet I know that she ain't
Never give a single fuck about me
Yeah, you bet she know that we ain't
Never gonna be together, I see
Yeah, you bet I go to see you when
I'm feeling like a drum without a beat
Yeah, you dance so good
And I think that's kinda neat
