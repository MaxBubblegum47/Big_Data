[Chorus]
I can't get over you
Can’t get over you
And before I die I pray that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you, no one can

[Verse]
Highlights, in the limelight
Can you show me, to the nightlife
Baby I like, all colors like
But I want you, and I don’t know right (Don't know right)
Tell me more, I got a box cutter with your name on it
Tell me more, I can't stay this long on the same topic
I don't know you, but would I fall in love with you?
I don't have no social cues
I'm all for you (Ayy)

[Chorus]
I can't get over you (Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh)
Can't get over you
And before I die I pray (Yup) that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won’t be no fun
If I can’t have you, no one can
