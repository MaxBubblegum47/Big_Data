They called him crazy when they started out
Said seventeen's too young to know what love's about
They've been together fifty-eight years now
That's crazy
He brought home sixty-seven bucks a week
He bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street
Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed
Yeah that's crazy
Just ask him how he did it; he'll say pull up a seat
It'll only take a minute, to tell you everything
Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And 
love like crazy
They called him crazy when he quit his job
Said them home computers, boy they'll never take off
He sold his one man shop to Microsoft
They paid like crazy
Just ask him how he made it, he'll tell you faith and sweat
And the heart of a faithful woman, Who never let him forget
Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy
Always treat your woman like a lady
Never get to old to call her baby
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy
They called him crazy when they started out
They've been together fifty-eight years now
Ain't that crazy?
