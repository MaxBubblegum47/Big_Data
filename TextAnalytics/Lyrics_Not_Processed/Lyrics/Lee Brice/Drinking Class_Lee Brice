We're up when the rooster crows
Clock in when the whistle blows
Eight hours ticking slow
And then tomorrow
We'll do it all over again

I'm a member of a blue collar crowd
They can never, no they can't keep us down
If you gotta, gotta label me
Label me 'proud'

I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us
Raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class

We laugh, we cry, we love
Go hard when the going's tough
Push back on push and shove
Knock us down, we'll get back up again and again

I'm a member of a good timing crowd
We get rowdy, we get wild and loud
If you gotta, gotta label me
Label me proud

I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us
Raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class

We all know why we're here
A little fun, a little music
A little whiskey, a little beer
We going to shake off those long week blues
Ladies, break out your dancing shoes
It don't matter what night it is, it's Friday
It's Saturday, it's Sunday
I just wanna hear you say
I just wanna hear you singing
Y'all Sing it with me

We belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us
Raise your glass
We belong to the drinking class
