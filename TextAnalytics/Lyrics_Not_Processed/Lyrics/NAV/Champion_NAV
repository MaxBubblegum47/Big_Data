[Intro: Travis Scott]
Ballin' like I'm in the NBA
No, these racks cannot see TSA
They found me, now I have to relocate

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott & NAV]
Finna take off on spaceship (Yeah, spaceship)
Dodgin' these hoes like Matrix (Yeah, Matrix)
Ain't fuckin' her 'less she nameless (Yeah)
'Cause the last two was too famous, yeah (Yeah, famous)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & NAV]
We got the trophy like a champion
Fell asleep right on a jet, we gone
Big rings just like a champion
No TSA, hop on a jet, we gone

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Smash out (Out), I call my ho and then I smash out (Out)
I brought my bros, let's get this cash out
Eye in my mind, drop the bag off, bag off, yeah
I'm goin' Tom Brady, ain't made no bad call (Call)
Just bought a new crib, old one was mad small
I triple my cup, I make it mad tall (Tall), mad tall
None of these hoes is basic, yeah
Grease stuck in my teeth like braces, yeah
VVS's, don't need Lasik, yeah
Iced-out crosses, freezin' Satan, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott & NAV]
Finna take off on spaceship (Yeah, spaceship)
Dodgin' these hoes like Matrix (Yeah, Matrix)
Ain't fuckin' her 'less she nameless (Yeah)
'Cause the last two was too famous, yeah (Yeah, famous)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & NAV]
We got the trophy like a champion
Fell asleep right on a jet, we gone
Big rings just like a champion
No TSA, hop on a jet, we gone

[Verse 2: NAV]
Fucked a famous girl to "Mask Off" (Molly, Percocet)
Pop a bean and let the bags talk (Bags talk)
Bought ten bottles on a last call (Last call)
Flew a basic girl out from Alaska
Illegal alien inside my spaceship
Two C's on my shoes, these not no ASICS
Get out my face, my pockets full of faces
Bust down gold AP, that's not no stainless (Yeah)
My Rollie tell me what the day is
I like her 'cause she basic, she got braces
Her followers 100K, then she too famous
If she got a thousand, might make her my main bitch, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott & NAV]
Finna take off on spaceship (Yeah, spaceship)
Dodgin' these hoes like Matrix (Yeah, Matrix)
Ain't fuckin' her 'less she nameless (Yeah)
'Cause the last two was too famous, yeah (Yeah, famous)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & NAV]
We got the trophy like a champion
Fell asleep right on a jet, we gone
Big rings just like a champion
No TSA, hop on a jet, we gone
We got the trophy like a champion
Fell asleep right on a jet, we gone
Big rings just like a champion
No TSA, hop on a jet, we gone

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Ballin' like I'm in the NBA
No, these racks cannot see TSA
They found me, now I have to relocate
