Can’t tell where the sky begins and the water ends
No clouds to hide the sun
Waves playing me a
 symphony upon the sand
As I lay drifting on the ocean with this bottle in my hand
Sat down on the boardwalk for a little while
Your memory my company
Something about this place had a way to make you smile
You always loved the sound of waves
The wind whistling across my bottle still can’t blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won’t be here with me
So I raise it up and toast the day we met
Won’t forget the way you love me, amazing way you love me

[Chorus]
It’s bittersweet, you see
You’re not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face, hold on tight to yesterday
And when I wake, it was just a dream
It’s bittersweet
Doctor said there’s nothing we can do
Took my hand said take me home
To the only place half a chance to take the pain away
Let me feel alive before I go
You said life is only borrowed
So let’s wash away our sorrow
That tomorrow I won’t be here with you
Go and live your life with no regrets and don’t forget how much I love you
I love you

[Chorus]
It’s bittersweet, you see
You’re not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face, hold on tight to yesterday
And when I wake, it was just a dream
It’s bittersweet
I brought you back just like you wanted
So you don’t ever have to leave
And when I poured you across the southern sky, I couldn’t help but to cry
I know you finally got your wings
Bitter-bittersweet
Bittersweet
The wind whistling across my bottle still can’t blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won’t be here with me
So I raise it up and toast the day we met
Won’t forget the way you love me, amazing way you love me
It’s bittersweet
