[Intro: Che Ecru & Drake]
Before I die I'm tryna fuck you, baby
Hopefully we don't have no babies
I don't even wanna go back home
Hopefully, I don't leave you on your own

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy
Trips that you plan for the next whole week
Bands too long for a nigga so cheap
And your flex OD, and your sex OD
You got it, girl, you got it (Ayy)
You got it, girl, you got (Yeah)
Pretty lil' thing, you got a bag and now you wildin'
You just took it off the lot, no mileage
Way they hittin' you, the DM lookin' violent
Talkin' wild, you come around and now they silent
Flew the coop at 17, no guidance
You be stayin' low but you know what the vibes is
Ain't never got you nowhere bein' modest
Poppin' shit but only 'cause you know you're poppin', yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
You got it, girl, you got it (Ayy)
You got it, girl, you got it

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil' baby in her bag, in her Birkin
No nine to five, put the work in
Flaws and all, I love 'em all, to me, you're perfect
Baby girl, you got it, girl, you got it, girl (Oh-oh)
You got it, girl, you got it, girl (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't wanna play no games, play no games
Fuck around, give you my last name (Oh)
Know you tired of the same damn thing
That's okay 'cause, baby, you

[Chorus: Drake, Chris Brown & Both]
You got it, girl, you got it (Oh, ooh, ayy)
You got it, girl, you got it (Got it)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
You the only one I'm tryna make love to, pickin' and choosin'
They ain't really love you, runnin' games, usin'
All your stupid exes, they gon' call again
Tell 'em that a real nigga steppin' in
Don't let them niggas try you, test your patience
Tell 'em that it's over, ain't no debatin' (Uh)
All you need is me playin' on your playlist
You ain't gotta be frustrated

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't wanna play no games, play no games (Oh)
Fuck around, give you my last name (My last name)
Know you tired of the same damn thing (Same damn thing)
That's okay 'cause, baby, you

[Chorus: Drake, Chris Brown & Both]
You got it, girl, you got it (Oh, ooh, ayy)
You got it, girl, you got it (Got it)
I don't wanna

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Che Ecru]
Before I die, I'm tryna fuck you, baby (Yeah)
Hopefully, we don't have no babies (Ooh)
I don't even wanna go back home
Hopefully, I don't leave you on your own
You got it, girl, you got it, oh

[Verse 4: Drake & Chris Brown]
Play no games (No)
Freaky (Freaky)
I can learn a lot from you, gotta come teach me (Woo, woo)
You a lil' hot girl, you a lil' sweetie (No, sweet)
Sweet like Pearland, sweet like Peachtree (Like that)
I can tell you crazy, but shit kind of intrigue me (No, yeah, I like that)
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
Seen it on the 'gram, I'm tryna see that shit in 3D, mami
I know I get around 'cause I like to move freely
(I don't, I don't)
But you could lock it down, I could tell by how you treat me
(I don't, I don't)
I seen how you did homeboy, so please take it easy (No, yeah)
Good to have me on your side, I ain't sayin' that you need me (Yeah, yeah)
Six God talk but I ain't tryna get preachy (No, no, no)
I seen how you did homeboy, please take it easier on me
'Cause I don't wanna (No) play no games, play no games
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
I don't wanna play no games, play no games
(I don't, I don't)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
I don't, I don't
No
