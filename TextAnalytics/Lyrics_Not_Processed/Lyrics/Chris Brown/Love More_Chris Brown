[Intro: Chris Brown]
'Til we get it
I'ma get it
'Til we get it
'Til we get it
I'ma get it
'Til we get it

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You say all you need is consistent love
When I try, I swear it's never enough, I messed up
Maybe this thing here just ain't meant for us
Baby, you let go and I pull you back
I let go, you ain't havin' that

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We do it like rock stars (Oh)
Sexin' in my hotel room and we so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud (Oh)
Shades on, doin' 95 with the top down
I might sound crazy (Oh)
'Cause we be goin' back and forth
One minute I hate you, then I love you
That's how it is

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more
'Til we get it, I'ma get it
I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more
I'ma get it, I'ma get it
'Til we get it, 'til we get it, I'ma get it (Turn up)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Why is it all so complicated?
Baby, this should be simple, it's drivin' me mental
But when you back it up, it really drives me crazy
And you know what I'm into
Make me forget what we arguin' about, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We do it like rock stars (Oh)
Sexin' in my hotel room and we so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud (Oh)
Shades on, doin' 95 with the top down
I might sound crazy (Oh)
'Cause we be goin' back and forth
One minute I hate you, then I love you
That's how it is

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Nicki Minaj]
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more (Oh no)
'Til we get it, I'ma get it
I'ma get it (Ayy), 'til we get it, 'til we get it (We get it right)
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more (More)
I'ma get it, I'ma get it
'Til we get it (Yeah), 'til we get it, I'ma get it (Yo, turn up)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & Chris Brown]
He don't know me but he settin' up to blow me, uh
Said my Twitter picture 'mind him of Naomi, uh
On the low, I used to holla at his homie, uh
Fuck it, now I'm 'bout to ride him like a pony, yeah
Okay, thug prolly, yo, come polly
He wanna fuck a bad Dolly and pop Molly
I hope your pockets got a motherfuckin' pot belly
Or is it that you never ball? John Salley
He had the Rolls in the Royce, the tone in his voice
Don't want a good girl, naw, hoes is his choice
D-D-Dick on H, p-p-p-pussy on W
Mouth on open, a-a-ass on smother you
A-A-Ass on the cover too, Elle Magazine
Vroom, vroom, vroom, get gasoline
Could I be your wife? Naw, we could bang though
I got these niggas whipped, call me Django (If we)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more (Oh-oh)
'Til we get it, I'ma get it
I'ma get it (I'ma get it), 'til we get it, 'til we get it
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more (Some more)
I'ma get it, I'ma get it
'Til we get it (Yeah, yeah, yeah), 'til we get it, I'ma get it
