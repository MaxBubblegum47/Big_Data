[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Know I got a lot, lot

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
I woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Oh, I think they like me, yeah, they like me
Diamonds on me, ice cream, ho, that slightly
My Draco bitch a Spike Lee, diamonds on me biting
I heard these niggas wanna fight me
Meet me at my next show but you better bring a pipe, B
We ain't fighting
I think she like me, exciting, ooh, so exciting
Fuck me, Bentley coupe I'm riding with a thottie, fuck
I just spent a hundred on my watch piece, fuck
I done fell in love with a thottie, fuck
She just wanna fuck me for my clout, fuck
Bitch, I'm off the lean I crash the Audi, fuck
Might just spend 200 on this Audi, truck

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Oh, I think they like me, yeah, in my white tee
Oh, no, no, no, baby, smoke so much dope need some Visine
These young nigga don't like me, but act just like me (Why?)
Fucked all of y'all bitches so they parties don't invite me
That bitch, that's your wifey, she so triflin'
I been gettin' money so don't nothin' really excite me
Carti poured a six in the four of the right lean
Damn, that boy askin' for some more like the Sprite clean
Yeah, that's that dirty, that's that dirty
That girl all up in my face like she ain't tried to swerve me
These boys all up in my lane, I swear they keep on merging
No, I cannot see a lame 'cause my Rolls-Royce got curtains

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
I woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me

[Verse 3: Playboi Carti]
Oh, I think they like me, think she like me
The bitch want to indict me, she can't find me
I'm like dirty up the Sprite please, with some ice please
We pop beans and like to sip lean, oh oh
Xans, Percs, molly, we got hella things
I'm in love with the guap, gave it a wedding ring
And I swear I had these thots before I got the fame
And I swear I had the Glock before I got the chain
I'm in Bompton with Pirus and I don't even bang, yeah (Slatt)
Shoutout G Weed and Yung L, yeah, ho, that the gang
Shoutout GiGi that's my boo, she know that I claim
Shootin' at these niggas like I'm in the paint
Woke up like this

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me, talk
Woke up to niggas soundin' like me, talk
I woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me
I woke up to niggas soundin' like me
Woke up to niggas talkin' like me
