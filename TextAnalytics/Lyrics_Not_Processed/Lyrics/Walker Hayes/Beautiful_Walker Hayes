[Verse 1]
Rode all the way down memory lane where 65 ends
Wonderin’ how it’d feel to see the one that got away again
Hopin’ it might go down like that hometown unanswered prayer
My hero sang about on an old burned CD we shared

[Verse 2]
Somethin' on the interstate told me I was headed straight for your pretty storm
That the hurt was still gonna be there just like your name on my arm
Even got real with a girl I chill with up in Chapel Hill
Told her you were gonna be here just in case my heart was still in Mobile..

[Chorus]
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful

[Verse 3]
Ain’t no tellin’, girl, how long it’s been since we did all that shoutin'
Prolly, 10 months 27 days, somethin’ like that but hey, who’s countin’
Oh, you know, just livin’ the dream, home is where the bus is
I could say time looks fine on you but it wouldn’t do it justice, it wouldn’t do it justice

[Chorus]
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful

[Bridge]
I don’t think your stomach’s supposed to hurt quite like this
When you run into a girl you forgot you missed
It’s like the space between us only made me numb
Thought I could just see you and be okay but I’m not okay girl
Tell me that smile on your face is so fake and that
It’s all comin’ back, comin’ back, comin’ back
I just have to ask, have to ask, have to ask

[Chorus]
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
