[Verse 1]
Well, I got some Coke in my bourbon
Surfin' the room like Swazye
No, I ain't drunk, I'm amazin'
Yeah, I got that laid way, way back, back in my swagger
X-Factor, feelin' no pain, I'm at the top of my game

[Pre-Chorus]
Darlin', you can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't start rainin' on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

[Verse 2]
Guess you don't know what you want
'Til you see 'em movin' on
Making lonely look like freedom
Baby, don't even act like I'm doing something wrong
If my song comes on and I get lost on that dance floor
In somebody's arms that ain't yours

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't start raining on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

[Bridge]
For real, babe, ain't tryin' to rub it your face
I'm just breakin' off a little cold hard truth
It is what it is, girl, you did whatcha did, girl
I'm just doin' what a bachelor do

[Pre-Chorus]
Darlin', you can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't be raining on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me
You broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe?
You broke up with me
