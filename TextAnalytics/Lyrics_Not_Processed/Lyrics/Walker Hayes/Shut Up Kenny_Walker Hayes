[Verse 1]
You gotta be kidding me, Chesney
Every time I turn the ignition
You're on the radio again and in the shotgun of my vision
There she is, where she was, where she's not
Thanks a lot, man
Ain't like my heart needs your help in the breaking department
Yeah, she's already got that taken care of
No offense, but

[Chorus]
Shut up, Kenny
Leave me alone
Keep your songs to yourself
Why you gotta sound just like she felt
When your stuff was the shit we drove around to
And even your sad songs were fun to make out to
C'mon, Kenny
Man, you know I like your music
But I hate the way I love the way it hurts when I listen to it
I know I need to rip the radio out the dash but I can't
Damn
Shut up, Kenny

[Verse 2]
Kenny, please
Hell, even your new tracks hurt
Your voice is like a mean time machine, it only goes backwards
Ain't a station you ain't on, need to change it but I don't really want to
I just keep loving her
And hating you

[Chorus]
Shut up, Kenny
Leave me alone
Keep your songs to yourself
Why you gotta sound just like she felt
When your stuff was the shit we drove around to
And even your sad songs were fun to make out to
C'mon, Kenny
Man, you know I like your music
But I hate the way I love the way it hurts when I listen to it
I know I need to rip the radio out the dash but I can't
Damn
Shut up, Kenny

[Repeat Chorus]

You're on the radio again and in the shotgun of my vision
There she is, where she was, but she's not
Thanks a lot, man
Ain't like my heart needs your help in the breaking department
