[Hook]
Good lookin', so refined
Say wouldn’t you like to know whats going on in my mind?
So let me get right to the point
I don’t pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey Big Spender
Spend, a little time with me

[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
This here is Givenchy, 900 dollar jeans homie
All these girls be raunchy, like let me see your peen homie
She tryna cause a scene, but I'm in Paris with my team
Walking slow like I'm on lean, damn a nigga jewelry look so clean
I occasionally ball in Lanvin, I ain't talking 'bout Jim Jones
Nigga, I'm talking 'bout hooping up, expensive shirt, breaking bones
Fuck yo Rolex, roll up homie, roll that kush, blow that homie
Oh stop that, the po-po on me, pourin' shit out the window
We just getting saucy in Aussie, we bossy
Tryna bring back the term bling bling cause we flossy
You brought snapbacks back, well that's a cool accomplishment
I'm on the other side, on another globe on conference

[Break]
Hey, I just bought a kangaroo and a leather jacket man
I’m coming back to America swaggin' out
Let's go

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck that shit I'm too throwed, pretty nigga my jewels gold
Pinky ring and my tooth gold, your main bitch is my new ho
Boss nigga like Hugo, Rolex or the Hublot
Niggas taking my Screw flow, they tryna jack it like new clothes
Purple drank make me move slow, same shit, different day
Spanish bitch, she sniffing yay, she say (Yuuup!) that Trigga Trey
Like hit that strip, I'm flipping yay, like fuck that shit, I'm getting paid
I fuck that bitch, I'm getting laid, I hope that bitch go different ways
I get 'em wild, I'm get 'em bi, tell 'em roll that shit, I'm getting high
I'm tipping low, I'm sitting high, this young Harlem motherfucker getting fly
Purple lean, purple weed, got that shit, nigga what you need?
Me and Theo had a trio with these bitches from Belize

[Verse 3: Theophilus London]
Fuck that
Home boy, I'm never home, I'm not even in my continent
In a town, I can't pronounce this shit, this is more than confidence
Fuck your continental breakfast, you incompetent
My nickname International, my accent changed by accident
It's Soho House put your phone away, I don't give a fuck who ya protege
I'm from Brooklyn, I fuck with Jay, time to time, I chill with 'Ye
Fans don't mosh, nigga they pause, bitches so fly like "Oh, my gosh"
Yeah, we selling out girls, girls, money yelling out
They planking cause they bored
Nigga need a new hobby, need a new body
You the biter, you the new hottie, you a stylist, wait in my lobby
Nigga dance like Bobby, tryna get like 2 cribs for my mommy
That ain't guac, bitch that's wasabi, tell Rich I'm the face of Tommy
