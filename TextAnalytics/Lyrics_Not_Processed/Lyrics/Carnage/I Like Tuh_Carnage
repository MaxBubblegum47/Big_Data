[Chorus: ILoveMakonnen]
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
I pull up on the scene
Got a pocket full of white and the green
Bitches out of town know what I mean
They're like a song, goddamn we wanna sing
I smoke the best weed in the states
I don't fuck 'round with no fakes
I have to scrape the whole damn plate
I like to go to Steak 'n Shake

[Chorus]
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
I like to roof off in the booth
Had to mix the white with the Goose
Pineapple with a little bit of juice
Your girl over there, you know she gon' choose
We the winners, natural born sinners
Come off in this bitch like, "Yeah what's for dinner?"
Eat these chumps up, and spit 'em back out
I'm the hottest mothafucka in the north and the south now

[Bridge: ILoveMakonnen]
I make money and get turnt
Spend it all at the bank
Put it all on dank
We don't play no games
I like to make money, get turnt
I got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I got my work twerkin' like the lil' white girl
I used to make it all off the white girl, but now I just...

[Chorus]
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work
