[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really, I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say, no, no, no sir
Oh, mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
But baby, don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must go
But baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no, no, no
Aw baby, it's cold outside
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh, your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh, your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby, you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see, no, no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!
