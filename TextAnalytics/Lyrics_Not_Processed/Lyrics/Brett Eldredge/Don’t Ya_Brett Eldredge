[Verse 1]
Girl you cut those jeans just right
I know you didn't buy 'em like that
So baby don't even try that
You dance, Oh you move
Like there ain't nobody watchin'
But girl you know I'm watchin'

[Hook]
Don't lie, you've got it all figured out
That smile has got me spinnin' around
Don't even try actin' like it ain't no thing
Cause I can see you move a little closer, closer
Girl I gotta get to get to know ya, know ya
Everything about ya makes me want ya, want ya
Know what you're doin baby don't ya, don't ya

[Verse 2]
You've been lookin' over here all night
And When I look, you look away
Oh I love the little games you play
Yea I bet you didn't mean to brush my hand when you walked by me
Like you didn't mean to drive me crazy

[Hook]
Don't lie, you've got it all figured out
That smile has got me spinnin' around
Don't even try actin' like it ain't no thing
Cause I can see you move a little closer, closer
Girl I gotta get to get to know ya, know ya
Everything about ya makes me want ya, want ya
Know what you're doin baby don't ya, don't ya

[Bridge]
Wanna get outta here and let me show ya
How good it would feel to hold ya
Put your pretty little head on my shoulder
Oh yea

[Hook]
Don't lie, you've got it all figured out
That smile has got me spinnin' around
Don't even try actin' like it ain't no thing
Cause I can see you move a little closer, closer
Girl I gotta get to get to know ya, know ya
Everything about ya makes me want ya, want ya
Know what you're doin baby don't ya, don't ya
