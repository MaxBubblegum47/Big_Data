[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
This is such a perfect place
I'm glad I found this with you
Our love reflected in your face
Only Heaven can beat this view

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Come on, let's run and get lost in the crowd
Into the light as the night's comin' down
I'm double-tappin', I'm focusin' now
We're focusin' now

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I see love
I see love around me
From a river to a flood
I see love around me (Love around me)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
I love you, helped me find my heart
I didn't even know my name
Then I was blinded by the dark
My eyes will never look the same

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Come on, let's run and get lost in the crowd
Into the light as the night's comin' down
I'm double-tappin', I'm focusin' now
We're focusin' now

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I see love
I see love around me
From a river to a flood
I see love around me (Love around me)
I see love
I see love
From a river to a flood
I see love around me (Love around me)

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Come on, let's run and get lost in the crowd
Into the light as the night's comin' down
I'm double-tappin', I'm focusin' now
We're focusin' now

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I see love
I see love around me
From a river to a flood
I see love around me (Love around me)
I see love
I see love
From a river to a flood
I see love around me

[Outro: Joe Jonas]
I see love
