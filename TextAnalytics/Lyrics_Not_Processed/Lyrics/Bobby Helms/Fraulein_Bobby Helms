[Verse 1]
Far across deep blue waters, lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her, but I can't forget her
I miss my pretty Fraulein

[Chorus]
Fraulein, Fraulein, walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holdin' mine
By the same stars above you, I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein

[Verse 2]
When my memories wander, away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory, a face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein

[Chorus]
Fraulein, Fraulein, walk down by the river
Pretend your hand's holdin' mine
By the same stars above you, I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
