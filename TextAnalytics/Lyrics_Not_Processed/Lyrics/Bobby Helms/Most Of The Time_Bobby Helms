Most of the time I'm lyin' here crying
I think oh how nice it would be
If we both would be back together
And forget the troubles that have set us free
I think of doing things but I'd be sorry
Bout trying to find somebody new
I think of lots of things to ease my sorrow
But most of the time I think of you
Most of the time I'm lyin' here wondering
If maybe you're out with someone new
You wouldn't if you knew how much it hurts me
When I think that someone else is holding you
Most of the time I'm so lonely
The rest of the time I'm so blue
Part of my time I spend in slumber
But most of the time I think of you
