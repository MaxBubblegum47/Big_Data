I got a gal and she sure looks classy
Smooth as a car with a fiberglass chassis
Spicy as a magazine and twice as sassy

When we're alone it's a big temptation
To try for a kid that's a real sensation
She's the got the keys to the situation
Jacquie, you're the one for me

My baby doll is a real humdinger
She likes to dance to the [?]
And when she rocks she's a real life swinger
Jacquie, you're the one for me

My Jacqueline (Badum)
My heart belongs to you (Badum, Badum)
My Jacqueline (Badum)
Oh won't you say you love me too
Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, Jacqueline
