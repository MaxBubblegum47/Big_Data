[Verse]
Four hours of climbing to the wildest heights
We saw all the sights
And I hope to colour in all these lines
That were drawn through the night
I don't even know her name to call her
It was one of the nights that will stay forever

[Chorus]
Just wake me up, before the sun
Delivers the light
I want your eyes to follow mine
And say you will remember
Just wake me up, before the sun
Delivers the light
I want your eyes to follow mine
And say you will remember

[Bassline]
And say you will remember

[Chorus]
Just wake me up, before the sun
Delivers the light
I want your eyes to follow mine
And say you will remember
Just wake me up, before the sun
Delivers the light
I want your eyes to follow mine
And say you will remember

[Chorus]
Just wake me up, before the sun
Delivers the light
I want your eyes to follow mine
And say you will remember

[Bassline]
And say you will remember
