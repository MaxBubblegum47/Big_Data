[Verse 1]
I apologize but this time I don't need help
Another heavy but tears will dry themselves
I'm breaking free from the chains inside the cell
Waking up to better versions of myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Better, better, better version of myself
Better, better, better version of myself
Better, better, better version of myself
Of my self

[Chorus]
Better
Better
Better
Better versions of myself, of myself
Better
Better
Better
Better versions of myself, of myself

[Verse 2]
I recognize that a journey never ends
You think it's over but then it all starts again
My fellow students that came along with you
My love's so empty from fighting my way to here

[Pre-Chorus]
Better, better, better version of myself
Better, better, better version of myself
Better, better, better version of myself
Of my self
Better, better, better version of myself
Better, better, better version of myself
(Better, better, better)
(Of my self)

[Chorus]
Better
Better
Better
Better versions of myself, of myself
Better
Better
Better
Better versions of myself, of myself
