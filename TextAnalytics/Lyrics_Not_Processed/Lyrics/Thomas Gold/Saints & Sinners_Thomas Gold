[Verse 1]
Come on, tell me what I am
And come on, tell me where I stand
You know I tried and I tried and I tried
To let it be the truth
But then you go, then you go, then you go
And you saying something new

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we are saints and we are sinners
And we are lost and we are found
And we are hopeless from a distance
But we are stronger, we are

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And we are saints and we are

[Verse 2]
Come on, tell me where to go
And come on, tell me what you know
You know I tried and I tried and I tried
To let it be the truth
But then you go, then you go, then you go
And you saying something new

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we are saints and we are sinners
And we are lost and we are found
And we are hopeless from a distance
But we are stronger, we are

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And we are saints and we are sinners
And we are saints and we are sinners
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
We are drowning holding our breath now we're counting
Oh, we are saints and we are sinners
Yeah we are saints and we are

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And we are saints and we are sinners
And we are saints and we are
And we are saints and we are sinners
And we are saints and we are sinners
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And we are saints and we are sinners
Yeah we are saints and we are
