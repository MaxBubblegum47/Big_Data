[Verse 1]
I believe in pressing diamonds from the sand
I can feel the touch of Midas in my hands
And I carry it wherever I go
I'm depending on the angels by my side
I've been having conversations with the sky
And I call on them when I get low

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you were me, you'd be living the way I do
I don't get high 'cause I'm already on my roof

[Chorus]
So don't wake a dreamer
Got my head in the clouds
Where the Gods can hear me out
Don't wake a dreamer
Reaching for gold
That's all I know

[Verse 2]
I've been dancing with the sinners and the saints
Underneath it are we naked and the same
And we dance again whenever we want
I've been rising like a Phoenix from the past
See my colors burning brighter in the ash
And they catch a flame when I'm in the dark

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If you were me, you'll be sky walking in my shoes
Tip toe the tight rope between the sun and the moon

[Chorus]
So don't wake a dreamer
Got my head in the clouds
Where the Gods can hear me out
Don't wake a dreamer
Reaching for gold
That's all I know

[Bridge]
I don't see reality
I escape to a place I call home
I don't bleed red like you
I escape to a higher place
That's why you

[Chorus]
So don't wake a dreamer
Got my head in the clouds
Where the Gods can hear me out
So don't wake a dreamer
Reaching for gold
That's all I know
Don't wake a dreamer
Reaching for gold
That's all I know
So don't wake a dreamer
