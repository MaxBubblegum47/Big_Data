[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' good, I'm a bad bitch (Ah)
I'm sick of motherfuckers tryna tell me how to live (Fuck y'all)
Wack hoes hate under my pictures on the 'Gram (Ugh)
Bitch, you better hope I never run across your man, uh

Somebody call Rihanna, I'ma buy some drawers with him
He fuckin' with Thee Stallion 'cause he into wild women (He love wild women)
Put them legs on his head, now he love tall women (Yeah, yeah, ah)
You'll never catch me callin' these niggas daddy (Nope)
I ain't lyin' 'bout my nut just to make a nigga happy (Nigga, please)
Lifestyle when a nigga can't fit a Magnum
It never happened if the dick wasn't snappin' (Ayy, woo)

I'ma make him eat me out while I'm watchin' anime (Wow, wow, anime)

One night with him make him lose it like a prom date (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)
Two watches, yeah, call me two-timin' (Two-timin')

Thirty-inch weave with the long eyelashes (Blah, long eyelashes)

I don't stand outside 'cause I'm too outstandin' (Ah)
