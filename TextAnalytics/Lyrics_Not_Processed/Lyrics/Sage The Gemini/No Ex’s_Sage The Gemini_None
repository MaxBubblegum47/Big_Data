[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
I don't got no ex's
I don't got no ex's
All I care for is this necklace
All I care for is this necklace
I don't got no ex's
I don't got no ex's
All I care for is this necklace
All I care for is this necklace

[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
Ayy, ayy
Bitch, don't ask me who I be on
I'm just tryna hit it with my Gucci on
Netflix and chill, put this movie on
I'm the one that asked, Bubaka to put me on
Neck, wrist, neck, wrist, neck, wrist
Commas on me everywhere, take a breath, bitch
This was layin' on the floor, I regret this
Still look better than your nigga in his best shit
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch said I go
Don't get mad at me, y'all need to talk when y'all get home
Psh, don't involve me in that shit
All these diamonds in my Rollie, don't got time for this shit
Okay, I been single since birth
Okay, she used to fuck with me
No way, what you do for me
Always got my own cheese
I don't know how you think this okay
Bitch

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
I don't got no ex's
I don't got no ex's
All I care for is this necklace
All I care for is this necklace
I don't got no ex's
I don't got no ex's
All I care for is this necklace
All I care for is this necklace

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
I don't got no ex-bitch
I don't read no texts, I still could get the message
Whole circle taking Ls
Like the logo on the Lexus, molly, not no Xs
All my bitches sexy
Me and my lil crew done came in strapped, I'm riding Xs
Now we riding Mazi and your ho ain't got no access
I ride around protected, reckless
I hit your bitch, now that bitch feel neglected
Cases out in Texas
My label pay for lawyers and the sessions
Patchwork, patching up my flesh, bitch
War rooms from when I trapped from Candler 'til I flex, bitch
Did it off the top like a young nigga, restless
Flexing, chicken like Zaxby's
Grape Street shit, nothing sweet like raspberries
She wanna fuck, tell a bitch don't ask me
I put that dick in her mouth like a weapon

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
I don't got no ex's
I don't got no ex's
All I care for is this necklace
All I care for is this necklace
I don't got no ex's
I don't got no ex's
All I care for is this necklace
All I care for is this necklace
