[Intro]
(Ho-ho-ho-ho-holy shit)

[Verse 1]
Uh, I got a bad girl let me bang like Kurt Co
Take 'em down, take 'em down to the first floor
Hoes waitin for a nigga on pluto
So why on earth would I be waitin' on you for?
I got a bad girl like everyday
Night time, mouth look like a sunny day
I'm in a new whip switchin' every other lane
While you walkin down the street switchin every other way
'Tryna find a nigga
But I better drive past you was raw out
Talkin' 'bout 'How long did it last?'
They want it bad and you know it don't you
But you know I got cash to put on it don't you -
Bitch

[Hook]
"Yeah you're bad and you know it don't you
She always say 'Boy you know I don't want you' (want you)
You're bad and you know it don't you
Now you're single and you're bad and you know it, don't you
But it's good
You're bad and you know it don't you, (woah, woah, woah)
She always say 'Boy you know I don't want you' (want you)
You're bad and you know it don't you
Now you're single and you're bad and you know it, don't you
But it's good."

[Verse 2]
Umm
I'm 'bout to do me some bad girls heavy man
Still 'tryna get a girl from the seventh grade
It's like 'Damn why you teasin' me?'
Nice shape, and her face is Alicia Keys - yikes!
But I ain't trippin', there's bigger fishes to reel in
Relationships, but when does the 'real' come in?
Sleepin' on me like when does the pill kick in?
Been thuggin and it's over like Dave's shit, man
I been 'tryna make it better for your life
And you know I'm 'finna ask you out for dinner tonight
You lay back and enjoy it, don't you
But you know I got racks to put on it, don't you -
Bitch

[Hook]
"Yeah you're bad and you know it don't you
She always say 'Boy you know I don't want you' (want you)
You're bad and you know it don't you
Now you're single and you're bad and you know it, don't you
But it's good
You're bad and you know it don't you, (woah, woah, woah)
She always say 'Boy you know I don't want you' (want you)
You're bad and you know it don't you
Now you're single and you're bad and you know it, don't you
But it's good."
