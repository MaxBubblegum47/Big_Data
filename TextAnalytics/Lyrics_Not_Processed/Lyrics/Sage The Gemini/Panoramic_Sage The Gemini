[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
Oh, how you do that
I'm trying to pursue that
Drop it down on a nigga do damage
Booty moving left to right, it's panoramic
Panoramic, it's panoramic, panoramic, it's panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic
Panoramic, it's panoramic, panoramic, it's panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic

[Verse 1: D-Mac]
Get it, get it, get it, get it
She popping and dropping it
Only dancing for that profit
Shake it faster than an ostrich
I'll rock it, sock it, bop it
Bend it over I'ma show you how a real nigga gon' do
Beat it down like a rumble when I'm done make you stumble
Then we go crazy let me see them hips twirl
Put you on my shoulders do some shit to make your toes curl
Earthquake drill 'cause I'm gonna rock your world
Had her tapping out legs shaking like a snow globe
Had her on them crutches
Causing up a ruckus
Call me hammer time 'cause my style, you can't touch this
Want to make music
Blow, blow me like a trumpet
Her sister hold her hand so she backed it up and dumped it
She a bad little yomper
Booty soft like some pampers on my lap
Like I'm finna beat it up
Kung Fu Panda
On the pole like a stripper
Shake it fast off the Richter
Bend that ass over, throw it at me like a pitcher
D-mac

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
Oh, how you do that
I'm trying to pursue that
Drop it down on a nigga do damage
Booty moving left to right, it's panoramic
Panoramic, it's panoramic, panoramic, it's panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic
Panoramic, it's panoramic, panoramic, it's panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic

[Verse 2: Show Banga]
Uh uh owa
Drop it down on a man panoramic, owa
I'm a ramic owa
Do some damage owa
That ass a perfect picture Instagram it owa
Finna fuck up the game I'ma spam it owa
And dig I read all of my tricks
But you leave your girl around
Then she is gonna get free
Now I got her at the crib
Showing me how she freak
I robbed more at the peak
She a cold by the shnick
Freak of the week
Freak of the lick
You know I get it wet
Making making you leak
Give you the best
There's no way to compete
Face down ass up
Now show me them cheeks
Move it around do it just like a stripper
And now I want to dance
I want to put down my zipper
If I sip a little liquor
I might just lick her
If I get her backstage
Then you know I'ma stick her
And know I

[Chorus: Sage the Gemini]
Oh, how you do that
I'm trying to pursue that
Drop it down on a nigga do damage
Booty moving left to right, it's panoramic
Panoramic, it's panoramic, panoramic, it's panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic
Panoramic, it's panoramic, panoramic, it's panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic
Drop it down on a nigga, panoramic
