[Intro]
Big Shaq
Hold tight man like James St. Patrick
Kanan, Tommy
Carbon Monoxide, Dioxide
Oi, Potassium, I see you
Man's out here putting in the work

[Verse]
Boom
One, two, three four five
Once I caught a fish alive
Six, seven, eight nine ten
Then I let it go again
And again and again, then that fish went pen
I saw Keisha, I saw Ken, he was holding a skeng
Under his skirt, he called it kilt
Big man, I don’t kill
Holding my drink, it got spilt, that was coconut milk
Man I go, ching-ching-ching for the ching Ford
See your ex in Bedford, hold tight man like Pickford
Duck man down in dat Ford (Ford-Ford-Ford)
I went Barking, couldn't find parking, kinda jarring
Had the .44 long like biscuit, 'fore bed I drink Nesquik
Yeah, yeah, man’s black, my hair is black
Tracksuits black, your girl is back
She's got a back, she is clapped
Your girl is clapped, your sister's clapped
What is that? Round of applause
(Clap, clap, clap)

[Outro]
You dunkno, don't let the celebrity tie thang fool you, for man's out here for real
You get me? In the jungle for real
Hold tight the mandem you don' know who you are
Free youngun Asznee, soon home
Skutnu, I see You
You dunkno, Chingwu
Kr-krt, brtaka-boom
Skitikin, pah-pah
