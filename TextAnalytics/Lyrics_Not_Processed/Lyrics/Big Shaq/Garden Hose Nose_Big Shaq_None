He passed me the pumpy (pew)
Head shaped like Humpty (Dumpty)
You're chasing Clout Gang, it was your only wish (greazmon)
Now your views are down, you're sleeping with IceJJFish (the fishmon)
LA changed you (it did)
You think you're nice (nice)
But everyone knows

You missed the old days when you were banging Mills off of sticky note pranks (pew pew) (you miss em tho)
Shoutout Alboe (my bruddas)

You left for the clout and it hasn't been the same since the day you cut (sk skkrt)
Your Hairline crooked (jeez)
No matter where you cut (facts)
Swazey Baby (not my brudda)
Get sniped like a pro (pew)
Basketball Vids and Reactions, it's getting old (brrrr)
Go wherever Wolfie goes but you're not on payroll (pew)
How you gunna drop the same Vlog, it's a couple days old (pew pew)

[Verse 4: ChadWithaJ]
Wolfie is a soft man (soft)
Looks like a big baby
This man should be saying
Team Alboe made me
Let's talk about Swazey
Swazey is a Uckers
By your side like a ting man
Eyy, but that doesn't shock us
Used to bench three plates
Now you weight three plates (jheeze)
No more Postmates (nope)
I can see it in your face (like come on man)
Wolfie needs Rice
Wolfie needs Banks (and Alissa)
He can't film a viral without them so he better say thanks
