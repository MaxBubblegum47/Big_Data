- Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on! You know who really needs to be in this Rewind video? Everyone who managed to do something bigger than themselves this year. Who found a way to help the causes that matter to them most
- To everyone who proved it's ok to talk about mental health this year, and showing our viewers that it's ok to go through tough times like that
- It takes a lot of bravery to be that vulnerable and I'm so proud of this community
- I think this year's Rewind should celebrate the fierce, fabulous and empowering art of drag
- I want to see all of you be your own kind of beautiful
- And to those people who have raised money in the field of education
- 
Can we also give a moment to Asian representation in entertainment this year?
- Major strides were made
- And to the people who put aside their differences
- Yeah, and created something really special
- Here's to all women in 2018 finding their voices
- 
Foi muito bacana ver como as mulheres cresceram este ano, elas ganharam poder
- Can we give a moment to working moms?
- Let's do it
- E a todo mundo que ensinou
- Ou que aprendeu alguma coisa nesse ano
- And to all the refugees and anyone looking for a home
- Todos nosotros deberíamos enviarles un saludo a los niños que siguen sus sueños
- Yo quiero agradecer a toda la comunidad que siempre apoya en buenas y malas
- Kita adalah keluarga
- Kita adalah tim
- Family is everything
- I want to give a moment to everyone who supported me when I got sick
- All of the comments and messages I got made me feel like I wasn't alone
- We're forgetting something
- I think we should read the comments
- Yeah I have a feeling this is going to get a little bit crazy
- Let's give the people what they want
I said I like it like that, I like it like that
Had to have high, high hopes
I said I like it like that, that, that
Diamond district in the chain, chain
Certified, you know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang
Had to have high, high hopes (Drop the top and blow the brains)
Always had high, high hopes (Oh, he's so handsome, what's his name?)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Always had high, high hopes
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes for a living (Lately, I've been)
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling (I've been thinking, I want you to be happier)
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo
Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo
I want you to be happier
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
