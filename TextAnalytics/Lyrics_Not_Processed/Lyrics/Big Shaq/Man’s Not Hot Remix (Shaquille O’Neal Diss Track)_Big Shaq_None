Man come from the UK, man squadeded up
Squaded up, you dun know

You think you're bad 'cause your knees are made of steel? Ha
But you're not, you're moist
Man's seen your armpit dripping
In the changing room
Yeah, alright, cool, uh

[Verse]
They call you Big Shaq
But you're not Big Shaq
And your teeth bear plaque
Mine no plaque
You're just wack
Cut some slack
Look at your back
It's just black
I'm thin
I don't sing
Man heard you sing
Ring-a-ding-ding
Phone goes ping

Look at your toenails
They're black
Mouth is white
Like crack
You don't want to see me
In the lab
Man hit your head
Like slab

Man's just got me in the booth
Fresh off the dome, yo
