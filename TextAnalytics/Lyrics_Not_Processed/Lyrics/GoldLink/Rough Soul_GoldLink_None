[Intro]
Uh-uhm-uhm
Yeah

[Verse 1: GoldLink]
Had to go to LA for the winter
Had to vibe out, Just caught a charge had to hideout
Real nigga talk slick to ya
Told ya bring your girlfriend, tell her bring her friends too
Tell me Hollywood kinda weird
You don't really like it but you gotta play the biz
Yeah met ya last June
By next June we were all in love and wanna fuck now
Fell in love at the wrong time
Spent a night at my high rise
Or hit me late on my hotline
Telling me you miss my homies and your mama cry
Late night you're my boo thing, yeah
Your mercedes with the blue tint, yeah
All praise to the most high leader
Dipped off in the Hills wouldnâ€™t wanna be ya

[Hook: April George]
Girl you're gone now
And oh baby
Don't call me, don't call me no more
Girl you're gone now
And oh baby
Don't call me, don't call me no more

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Went back to the homeland
Had to tell the niggas what I did in your hometown
Everybody know we probably woulda made it last
But there you go, started tripping never hit me back
Real nigga went back to the pimping
Started getting groovy with the women I was hitting
Got a gold chain and a nose ring
And a new watch, no tick but I always do time, yeah
Black boy with a black fade, yeah
Got mad when you did things
You was fucking and you did dirt too
We was talking but you never hear my phone boo
Moved up and I feel good shit
Roll palm trees and I made a hit for ya
Billboards around the city with your face on it
But they never ever really know bout what you been through
Stay asking where the hoes at, huh?
Why your homies gotta go there, huh?
I ain't trip when I see you I would dance at a show back in Feb
But you trip and we don't talk much
Girl you got me fucked up
Real nigga gotta get it when he fucked up
Fake niggas like a new man
Just a little side joint
Always been a side joint
Alright joint

[Hook: April George & GoldLink]
Girl you're gone now
And oh baby
Don't call me, don't call me no more
Girl you're gone now
And oh baby
Don't call me, don't call me no more

[Hook: April George & GoldLink]
Girl you're gone now
And oh baby
Don't call me, don't call me no more
Girl you're gone now
And oh baby
Don't call me, don't call me no more
