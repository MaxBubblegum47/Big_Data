[Verse 1]
I don't really say this that often
But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

[Verse 2]
Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losin', but I'm losin' my mind
Does anybody know what that's like?

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

[Bridge]
Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me
Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
If I'm there, you owe me

[Drop]
Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me
(If I'm dead, if I'm dead, if I'm dead, you owe me)

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me
