[Verse 1]
We ah sip the Henny for the day baby
Bad man, we no stray baby
Oops I done fell for your way baby
I know girl but, everyone falls...

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know from the first time, the first time

Even though girl I know that I will fall for you
You got to know that everyone falls
Oops I done fell so deep baby
Oops I want you for me baby
Oops I want you for me baby
Oops I done fell so deep cause...

Everyone falls in love sometimes

Neefi let me love you, love you, love you for long time baby
Neefi let me touch you, neefi let me love you 'til the morning, oh

We ah sip that Henny for the day baby
Come my, my way baby

Out of town, one night teaser
Need to tell them other niggas ease up

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know from the first time, the first time
I seen your love, you got me baby
Even though girl I know that I will fall for you
You got to know that everyone falls
Oops I done fell too deep baby
Oops I think you got me baby
Oops I want you for me baby
