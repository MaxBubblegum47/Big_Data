[Intro: Chris Brown]
Take you down
What I'm about
Take you down
What I'm about
Take you down
I really wanna take you down
And show you what I'm about
Can I take you down?
Your body, body, oh
Your body, body up and down

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I'm gonna put you in seven positions for seventy minutes, you get it, babe
You got a lot on your mind, and I wanna ease it up and lick it and slip it in
You do a light scream on that ice cream when I scoop it and dip it in
Unzippin' the tight jeans and that feminine hygiene is magnificent
Tryna show you, girl, I'm different
I get to lickin', and stickin', and lickin', and stickin' it
'Til the pussy get too wet and it's drippin'
And splittin' both them legs like dividends
If it ends up how I want it, then you'll end up sittin' all over my bottom lip, baby
The feelin' of fuckin' you, feelings all up in you
Make it hard for you to bottle 'em, baby
This dick is too big just to swallow it, baby
But still you do it like it's Thanksgiving
And you gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', baby
Like what's a goon to a goblin, baby?
That pussy hotter than the summer June in Metropolis, baby
No hidin' it, baby
She know what it is when I come around
Let me take you down

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & 
Tory Lanez
]
It ain't my first time, but baby girl, let's get it in, yeah (
Let it's get in, yeah
)
Bump and grind, already know (
Already know, oh
)
I wanna take you down again (
Take you down again
)
Hit that rewind button, oh-oh (
Oh-oh
)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & 
Tory Lanez
]
Now let me take you down
Really wanna take you down, you down, you down (Ooh)
Take you down (
I do
), right now (
Right now
)
You know I know how (Oh-woah)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Come put that shit all on top of me, baby
I'm the one they feelin', so they copy me, baby
Got it copywritten, that's my property, baby
And the way that she whip it, it's drivin' me crazy (Huh)
Think I've been hittin' the lottery, baby
Buy you a Wraith, I'ma give you my safe
Put you in apartments, you parkin' in places
Yeah, that's the real-life Monopoly, baby
We got all night to get it right, babe
So let me play
We got our whole damn life, baby
So here we are, all alone in this room
Girl, you know what I came to do
Know you got me on your radio playin', old school CB
It's just me and you

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & 
Tory Lanez
]
It ain't my first time, but baby girl, let's get it in, yeah (Oh-woah, 
we don't need
)
Bump and grind, already know (
You already know
)
I wanna take you down again (
Oh-woah
)
Hit that rewind button, oh-oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown & 
Tory Lanez
]
Now let me take you down
Really wanna take you down (
I wanna take you down
), you down, you down (Ooh)
Take you down, right now (
Right now
)
You know I know how (
I know how
), ooh

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
Ooh, yeah, love
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe (You know I)
And promise you won't give it to nobody, babe (Know I)
And promise when you promise, keep them promises (Yeah, yeah)
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe (Ooh, woah)
And promise you won't give it to nobody, babe (Oh)
And promise when you promise, keep them promises (Woah)
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe (If you feel me, let me hear you say)
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And promise you won't give it to nobody, babe (Ooh)
And promise when you promise, keep them promises (Woah)
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe (Keep your promises)
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe
And promise you won't give it to nobody, babe
And promise when you promise, keep them promises
