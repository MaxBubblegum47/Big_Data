[Intro]
Sound M.O.B

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Woo!
I'm on my way to an island and I'm poppin' shit at the pilot (Fly shit only)
Niggas be broke and be starvin' but still talkin' shit like they violent (Niggas is broke!)
They said that they honest, talk money, these niggas gon' say that they got it (Huh?)
Gettin' out with the key to success and these niggas gon' blame it on Khaled
They don't wanna see you win (They don't!)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (No!)
You don't wanna see your bitch caught up in the stars like she outer space
Mansion at the condo, condo at the mansion, and I'm runnin' out of space
Tell your homie, keep on comin' out his mouth, I'm sendin' somethin' 'round his way (Brrt)
Niggas barely getting lawyer money (Woo)
Better get some Sig Sauer money
Running 'round like you Superman, don't be selfish, get your mom insurance money (Ha!)
Woo, 'cause I'm the one to put it on your money
I'm the one that make it happen it to you niggas, would you fuck around and do it for me?

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad (We lit)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Feature money out the safe, went and brought a Wraith, brought it down Collins
Niggas talkin' like they want it, when we in the city, they don't want problems
Niggas said they gon' rob us
But nigga, we comin' from welfare
I shoot a mullet when I pull it, how you catch a bullet like a NFL player?
Should've known it was litty when bitches start lyin' on my dick
Lie on that pussy like I hit
Can't even be a side, side bitch
I'm hittin' 9s, 10s, and you ain't even looking like you a 5
Broke bitches tryna do it for Twitter, when they used to do it for Vine, woah!
I'm the man of the hour, I'm the nigga with the airtime
Rolls Royce Wraith, put your bitch up in the stars like she in the airline
Niggas talkin' 'bout my hair line, I laugh about it, I be feelin' them
See, we both be making M's: they be makin' memes, I be makin' millions
I just counted up a Quentin Miller
A "QM," that's a quarter milli
They don't wanna see Jae drop "6," fly private when he go to Philly
Funny money, yeah I know it's silly, but your ho feel me
When I pull up and I got a pour a whole four on it
I promise she gon' know it's litty, motherfucker, yeah

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad (We lit)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
All of my niggas is way up
These niggas is haters, I know that they haters (Suckers)
I score your bitch like a layup (Score)
I make a mil' like a layup (More)
I pop a pill just to stay up (Woo)
I sip the lean just to slow it up (Slow it up)
I'm with my team, and we goin' up (Goin' up)
All of these foreigns, they know it's us (Ah!)
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Like the coca when we mix the soda up (Whip it)
Perfect timin' and we're blowin' up (Blowin' up)
Fuck it, I'ma light the Rollie up (Rollie up)
Shorty fuckin' for Chanel!
I ain't trippin', that's a coconut (Coconut)
Push the 'Rari 'til the motor bust
Stack the paper, fill the sofa up (Woo)
Lay on that paper, I am not slackin', I stay on that paper
I feel like it's a restraining order on that money, 'cause y'all stay away from that paper
I know some niggas that used to be ballin', but know they all feeling a way 'bout this paper
I be spending hundred, hundred, hundred after hundred
They thought I was makin' this paper!
Fuckin' it good, I be rapin' this paper
Shit, I might as well get married to money
I marry Nicki, still married to money
She rich as Mariah, I carry the money
And fuck a deposit, I bury the money (Bury them M's)
I bag the money, it hang out my pocket, embarrassin' money
I act like I ain't used to havin' this money, oh!

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad
They don't wanna see the Wraith
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again
