[Verse: Saweetie]
YSL clutch bag, boss niggas love that
My weave real long, do my squats so that ass fat
Love my attitude so he call me lil’ brat, brat
He love me long time
Cause his cash
Yeah I match that
Never took a L, lesson learned, and I bounced back
Tripping off a nigga, man for what? I just fall back
I don’t have the time to be giving out my time
Haters tryna dim my light, cause they know I’m ‘bout to shine
When they say I’m not hot, now you know you niggas lying
Tell your man get off my dick, he keep trying to hit my line
I don’t share niggas, I just spare niggas
The type that’s not for now, but you keep ‘em just incase nigga
I don’t tweet niggas, I deceive niggas
Tell ‘em face to face, carry on and proceed nigga
Been a real life, never been a make believe
And I’m sticking with my squad, to the top is where we be
New bitches tryna grab lunch, nah that ain’t for me
You ain’t starve with me nigga, so why be there when I eat
Moving mean with my team, in the crib is where we be
Yeah, you barely see us out, cause we plotting up our scheme
You might see us in the spring, taking spots, wait and see
If you ain’t rocking with us now, don’t expect to get a seat
Nigga!

And that's why I gotta keep a ratchet, bad bitch
Work two jobs and gets taxes
Bought a new Glock, hold 30 like a plasma
All she want is two things backshots and a backrub
And oh I, oh I
I'm that nigga that will do that
You know I can't lie
Love the way that you move that
You know I, know I get that check and run through that
Got one clip, two clips
Niggas know I keep two straps

[Hook: Yhung T.O.]
And that's why I'm so anti, anti
Can't trust these bitches no cannot, cannot, oh
And I, and I, always keep some shooters on standby, standby, no
