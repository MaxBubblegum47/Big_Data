[Intro: Mulatto]
Big 'Latto, big remix (
Bankroll Got It

[Chorus: Mulatto]
I throw that ass back to see if he gon' catch it (I throw it)
I ain't athletic, but it's tennis for the necklace, yeah (Ice, ice)
Ayy, where that cash at? I stack it like Tetris (Okay)
Real gutta bitch, real plugs and connections (Real bitch)
First I make him eat it 'til he lockjaw (Yeah)
Give it to him good, knock a nigga socks off, uh (Yeah)
I run it up, they busy running they mouth (Run it, run it)
I'm a real-ass, rich-ass bitch from the Souf, yeah, yeah (Uh, uh, Souf)

[Verse 1: Mulatto]
First off, I ain't fuckin' for no clout (Nah)
I ain't fuckin' on no nigga sleepin' on his patna couch (What the fuck?)
He wanna fuck, rather sit it on his mouth (Uhh)
I'm a freak-ass, street-ass, bitch from the Souf (Haa)
Is you gon' catch it? Eat it up for breakfast? (Yeah)
I ain't athletic on the dick, I do gymnastics (Okay)
I hit up Saweetie like, "What's up? I'm in The Bay" (The Bay)
The baddest bitch in MIA said I'm good when I'm in Dade (Uh)

[Chorus: Mulatto & 
Saweetie

[Verse 2: Saweetie]

Bitches foul and run they mouth, I'ma have to call a tech (Brr)
Black Rapunzel with the bundles got 'em flowin' down my back (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
You know Saweetie get love from the office to the trap (Uh-huh)
Rich niggas want me (Want me), big figures on me (Uh-huh)
Got a snowflake 'round my neck lookin' like a whole thing
Fuck around and catch a cold, bussin' hoes I don't sneeze ('Choo)
Johnny brighten up my smile, he my dentist low-key
Why these hoes testin' me? (Mm-mm) I ain't no fuckin' ACT (I ain't)
You need to do what you just took and that's a fuckin' SAT (Ho)

Yo' man just bought you a Rollie, I'm on my third bust down AP (Whew), ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Saweetie]
I throw that ass back to see if he gon' catch it (Better catch it)

[Verse 3: Trina]
I throw it, he catch it like Odell, it's wet and the pussy got no smell
Can't come to my residence, leavin' no evidence, meet me at the hotel
He said "You don't respect me, you just want a check", he know me so well
I don't fuck with no losers or liars, I ain't takin' no Ls
Nice waist on me (Yeah), yo' nigga wanna taste on me (Ahh)
Nigga, don't FaceTime my line, just come put face on me (Yuh)
Got M's in a Swiss offshore, that's why all my shit cost more
Got my sauce right and it's off-white, can't get it at the store (Hahaha), now watch how

[Chorus: Mulatto]
I throw that ass back to see if he gon' catch it (I throw it)
I ain't athletic, but it's tennis for the necklace, yeah (Ice, ice)
