[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Can't stop, ain't stop, too hot
Came out like the daughter of Aaliyah and 2Pac
And I pop from the jump, ain't nobody too shocked
And I'm out collectin' Rollies, you save up for G-Shocks
Got a bag from the label, I invested and I flipped that
I should write a book on how I mothafuckin' did that
Everything I put in, I get right back
Got long money, I ain't in it for a quick stack
And if she ever had me bent, I don't know who she is
Switchin' sides on me, just know that I know where you live
And I ain't never had to bang, I'm good wherever I is
And I got brothers that'll run it up and handle my biz
Man, I've been hot since a teen when they gave me the key
To the city, fuck around, they'll have to crown me the queen
Yeah, I'm blessed and highly favored to be livin' my dreams
And now they layin' out the carpets when I step on the scene
I drop a bag when I shop, all that extra shit
I'm payin' all my family's bills, that's a flex and shit
Ha, I'm your fave's favorite, that ain't ever changin', bitch
Just bought the Porsche, you can catch me out here swangin' it
Got a second phone and your boyfriend be ringin' it
Got a little lion in me, I ain't ever tamin' shit
Hah, hyphy, hater, you can fight me
Yeah, I beat the odds so I don't take that talkin' lightly
Fuck around and make your girl my wifey
Pearl face diamond on the bezel, keep it icy

[Interlude: Kehlani]
Ayy, check me out, I'm not even a fuckin' rapper
Saweetie goin' fuckin' crazy, Oakland to Sac', what up

[Chorus: Saweetie]
'Cause I'm icy, wifey, haters wanna fight me
Never been the one get R.I.P. up on a white tee
Keep my hands clean, got some hittas moving sheisty
Ask me if I'm rollin' with some Gucci, bitch, I might be
It's very unlikely my wrist ain't lookin' icy
Chargin' by the minute 'cause my time is very pricey

[Verse 2: Saweetie]
Bougie when I'm broke, so I'm bougie when I'm poppin'
I've been workin', stack one up, check my price, then I tax
My education and my fashion gonna cost a couple racks
Nah, I don't need a sugar daddy, they call me when they need stacks
See, I went to USC and got my college degree
That means I'm smarter than these niggas, can't get over on me
And then I went out to Miami, saw some new property
Put a down payment on condo with a view of South Beach
Man, the devils try to break me, the devils try to play me
I coulda got here quicker if I let the devil slip me
But my prayers went up and my blessings came down
Thankin' God every day that your girl above ground (That's right)
And that's how a hot girl do it
Keep her head up, even when she goin' through it
My crown might slip, but it never ever falls
If my niggas ever need me, they know I am who to call

[Chorus: Saweetie]
'Cause I'm icy, wifey, haters wanna fight me
Never been the one get R.I.P. up on a white tee
Keep my hands clean, got some hittas moving sheisty
Ask me if I'm rollin' with some Gucci, bitch, I might be
It's very unlikely my wrist ain't lookin' icy
Chargin' by the minute 'cause my time is very pricey

[Outro: Saweetie]
Shout out to my girl, Kehlani, she killed that shit
From the Bay to Sacramento, North Cal, girl, we runnin' shit
Icy
