[Verse 1]
She had faded red paint on her windshield
Said, "Zero dollars down, come make a deal"
Passed by it every day 'til I couldn't pass it up no more
Rockin' three Goodyears and a Michelin
A tailgate hangin’ on by a thread
With an old V8 knock-knockin’ on heaven’s door

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows it wasn’t perfect
But every yard I cut to earn it was worth it

[Chorus]
Hell yeah, those were the good days
Driving by my own rules
Well, I crowned myself the king of the highway
Man, I never felt more cool, yeah, it's true, oh
They say ain’t nothin’ like the first time (Hell nah)
And it was love at first drive
Yeah, I owned that road in that rusty gold
Old truck I drove in high school

[Verse 2]
Always playin' chicken with the "Check Engine" light
Slipped a twenty dollar bill to the emission guy
Got her shined up good for that game every Friday night

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows it wasn’t perfect (Not even close)
But I was happy it was workin' (Workin')

[Chorus]
Hell yeah, those were the good days
Driving by my own rules
Well, I crowned myself the king of the highway
Man, I never felt more cool, yeah, it's true, oh
They say ain’t nothin’ like the first time (Hell nah)
And it was love at first drive
Yeah, I owned that road in that rusty gold
Old truck I drove in high school, yeah
(That truck I drove)

[Bridge]
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
I bet she runnin’ like nothin's changed
Duct tape, zip ties, static on the radio
Calvin on the back, pissin' on 24

[Chorus]
Hell yeah, those were the good days
Driving by my own rules (Oh, my own rules)
Well, I crowned myself the king of the highway (Ha, ha)
Man, I never felt more cool, yeah, it's true (I never felt more cool, yeah)
They say ain’t nothin’ like the first time (Hell nah)
And it was love at first drive
Yeah, I owned that road in that rusty gold
Old truck I drove in high school (Ah yeah)

[Outro]
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
I kinda wonder, I kinda wonder
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
(Yeah, that truck I drove, yeah, that truck I drove)
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
(Yeah, that truck I drove, yeah, that truck I drove)
I kinda wonder where she’s at these days
(Yeah, that truck I drove, yeah, that truck I drove)
I kinda wonder, I kinda wonder
(Yeah, that truck I drove, yeah, that truck I drove)
