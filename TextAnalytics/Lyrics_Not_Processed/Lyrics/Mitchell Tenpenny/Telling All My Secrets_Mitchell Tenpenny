[Verse 1]
She said, "Baby, tell me somethin'
You ain't never told no one before," oh yeah
Let's do some demolition
I'll just sit and listen while we break down this wall
I want the good, the bad, the hurt you had
I want your crazy
Unfold your soul
I wanna know everythin', baby

[Chorus]
Girl, you got me tellin' all my secrets
Promise me you'll keep 'em
And I'll let 'em loose
Baby, you must be my weakness
Usually, I'm speechless
Bulletproof, oh yeah
Well girl, you got me tellin' all my secrets
Tellin' all my secrets to you

[Post-Chorus]
La-da-da dap-pa, yeah
La-da-da dap-don, yeah
Yeah, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Baby, come a little closer
I'm gon' need to hold you
When I tell you this
Baby, kiss you with a whisper
Let me paint you a picture
With my fingertips
Oh girl, you got me changin' things
All my friends think that I'm crazy
But all of me has come to be
In love with you, baby

[Chorus]
Got me tellin' all my secrets
Promise me you'll keep 'em
And I'll let 'em loose
Baby, you must be my weakness
Usually, I'm speechless
Bulletproof, oh yeah
Well girl, you got me tellin' all my secrets
Tellin' all my secrets to you

[Post-Chorus]
La-yeah hey
Oh-whoa-oh

[Bridge]
Well, here's to the good, the bad
All I have
I love you like crazy
Well, all the messy, all the sexy
All of me, baby

[Chorus]
Tellin' all my secrets, oh
Promise me you'll keep 'em
And I'll let 'em loose
Oh, I'll let 'em loose
Baby, you must be my weakness
Usually, I'm speechless
And bulletproof, oh-oh
Well, girl, you got me tellin' all my secrets
Tellin' all my secrets to you

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, I'm tellin' 'em all
Oh, baby, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah
Ooh girl
Girl, you look so good
I will let them know, girl
Ooh, I'ma let 'em know, yeah
