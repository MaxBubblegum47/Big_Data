[Verse 1]
You say you miss me
'Cause he ain't like me
And I try to play it cool
Ask what you been up to
But I know what you've been up to
I been up to the same thing
Been tryin' to forget you
You been tryin' to forget me

[Chorus]
Why can't I fall in love with her like I fell for you
Why do I feel like I'm lyin' every time I tell the truth
Why do we restart every time we are
Tryin' to move on, girl, it's so hard
When you call me, your friend saw me
With somebody that ain't- and somebody ain't you
That somebody (Somebody)
Somebody ain't you
That somebody (Somebody)
Somebody ain't you

[Verse 2]
You the one that she knows about
Why I get it, go around
I guess it's just how it goes now
'Cause you're the one that we fight about

[Chorus]
Why can't I fall in love with her like I fell for you
Why do I feel like I'm lyin' every time I tell the truth
Why do we restart every time we are
Tryin' to move on, girl, it's so hard
When you call me, your friend saw me
With somebody that ain't- and somebody ain't you
Somebody ain't you

Why can't I fall in love with her like I fell for you
Why do I feel like I'm lyin' every time I tell the truth
Why do we restart every time we are
Tryin' to move on, girl, it's so hard
When you call me, your friend saw me
With somebody that ain't- and somebody ain't you

[Outro]
Yeah, uh-ohh
Somebody ain't you
Yeah
Somebody ain't you, oh
Ohh-oh-ohh
