Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Kid Cudi & Travis Scott]
Mm, nah, nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah, mm
Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah-nah, nah
Yeah, mm, nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah (Yeah)

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Couldn't tell me what the future holds (Uh-huh-huh)
With this cup, and it's me and bro, smokin' plenty (Plenty)
What you know about designers though? (Uh-huh-huh)
It gets up, you can feel the evil creepin' on ya
I was coolin' on the low and askin' one for back (Yeah)
Smoke a pack, ask some girlies doin' this and that (That)
And I know I could be low or gettin' somethin' right (Uh-huh)
Caught up in my demons, couldn't sink 'em but way in the back

[Verse: Travis Scott & Kid Cudi]
Out of my mind
I just booked and chose the moon, all night (Yeah)
Got it for the night (Mm)
If I tell you shoot, it go flip-flip-flip-flip
I can't see the future but I kiss the strip
I know it's good when I'm run this, I'ma die that man (It's lit)
I'm on the way up, I can't hesitate (Made her way)
She made her way up and then went right back down and did that shit (Yeah)
I'ma ride, but fuck it, when I slide
I'm never out to eat because she barely gives
Me nothin' or the sea, or stretchin'
With the fees for extras
Beat that, ayy, them blessings
Ayy, don't believe them blessings
Say after me, "We can't vouch for 'em
We can't vouch for 'em"
All of my dogs leave the house, you know it's the cop
We chill on the floor, on the floor, it's...
