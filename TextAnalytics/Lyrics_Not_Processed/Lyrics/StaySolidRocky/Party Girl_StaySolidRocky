[Intro]
Girls just wanna have fun
So they party, so they party
(
Ayy, yo, Nashi, you goin' crazy
)

[Chorus]
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you

[Verse]
She don't want nobody, she don't need somebody
I'm tryna be with you so you don't be without me
She totin' just like me, no, we can't leave without it
She boot up off the meds like she can't breathe without it
She drinkin' Four Lokos, I can't get with those
She wan' give me toto, I tell her come close
She say, "You say you love me, but I don't know what love means"
I ask her who got her heart, 'cause damn, that nigga lucky
I been tryna reach for it, but it's too far above me
I ain't never do you wrong, so tell me why you don't trust me
She don't do this often, she said it's only because me
You the one who want it, therefore you can never judge me
She just wanna party and nothing's wrong with that
Every time I'm calling, she say she gon' call me back
I told her call me Rocky, she say she not gon' call me that
You say you come with a lot, well, baby, I want all of that

[Chorus]
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you
She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you

[Outro]
Don't be scared to party, don't be scared to party
Don't be scared to party
