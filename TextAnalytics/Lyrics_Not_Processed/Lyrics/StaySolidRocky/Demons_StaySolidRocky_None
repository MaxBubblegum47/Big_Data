[Verse 1]
Lot of niggas say the in the streets, but I'm on top of it
I pray that I raise me a lil' beast just like my momma did
Either you get ate or you gon' eat, go state your dominance
I don't really think I thank myself for my accomplishments
Rollin' off a bean since 'bout like 3, it boost my confidence
I know that they probably lie to me, don't give me compliments
I heard that they speaking on my name, so now we stalking them
Walking with the devil to the grave, but I don't walk with them
Choppa pull up like a meet and greet, but I'm don't talk to them
Grab my feet and drag me underneath, but I can't fall for thеm
Looking in the mirror right on me and I see scars on him
He said that thеy demons coming back, don't get involved with them

[Chorus]
Demons in the dark, they in the dark, they in the dark, uh
Give 'em what they want, take what you want, just give it up, uh
How can I see them? I look around and I see blood, uh
I'ma keep my face, don't take my soul, I don't need love

[Verse 2]
I've been runnin' races, but I have no where to run, uh
I've been prayin' daily, talkin' to the man above, uh
Told him if they take me then I go out with my gun, uh
I know that they hating, I might go out just because, uh
I say they can't burn me, I hold thirty in this clip or two
I say "Bye bye birdie" then this clip will get to clippin' you

[?] these niggas, we can't clique with you
Demons coming back to haunt me, say I hope they get to you

[Chorus]
Demons in the dark, they in the dark, they in the dark, uh
Give 'em what they want, take what you want, just give it up, uh
How can I see them? I look around and I see blood, uh
I'ma keep my face, don't take my soul, I don't need love
Demons in the dark, they in the dark, they in the dark, uh
Give 'em what they want, take what you want, just give it up, uh
How can I see them? I look around and I see blood, uh
I'ma keep my face, don't take my soul, I don't need love

[Outro]
Demons in the dark
Demons in the dark
In the dark, oh
