[Intro: Trippie Redd]

Lil', uh, bitch
Ayy, yeah (Hahahaha, Nick, you're stupid)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
They don't understand who I am (Yeah, ayy, yeah)
I had to WWE slam (Slam)
Down on these fuck niggas, yeah, yeah (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I said they had the murder rate high, yeah (Bah)
I said they had the murder rate high, yeah (Had the murder rate high)
Pull up with them Glocks, nigga, like yeah (Yeah)
Pull up, send some shots, nigga, like yeah (Yeah)
Gunpowder get popped, nigga, like yeah (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
We done had the whole hood hot, nigga, yeah (Woo)
Pull out on the block, nigga, like yeah (Bitch)
I love the way your body drop, yeah, yeah (Way it drop, yeah)
The way it tumble then it flop, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
I don't got the time to be playin' games with the opps
Pull up with this chop and then I knock you out your socks (Bah)
Timeless, and I don't need a motherfuckin' clock
Man, I swear to God, all I need is my Glock and mop, yeah

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
They don't understand who I am (Yeah, ayy, yeah)
I had to WWE slam (Slam)
Down on these fuck niggas, yeah, yeah (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I said they had the murder rate high, yeah (Bah)
I said they had the murder rate high, yeah (Had the murder rate high)
Pull up with them Glocks, nigga, like yeah (Yeah)
Pull up, send some shots, nigga, like yeah (Yeah)
Gunpowder get popped, nigga, like yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 2: StaySolidRocky]
Bitch, we spin like Ricky Bobby, not the Bobby with lil' Whitney
I drop five up on the Glock and you think I ain't bring it with me
I put four-fives in this big three-oh and spark it like a blizzy
I don't show no love to city hoes, but I do love this Glizzy
Make her vow to me, you will never jam when you in need
With this laser beam put him underneath the concrete
Better not play with me, I'ma make sure you niggas sleep
Dig your grave for me, jump inside and tell me what you see, uh

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
They don't understand who I am (Yeah, ayy, yeah)
I had to WWE slam (Slam)
Down on these fuck niggas, yeah, yeah (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I said they had the murder rate high, yeah (Bah)
I said they had the murder rate high, yeah (Had the murder rate high)
Pull up with them Glocks, nigga, like yeah (Yeah)
Pull up, send some shots, nigga, like yeah (Yeah)
Gunpowder get popped, nigga, like yeah (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
We done had the whole hood hot, nigga, yeah (Woo)
Pull out on the block, nigga, like yeah (Bitch)
I love the way your body drop, yeah, yeah (Way it drop, yeah)
The way it tumble then it flop, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
