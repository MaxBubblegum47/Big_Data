Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro]
Woah
Bling-Blow

[Chorus]
Ah, Walkin' through tennis chains swanging I go to Venus (Uh)
Birthday cake don't care [?], I really don't distinguish (Uh)
Bubble coat, I'm totin' those, this Weston talking secret (Uh)
50 grams on top your head I drop it like a CD
'Cause it's nothing 2020 push start Mercedes left it runnin'
Waitin' for a bitch to leave holy like an Onion
Nigga really phony say he know me but he doesn't
Glizzy's for my day ones, berettas for my bousins

[Verse]
Nigga I ain't hoeing, catch me going that's for nothing
Fakin' boy you faking gotta face the repercussions
Nigga why you paranoid you fucking up my consious
We ain't tearing ACL's we giving out concussions
