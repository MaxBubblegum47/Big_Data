[Intro]
(
Play that, do that, let's do it
)
I hope you see me ballin'
I'm on my feet, when you leave me, I'm fallin'
My heart's so stone cold, Steve Austin
I'm finna ball with the green like I'm Boston
Did I switch up? Or maybe you lost me
We don't even speak, we go weeks without talking
But I'm still around if you need me, just call me
Do that make me dumb or do that make me solid?

[Chorus]
They flock when I walk in the room
And a Glock on me too (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Fire the beat, I spit fumes
Totaled the whip in the woods (Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom)
I'd bring the bag if I could but they already rollin the wood (Oh, oh)
I don't wanna love no more 'cause that shit make me do the most

[Verse 1]
Hold me tight, to you, I cry, girl, don't let me go
I put that wall back on my heart 'cause my feelings was exposed
You got me running races but my laces tied just like our souls
Matter fact, I'm tired too, I wish I laid beside you

[Bridge]
You say that we toxic but I think you still want it
You go find someone, I bet I bust, turn him to vomit
My heartbeat on zombie, I can feel it thumping
I hope that you come back 'cause you the one I'm loving

[Chorus]
They flock when I walk in the room
And a Glock on me too (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Fire the beat, I spit fumes
Totaled the whip in the woods (Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom)
I'd bring the bag if I could but they already rollin the wood (Oh, oh)
I don't wanna love no more 'cause that shit make me do the most

[Verse 2]
I saw something in you that you ain't even see in yourself
And what I thought you saw in me, you seem to see in somebody else
They say don't you run from love, I run the drugs, it seemed to help
We creep on the one you claim to love, like Taco Bell, we feed him shells
Sprayed, everybody get sprayed, everybody get sprayed, I ain't playin' no games
I'm finna give you my pain, I'm finna give you my pain, I ain't playin' no games
I really thought we were made but you wasn't thinking the same, I'm going insane
Look at the words that I sang, look at the words that I sang
You was my blessing from the heavens and I shoulda held you
I'd never do you wrong, you did the shit like somebody dared you
Put down your wall, let me see your heart, lil' mama, I care to
I should've been more careful, maybe I would've kept you

[Bridge]
You say that we toxic but I think you still want it
You go find someone, I bet I bust, turn him to vomit
My heartbeat on zombie, I can feel it thumping
I hope that you come back 'cause you the one I'm loving

[Refrain]
I hope you see me ballin'
I'm on my feet, when you leave me, I'm fallin'
My heart's so stone cold, Steve Austin
I'm finna ball with the green like I'm Boston
Did I switch up? Or maybe you lost me
We don't even speak, we go weeks without talking
But I'm still around if you need me, just call me
Do that make me dumb or do that make me solid?

[Outro]
They flock when I walk in the room
And a Glock on me too (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Fire the beat, I spit fumes
Totaled the whip in the woods (Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom)
I'd bring the bag if I could but they already rollin the wood (Oh, oh)
I don't wanna love no more 'cause that shit make me do the most
