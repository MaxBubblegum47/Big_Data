[Intro: StaySolidRocky]
(Oh, I'm ballin') I'm goin' up right now
(Oh, I'm ballin') Come and catch me (I'm ballin')

[Chorus: StaySolidRocky]
They told me, "Just play my position," then I'm takin' off
I'm playin' dumb, I'm really gifted, I'ma fake it all
I can't show no love, my mind conflictin' with my vacant heart
Take me to a place so far away, I'm havin' painless thoughts
You was the only who knew me 'til you broke up on
You got me ventin' to this bitch and I ain't got her fuckin' heart
I show my scars, they faked a hunnid but I see my flaws
I'm driftin' off, don't part your lips 'cause I don't wanna talk

[Verse 1: StaySolidRocky]
It's like 3 AM and it's just me until the mornin'
You in ATL, I'm callin' Steve, then he on it
Run my money up and pop a bean in a foreign
Crush her off a Perc', this bitch a fiend when she horny
I been here too long, I hit the road and then I drift off
She get in this whip, is you gon' fuck or you gon' get out?
I'ma coach my team, I call a blitz, your door get kicked down
Spinnin' like a fidget, like a midget, better get down
I'm landin' in puddles of blood, I feel I'm fallin'
You probably laughin', in love, just what you wanted
And I really got nowhere to run, I'm feelin' haunted
I can't go back to ways how I was, so take precaution (uh)
They say I'm accomplished, I feel like I lost it
Punchin' in the darkness and the water like a faucet
Niggas talk down often but I know that they don't want that
Got the nine on me like Tony and I'm shootin' and I'm scorin'

[Verse 2: Big4Kreezy]
Niggas ain't even with me, watch me rock out with this Smithy
Leave your partner shitty, hollows fuckin' up his kidneys
Rollin' off that whiskey, for that money we get risky
Steppers gon' get busy, want the smoke but he ain't wit' it
Sayin' that she with me, I don't know that bitch Intentions
Fragile as a bitch, my chopper dirt them pussy bitches
Glizzy in my britches, bitch, it's known for grantin' wishes
Boss all in my pockets, ain't no money for you bitches
Where are you? Who are you? (Yeah, yeah)
Perky pile slide and try to knock him out his shoes
I'on want no love, bitch, I need drugs, bitch, where the boofs?
Left me outchea badly, opposition's on me too
Freaky ho gon' fuck me, money longer than a broom
I like rockstar drugs, beat that pussy off of shrooms
Lottie's in the Wraith, we smokin' opps out on the moon
And catch his ass in winter, we gon' stretch his ass in June

[Chorus: StaySolidRocky]
They told me, "Just play my position," then I'm takin' off
I'm playin' dumb, I'm really gifted, I'ma fake it all
I can't show no love, my mind conflictin' with my vacant heart
Take me to a place so far away, I'm havin' painless thoughts
You was the only who knew me 'til you broke up on
You got me ventin' to this bitch and I ain't got her fuckin' heart
I show my scars, they faked a hunnid but I see the flaws
I'm driftin' off, don't part your lips 'cause I don't wanna talk

[Outro: StaySolidRocky]
Don't wanna talk (Oh), don't wanna talk (Oh)
Don't wanna talk (Oh)
Uh, you said, "Fine," you said, "Fine," now I'm fine
