[Verse]
Who could be really with me, when I’m rolling in the weather?
If you really with me then we 'post to be together
You made me a solider now my heart is made of metal
Disguised as an angel I was falling for the devil
Now all of my pain turning into soft aggression
Coming for your brains no remains on the stretcher
I got beams on top of beams and my dreams it's a blessing
I got money from the fiends to be playing like the rest them
Left some people in my past I had to cut 'em for the better
I don't really feel like fuck 'em but just fuck it it's whatever
I'mma take you from your family if you take me from my cheddar
If I'm lacking then don't spare me cause I should've been more careful
I'm busting off the pack I'm leaning back I drift I drive
In a room full of people I feel lonely deep inside
Shawty tell me that you love me I won't judge you fuck your pride
I want you now you move around
You come back home and we be fine
If he think he fuck with me then he must be out of his mind
My nigga pop out at your house like it's a party prove some pride
Double SD on my tombstone I stay solid in the prize
I be busting controlled substance when I'm rolling in the ride
Look to the sky and ask 'em why lately my feelings been gone
They already broke my heart I feel they breaking me off
I got a list I make a call I'm Malcolm X'ing 'em off
You got a problem my solution get my weapon involved
I be stepping no direction if I crash then I'm gone
I'm smoking all your family tree I guess I'm ashing your bro
How the fuck I'm giving you my all and you still asking for more?
I make a path for all my dogs and then I'm passing it on
I don't know if I'm down to make that call cause you been fucking me off
It hit they ass ain't seen it coming Nina sing like Ray Charles
Throw on a mask and bust your pumpkin Halloween not involved
We do got hollows if you want 'em get delivered tomorrow
I apologize for my demeanor I can't help I'm a leaner
I ain't only rapping for myself cause I'mma speak for my people
Hands held together pray to God cause I can't visit the reaper
That's why I'm tryna sin the other side as soon as I see 'em
I be yelling tell Aretha, mom, I'm so traumatized
They telling me that love is blind but I got blood in my eyes
I feel like Jesus in the sky cause they cross me like A.I
All this pain up in my body make it hard to survive
