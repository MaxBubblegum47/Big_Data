[Verse 1]
I never changed, man, fuck the fame, bitch, I don't want it now
Won't stress a bitch, they come a dime by a dozen, ah

I'm lost at sea, look at your eyes, I see they flooded, uh
You carry me, I shit on you, this what you wanted, uh
I still got me somethin' to prove, I want the money, uh
I'm tryna get rid of all my blues with blue face hundreds, uh
I fell in love and I knew I shouldn't of done it, uh
You broke my heart and I ain't even knew I seen it comin', uh
I cut 'em off, I'm not involved, I leave 'em bloody, uh
They fold on me, I kill 'em all and that's for nothin', uh
I swear to God I'm goin' hard, bitch, I'ma buss it, yeah
This choppa walk up on his block and leave him runnin', yeah
This hollow hit 'em while they hot up out the oven, yeah
