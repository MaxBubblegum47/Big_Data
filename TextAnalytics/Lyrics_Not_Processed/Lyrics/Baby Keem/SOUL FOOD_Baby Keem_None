[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning
Brush my teeth before I see my queen, yeah
Wow, who are you?
Bitch I'm two phone Baby Keem
She think I'm selfish
I like soul food
Pussy taste like soul food
That's why you've been my go to
And that's my whole thang
She go both ways
In my whole face
I do [?]
I come through real quick
The head good, I switch lanes
I keep a bad one
She got a resting bitch face

[Verse]
Don't talk to me when I stomp in this bitch, ho ho
Address me properly when I stomp in this bitch, lil bro
I keep the mop for a loser
Lil misfits, she gave me top on the cruiser
Aye, aye, yeah, gang with me
I keep gang with me
I'ma keep your ass on ten
If I leave you follow me, huh
I hit my white bitch with the chopstick
She just hit the spliff
She all on me, we can't lock lips, ew

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning
Brush my teeth before I see my queen, yeah
Wow, who are you?
Bitch I'm two phone Baby Keem
She think I'm selfish
I like soul food
Pussy taste like soul food
That's why you've been my go to
And that's my whole thang
She go both ways
In my whole face
I do [?]
I come through real quick
The head good, I switch lanes
I keep a bad one
She got a resting bitch face
