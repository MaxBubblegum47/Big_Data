[Chorus]
This won't be the first time that I confess
And I think it's time to face it that I hate my ex
If you wanna get complacent, think I'll hate you next
And I wanna see you naked, but I hate safe sex, yeah
Show some emotion, make it multiply
You don't like to focus, 'cause I'm in and out your life
Show some emotion and I'll make it multiply
You don't like to focus, 'cause I'm in and out your life (Ayy)

[Verse]
Smokin' big protein and it's potent
Chose up, now I'm on to the next, ayy
Had a feelin', now I'm on to the next, ayy
And I put you in my songs 'cause I'm stressed
Either way, it's still fun, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma laugh at your wrongs, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Drugs in my system, drugs in my system)
Put your ass in my arms, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Drugs in my system, drugs in my system)
You want it fast, want it long, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Show some emotion and I'll make it multiply)
Mix the D'usse, I'm the one, give two fucks 'bout what you say
(You don't like to focus, 'cause I'm in and out your life)
When I see you, it's like starin' at a new face
My life changed when I seen you with your new bae
It's not the fact you moved on, it's the principle
Why you talk to bums? Treat the Louis like a visitor
You say this nigga average and that's just what you like
You hate when I ignore you, I have to board my flight

[Chorus]
This won't be the first time that I confess
And I think it's time to face it that I hate my ex
If you wanna get complacent, think I'll hate you next
And I wanna see you naked, but I hate safe sex, yeah
Show some emotion, make it multiply
You don't like to focus, 'cause I'm in and out your life
Show some emotion and I'll make it multiply
You don't like to focus, 'cause I'm in and out your life (Ayy)
This won't be the first time that I confess
And I think it's time to face it that I hate my ex
If you wanna get complacent, think I'll hate you next
And I wanna see you naked, but I hate safe sex, yeah
Show some emotion, make it multiply
You don't like to focus, 'cause I'm in and out your life
Show some emotion and I'll make it multiply
You don't like to focus, 'cause I'm in and out your life
