[Chorus: Jay Rock]
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
112th Street, Deuce Line, tell a friend
Parkin' lots, dope spots, hard rock, I'ma get
Duke it out and shoot it out, fuck a opp, who was him?
Pack him out, I stall him out, we need to find out where he live
GTA's, 211s, double dutchin', Mack-11s
Section 8, welfare, EBTs on the dresser
Crash dummies, real killers, fast money kill niggas
Blast for me, real nigga, ask for me, deal with you
Pay your fare, play it fair, here's a scale, weight it here
Kick a door, head choke, take it all, hit the stairs
Yellow bricks, peddle bricks, get a ounce, get a zip
Shotty bounce, hit his hip, make that body do a flip
I'm a vet, I'ma rep, I'm a boss, I'ma flex
I'ma turn up for the set, take this bottle to the neck
Pre-rolls for the hoes, more licks for the homies
Five hundred for the K, share it with the members only

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I got all the baddest bitches in rotation
I'll be smashin', I can't even date 'em
Boy get you some money, you be hatin'
Got the chopper on me waitin' for you to say some
Got that gas in rotation and it's good cook (good cook)
Tryna live right, gotta stay by that good book
I got the foreigns in rotation, twelve they be hatin'
Hit a corner, Bentley truck I'm skatin' (Bentley what?)
Ooh, I let her face it
Ooh, your bitch basic and we made it
Rappers outdated
Oh you hatin', I'm on a jet to Vegas
CEO like I'm Top, Richard Mille I cop
I keep goin' platinum, I'ma buy another drop
Who the plug callin'? Plug stallin'
30 bricks, I'm out in New Orleans

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation

[Bridge: Jay Rock]
Pull up, pop shit, hop out, drop shit, chopstick's on me
Pull up, pop shit, hop out, drop shit, chopstick's on me

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
To all the real niggas, let's pledge allegiance right now
Okay, I slide by myself, I don't need no help (that's right)
Chopper on the seat, no safety belt (say what?)
I slide by myself, I don't need no help (that's right)
Chopper on the seat, no safety belt (okay now)
Get off if you mad, get off if you mad
Get off if you mad, get off if you mad
I'ma get off if I'm mad, get off if I'm mad
Get off if I'm mad, I'ma get off if I'm mad

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
