[Hook]
Rolling top down
We don't talk now
Where my clique at?
Where my bitch at?
Ten bands to my mans then we flip that, aye
Ten models tapping in on the dispatch, aye
What the get up today, aye
You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my way, aye
You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my way, aye
You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my way

[Verse]
And my momma told me always keep a strap (keep a strap)
You could shoot a pussy nigga if they go behind your back (woah, woah, woah, woah)
Run it up and run it up again, (aye) aye
Always on the move, never catch the same friends, aye
Get back, get back, I count the racks now
New hoe, new hoe, know how to act now (act)
I just, switch lanes, team on my back now
I just, tried to, give your hoe back but, uh
Get up with me bitch (get, uh)
Get up with me, i'm a dog in my city bitch
Now i'm getting richer
If a nigga want this smoke, put him on a picture, aye
I just cuff his bitch and knocked her twin sister, aye
Touchdown in your country on a world tour (world tour)
My ex ain't know shit but acting so sure
She ain't want me then, but she want me now
These hoes wanna hear me for my money now

You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my way, aye
You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my way

[Outro]
You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my way, aye
You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my way
You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my way, aye
