[Chorus]
Aye, ride for me
You gon' die for me
You gon' be the one to throw that to the side for me
You gon' get a little thicky in the thighs on me
Will you ride for me?
Ride or die for me?

[Verse]
Don't believe this bitches, cause they lie on me
Baby don't you entertain these other guys around me, aye
Ride for me
Baby, ride for me, aye
Ride for me
Ride or die for me
Heart is on stand by
Niggas ain't sayin' none
I can [?]
Bitches always sayin' some
I can catch a damn vibe
[?] on stand by
What the fuck you sayin' hoe?
I can chill and you can sit back and count these bands though
Park the whip, start askin' for these keys to the Lambo
I don't understand why you keep actin' like a fan though
Heard you feel a certain way
On my way

[Chorus]
Aye, ride for me
You gon' die for me
You gon' be the one to throw that to the side for me
You gon' get a little thicky in the thighs on me
Will you ride for me?
Ride or die for me?
Don't believe this bitches, cause they lie on me
Baby don't you entertain these other guys around me, aye
Ride for me
Baby, ride for me, aye
Ride for me
Ride or die for me
