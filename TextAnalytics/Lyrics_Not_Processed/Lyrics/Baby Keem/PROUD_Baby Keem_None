[Intro: Baby Keem]
Aye
Yeah, pull up
Air out
Where is the function?
I be in her back
Beat the walls, Tim Duncan
Soul Food
This ain't it, no assumption
Kung fu, on your whole crew

[Verse 1: Baby Keem]
Got the monsters
I just seen a Louis bag
I made my woman merch it
I gave you two chances, I might reverse it
Baby we grown, we not meant to be perfect
Shut the fuck up

[Chorus: Baby Keem & Bakar]
Baby then I make her proud
Then I make her proud, yeah
Then I make her proud
Then I make her proud
Baby then I make her proud
Then I make her proud, yeah
Then I make her proud
Then I make her proud, yeah
I guess we got together at the wrong time
We was sposed to be together for a long time
Why does it happen like that
Sometimes it happens like that

[Verse 2: Baby Keem]
I love when we cuddle, yeah
We annoy each other. yeah
But don’t be annoyin', yeah
That too much turmoil, yeah
Either way I love it
Don't destroy each other
Touchin’ one another
Tell me where your going
Pocket on ten, holding big proteins
Serve the ops, hit licks, Baby Keem, you're mean
Am I your type?
I'm black with a big magazine
Fuck a thot, I need you with me

[Chorus: Baby Keem & Bakar]
Baby then I make her proud
Then I make her proud, yeah
Then I make her proud
Then I make her proud
Baby then I make her proud
Then I make her proud, yeah
Then I make her proud
Then I make her proud, yeah
I guess we got together at the wrong time
We was sposed to be together for a long time
Why does it happen like that
Sometimes it happens like that
I guess we got together at the wrong time
We was sposed to be together for a long time
Why does it happen like that
Sometimes it happens like that

[Verse 3: Bakar & Baby Keem]
Life line, write mine
Think I lost my right mind
Zeitgeist, fi fi
Found me at the right time
I think she found me at the right time
I think she- 
Yeah, smokin' on this
