[Chorus]
Aye, I am your big homie
Aye, show me respect
Bitch show me the text
Two phones on my chest
I flex on my ex
I don't send her texts
I beat up the box

[Verse]
Can you razzle dazzle me?
I need someone thats gon' come back and challenge me
I go crazy if a nigga go dumb for you
I go crazy we don't need another casualty
I be flippin' it, poppin' shit when I be shoppin' shit
Too many hoes and they gettin' provocative
Your bitch a hater, a nigga too confident
Your boy a eater and I am the opposite

[?]
You hoes make me sick
Too many o's I'm lit, aye
Broke hoe make me mad
I can't stand my ex
I can't fuck that bitch
Her best friend watching me

[?] me with a big one
Now she running giving feedback
No

[Chorus]
Aye, I am your big homie
Aye, show me respect
Bitch show me the text
Two phones on my chest
I flex on my ex
I don't send her texts
I beat up the box
