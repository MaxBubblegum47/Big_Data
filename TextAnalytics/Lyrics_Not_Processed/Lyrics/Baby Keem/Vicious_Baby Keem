[Verse 1: Baby Keem]
Who is that, that nigga that keep playin' with them bands?
You know when your nigga get some shit he never had?
Cashin' out the Rari, max it out to make you mad (woah)
All my hoes tap out, they so fufu, thought it was facts

[Hook: Baby Keem]
I keep guns in the vault
I can't fuck in the dark
Either you real or you not
Spaceship, push to start
Crib right by the coast
Gave my hit a stain
Jumbo bitch on me
Said she like my name
I keep guns in the vault
I can't fuck in the dark
Either you real or you not
Spaceship, push to start
Crib right by the coast
Gave my hit a stain
Jumbo bitch on me
Said she like my name
And I--

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious

[Verse 2: Baby Keem]
Gettin' richer, yeah, yeah, yeah
She wanna take a picture, yeah, yeah
I got one hand on the trigger, yeah, yeah
Got my other on the liquor, yeah, yeah
And I'm jumping out the Fisker, woah, woah
I fuck her but want her sister, woah, woah
That's a one-way flight from Pittsburgh, woah, woah
That's your Rolex? Mine is bigger, woah, woah

[Hook: Baby Keem]
I keep guns in the vault
I can't fuck in the dark
Either you real or you not
Spaceship, push to start
Crib right by the coast
Gave my hit a stain
Jumbo bitch on me
Said she like my name
I keep guns in the vault
I can't fuck in the dark
Either you real or you not
Spaceship, push to start
Crib right by the coast
Gave my hit a stain
Jumbo bitch on me
Said she like my name
And I--

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious
Pourin' out my liquor, swear it's vi-vi-vi-vi-vicious

[Hook: Baby Keem]
I keep guns in the vault
I can't fuck in the dark
Either you real or you not
Spaceship, push to start
Crib right by the coast
Gave my hit a stain
Jumbo bitch on me
Said she like my name
And I--
