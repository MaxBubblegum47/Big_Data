Love Hurts
You know
Love Hurts
Chopper'
Hold that Chopper'
Swallow fosters
She's a saucer
Downgraded
She the limit
You won't toss her

(Yea)

Mama imma' make a fortune
Imma get you there
I can feel the pressure
I got white hairs
I can feel the stares
If I hit rock bottom
Will you meet me there
(ay)

(mm)
Told me not to drop the top
So I dropped the roof
Told my bitches
Never lie
So they tell the truth

You gon
Change on me
Strange on me
Switch lanes on me

I like my bitches nice
Cause i like what i like and that's the truth
You got my heart on ice
Thinkin' bout the times
With you

Love Hurts
You know
Love Hurts
Chopper'
Hold that Chopper'
Swallow fosters
Finna sauce her
Downgraded
She the limit
You won't toss her
