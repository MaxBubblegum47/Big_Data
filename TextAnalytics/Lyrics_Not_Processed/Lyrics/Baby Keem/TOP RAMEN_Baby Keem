[Verse 1]
I'm sick of the rah-rah-rah
I'm not finna slide if your block hot
Big rock band, he's a shooter
Heard him talkin' about the hacks, no computer (Yeah)
Eat a drumstick (Yeah)
Top dawg, but my bitch still eat Top Ramen (Yeah)
Met my mom
My mom said she a top woman (Yeah)
I got fame and she help me keep my conscious (Yeah)
I don't sneak around, if I do, I have fun (Huh)
If they cancel me, then I retire, get the drum (Yeah)
If they cancel me, then I might have to pop the trunk (Yeah)
If they cancel me, I black on black my Air Force Ones (Yeah, let's go)

[Chorus]
Tired of rah-rah-rah
Serve a look, bitch face like raw, raw, raw
Say he quit the double cup, that's raw, raw, raw
Hit your ho, I'm finna nut, say bye, bye, bye

[Verse 2]
Leave a nigga stranded
I'm a fuck nigga (Yeah, yeah)
I'm a fuckin' bandit (Yeah)
On my momma Janice (Okay)
Eatin' Church's Chicken (Chicken)
All I eat is chicken (Yeah)
Beat the box like (Let's go)
Beat the box like (Let's go)
Whole Foods on my neck, fuckin' up
Pink clothes to my neck, fuckin' up
My bitch messy, my neck fuckin' up
I get bands, you pay respect, fuckin' up
Check, check, check, check, check please
Check one, two, get your bitch off me
Your bitch on TV if my sex tape leak
Your bitch on DVD, she won an ESPY

[Chorus]
Tired of raw, raw, raw
Serve a look, bitch phrase like raw, raw, raw
Say he quit the double cut, that's raw, raw, raw
Hit your ho, I'm finna nut, say bye, bye, bye
