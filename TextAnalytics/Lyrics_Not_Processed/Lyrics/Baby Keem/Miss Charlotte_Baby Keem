[Chorus]
Okay, cool, great, uh
My mama told me that you ain't right for me, pop up
I wanna pull up to your crib, I'ma pop up
Sixty bands on your head, I'ma pop up (Yeah)
Ayy, pull up on me, ten shows, ten hoes, bitch, I'm flowin'
Stroll through the mall, spend it all 'cause I'm ballin'
Drop six on my wrist, lil' mama, Miss Charlotte
Face on, fakin' on

[Post-Chorus]
Pick you up, lay you in the bed
Keep you wetter, fuckin' love your head
Work you out, I'm around, bitch, I love your head
Keep you 'round, hold you down, fuckin' love your head, woah
Pick you up, lay you in the bed
Keep you wetter, fuckin' love your head
Work you out, I'm around, bitch, I love your head
Keep you 'round, hold you down, fuckin' love your head, woah

[Verse]
I could take offence, but you been changed on me
My ex took a wrist 'cause she been changed on me
Smokin' doobies with your friends, why did you change on me?
I tried to talk some sense, but you still changed on me
Ayy, I know what you like, your best friend like woah (Yeah)
Pussy fuckin' up my life, in my head like woah (Yeah)
Boss up on the price, take a risk like woah
Lil' mama been a freak and I already know
Ayy, condom in my pocket, your girl ho, please stop it
Fuck up these price tags, love it, I'ma buy it
Stop sellin' dope, your sister love me
Only got the top, you actin' like we fuckin'
Scoop you in the whip, pick you up, I say so
Ayy, bitch, you ain't even got no say so
Ayy, I drive whip, I'm poppin' with my woes
I'ma surprise you, keep your eyes closed, I'ma, ayy

[Chorus]
Okay, cool, great, uh
My mama told me that you ain't right for me, pop up
I wanna pull up to your crib, I'ma pop up
Sixty bands on your head, I'ma pop up
Ayy, pull up on me, ten shows, ten hoes, bitch, I'm flowin'
Stroll through the mall, spend it all 'cause I'm ballin'
Drop six on my wrist, lil' mama, Miss Charlotte
Face on, fakin' on

[Post-Chorus]
Pick you up, lay you in the bed
Keep you wetter, fuckin' love your head
Work you out, I'm around, bitch, I love your head
Keep you 'round, hold you down, fuckin' love your head, woah
Pick you up, lay you in the bed
Keep you wetter, fuckin' love your head
Work you out, I'm around, bitch, I love your head
Keep you 'round, hold you down, fuckin' love your head, woah
