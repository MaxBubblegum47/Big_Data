[Intro]
Bad habit

[Chorus]
Check, please (Yeah)
Think I spent too much on a neckpiece
No backseat
Gas up the foreign, it got acne
I run the city, I'm the next guy
She let me fuck with my eyes closed
Keep a bad bitch with my eyes closed
She a bad bitch with a white nose

[Verse]
Lil' mama wanna pay for the dick
That nigga lame 'cause he pay for his clique (Check, please)
Bitch mad, wanna cry 'cause I hit
Tellin' on your mans, this shit ain't it (Check, please)
Ayy, yeah, put her out there
Now your man's gon' put choppers on his headstone
Check the info, I'm poppin' presidential
Fuck a TED Talk, I'm finna let my bands talk (Check, please)
Ayy, this ain't MTV, lil' bitch
She just wanna fuck, Google me and see I'm rich
Let her keep the check, it get drippy cause I'm next (Check, please)
Gang, gang, gang, it get drippy where I live
First of all, I'm sellin' out the motherfuckin' crib, ayy
Jackie Chan if he really want the dips, ayy
'Nother customer, I wanna cram, lil' baby
He keep comin' back, he say the xan go crazy (Check, please)

[Chorus]
Check, please (Yeah)
Think I spent too much on a neckpiece
No backseat
Gas up the foreign, it got acne
I run the city, I'm the next guy
She let me fuck with my eyes closed
Keep a bad bitch with my eyes closed
She a bad bitch with a white nose
