[Chorus]
I just robbed that nigga for his pack, then I flex on him
I just made my lil' whip fast ’cause I flex on 'em (Skrt)
Now I'm somewhere in the Hidden Hills ’cause I'm flexin' (Yeah)
Saint Laurent draws on my ass, spent a check on 'em (Yeah)
She gon' let me hit it from the back, now I'm flexin' (Yeah, yeah)
Double park the whip in the back, bitch, I'm flexin’ (Yeah, yeah)
I got lists of hoes I wanna fuck, on my checklist (Yeah, yeah)
Let me see that ass on the headboard when you dancin’ (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse]
You can read my text messages (Yeah)
Bitch, I do you way better than your ex-man (Woah)
You a lil' nasty, I like when you talkin’ reckless (Woah)
Go and live a little, then come home and get affection, yeah, yeah, yeah
She come over, yeah, she all in my phone, yeah
She my centerfold, bad bitch, no cuddlebug, uh
When she need it, let her cuddle with me (Yeah, yeah)
If a ho out of line, she gon run up for me, ayy (Yeah)
Back it up, lil' bitch, you gon' have to earn your ransom
Night night to her man, she say fuck him like he cancer (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I just robbed that nigga for his pack, then I flex on him
I just made my lil' whip fast ’cause I flex on 'em (Yeah, yeah)
Now I'm somewhere in the Hidden Hills 'cause I'm flexin' (Yeah, yeah)
Saint Laurent draws on my ass, spent a check on 'em (Yeah, yeah)
She gon' let me hit it from the back, now I'm flexin'
Double park the whip in the back, bitch, I'm flexin'
I got lists of hoes I wanna fuck, on my checklist
Let me see that ass on ahead, woah, when you dancin'
