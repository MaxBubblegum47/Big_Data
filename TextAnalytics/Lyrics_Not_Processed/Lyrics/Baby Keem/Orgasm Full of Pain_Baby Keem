[Intro: Baby Keem & Guapdad 4000]
Yeah

That's the key, that's the smooth right there, yeah (Yeah)
I been drinkin' this liquor, bitch, this ain't no liquor
But it made my shit bigger, yeah, it made my shit, it made my shit
I'm drinkin' this liquor, bitch, this ain't no liquor
But it made my shit bigger (Yeah) it made my shit, it made my shit

[Chorus: Guapdad 4000 & Baby Keem]
Orgasm full of pain
I been drinkin' this liquor, bitch, this ain't no liquor (Yeah)
But it made my shit bigger, yeah (Ay)
It made my shit, it made my shit
Hangover for champagne
I been drinkin' this liquor, bitch, this ain't no liquor
But it made my shit bigger, yeah
It made my shit, it made my shit
Orgasm full of pain
I been drinkin' this liquor, bitch, this ain't no liquor
But it made my shit bigger, yeah (Uh)
It made my shit, it made my shit
Can't feel the same, I just can't
I been drinkin' this liquor, bitch, (Yeah) this ain't no liquor (Yeah)
But it made my shit bigger, yeah
It made my shit, it made my shit
Orgasm full of-

[Verse 1: Guapdad 4000]
I hide my pride, but still came to say
She had the time of her lil' stupid ass life
Crawlin' in that candy paint (Yeah)
Strawberry with the flakes
Sour apple green, Dapper Dan Gucci seams bendin' to the bank (Gucc')
Touch more road than the street sweeper
For fishes in the tank, not to see, (Nice) but to eat
Sashimi tuna on my plate, (Plate) for the liquor in my face (Yeah)
Like chefs with fillet, she wanna put a truffle on my meat
I'm cuttin' up today (Look)
What is life for an Oakland dude? Ghetto got my soul confused
I used my white voice 'til my patience (Yeah) was overused
Use my black force and the white say the local rules
Sink water, leftover food (Uh)
Was tap inside my cups, but it's not from the local brews
Uncles and daddies and all my cousins all been on the local news
Gentrification came to rape us and then the locals moved
And it's all love, as we all bust

[Chorus: Guapdad 4000, Baby Keem & Deante Hitchcock]
Orgasm full of pain, yeah (Shit, huh)
Ay, hangover for champagne (Yeah, this shit slap, nigga)
(I'm finna beat somebody today)
Orgasm full of pain
I been drinkin' this liquor, (Yeah) bitch, this ain't no liquor
But it made my shit bigger, yeah (Uh)
It made my shit, it made my shit
Can't feel the same, I just can't
I been drinkin' this liquor, (Yeah) bitch, this ain't no liquor (Yeah)
But it made my shit bigger, yeah (Ay)
It made my shit, it made my shit
Hangover for champagne
I been drinkin' this liquor, bitch, this ain't no liquor
But it made my shit bigger, yeah (Ay)
It made my shit, it made my shit (Okay)
Orgasm full of pain (Yeah)
I been drinkin' this liquor, (Shit) bitch, this ain't no liquor (What was the question?)
But it made my shit bigger, yeah
It made my shit, (Okay) it made my shit
Can't feel the same, I just can't

[Verse 2: Deante Hitchcock & Guapdad 4000]
I fuck the bitch these niggas pay to fuck
But I never gave a fuck 'bout all of the things that most people go crazy for
I been savin' up bread from projects to get my folks out the projects
But I'm projected, hol' up, what was the question?
I tweak, must be the weed, know I reek
Don't tell my momma, I promised her I would quit by a week or so ago (Yeah)
And I know she know I be lyin'
But I think she feelin' drained and don't wanna force it on me
Let that sink in for a second
This ink pen is my weapon
I tweak again, what's the question?
This edible really over here whoopin' my ass, dawg
Okay, I'm feelin' it
Killin' shit how I'm makin' a livin'
Me and my syndicate livin' more frivolous
Now that all my business legitimate
Grew up a citizen in a city where folks slime outsellers
Slytherin all for the love of the Benjamins (Yeah)
Pendulum swing, rap, shame song, camouflage blendin' in
'Cause those who stand out, soon require casket to sit 'em in, shit
What was the question again, bruh?
I'm off a Xanny, please don't tell my granny, don't think she be understanding
I took a trip to LA for the Grammy's
Pockets on scampi, that shrimp, just like this plane, I can't tip
I want my pockets on crip, so I'ma hustle like Nip
For them blue faces, shoelaces tied, they want me to slip
But I can't fall at all, (Yeah) me and my dawgs gon' ball
Something, fall, somethin', something, at all
Orgasm full of pain
