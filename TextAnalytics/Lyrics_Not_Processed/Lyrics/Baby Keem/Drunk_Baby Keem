{Intro}
Hey, yeah
You lucky I ain't sayin nothin' to ya

Cause you only come around when you drunk or you high
You only come around when you drunk or you high
Hey

{Chorus}
Seen the light, what your friend said
What your friend said
Oh you so classy now
Yeah you fancy now
But you only come around
When you drunk or you high
I need you to roll the dice
Roll the dice, Roll the dice, Roll the-
I want her to roll the dice
Roll the dice, Roll the dice, Roll the-
I want her to roll the dice
Roll the dice, Roll the dice, Roll the-
I want her to roll the dice

{Verse}
My new bitch top 5
I said my new bitch top 5
If a nigga touch my hoe then he might have to die
I'ma buss it down when I touch it
But she wanna roll
And my pockets swole
I might make {?}
{?}
{?} when you open up the drawer
Living fancy
I got snipers in the city
Don't you chance it
All my presidents are dead
I took some chances
{?}
Sent a couple bands to my moms
She don't ask me twice
Now they wanna pull up on a man
Cause I

{Chorus}
Seen the light, what your friend said
What your friend said
Oh you so classy now
Yeah you fancy now
But you only come around
When you drunk or you high
I need you to roll the dice
Roll the dice, Roll the dice, Roll the-
I want her to roll the dice
Roll the dice, Roll the dice, Roll the-
I want her to roll the dice
Roll the dice, Roll the dice, Roll the-
I want her to roll the dice
