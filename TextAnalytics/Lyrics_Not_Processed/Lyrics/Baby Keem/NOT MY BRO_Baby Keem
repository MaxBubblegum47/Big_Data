[Verse 1]
Hoes in the whip, 
ten toes on the ship
She wastin' time on a nigga that ain't shit (Uh)
Hit it from the back (Uh), I never left (Uh)
Ice cream boogers on my wrist, that's a fact
 (Ayy)
Fuck him up, he was checking my bitch (Huh)
I was havin' fun 'til my checking took a hit (Ayy)
Two-phone Baby Keem, I might take a nigga shit (Ayy)
Bitch, I'm on the run, I smash the gas then I split
You niggas not my bro, you niggas not my homeboy
You niggas rock the boat, you niggas love to cap
I might take a loss, then I make it back
If I take a loss, I'ma make it back (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Shots at your kickback, (Uh), bitch, get back
I said, bro, get back, (Uh, yeah), you don't want no smoke
You don't want no crack, (Ayy), get back (Huh)
Get back, I said, bro, get back

[Verse 2]
Yeah, fuck did you think?
Pump fake, you talkin' to me?
I'm with the fleet and we roll deep
We aren't the same, my squad is unique (Ayy)
Don't trust a sorry ho, my momma told me that
Ice cream, wrist pistachio, big water, hold the tap (Yeah)
Huh, focus straight to the whip, I floor it
Bust out a fit, I wore it
Textin' your bitch, ignore it
Dick print, hope I'm her MCM, she dig the source
Cartier frames, this is my bitch, I see that the vibes distorted
Hop in the four-door, I am the sensei
Hop in the Range, I am the sensei
Big protein, take it to my brain, I am the sensei
How much you make? You watchin' my pockets
We not the same,  I am the sensei
Kick that bitch if she switch up on the gang (Whoa)

[Chorus]
Shots at your kickback, (Uh), bitch, get back
I said, bro, get back, (Uh, yeah), you don't want no smoke
You don't want no crack, (Ayy), get back (Huh)
Get back, I said, bro, get back
