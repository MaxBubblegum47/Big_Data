[Chorus]
When he cheat on you, then I got the refund
See, you keep all of your receipts for a reason
Let me come over, I'ma slice you, slice you
Let me come over, I’ma slice you, slice you

[Verse]
Yeah, I'ma show you off, make these bitches dislike you
I'm losin’ service on the FaceTime, I'll write you
I like keepin' all my feelings on the light end
I don't mind kissin' on your forehead when you frightened
Baby need some renovations
Stay by my side, you got too much patience
I'ma make the change, clap your hands for me
Change my lil' baby life, damn, we really made it

[Chorus]
When he cheat on you, then I got the refund
See, you keep all of your receipts for a reason
Let me come over, I'ma slice you, slice you
Let me come over, I’ma slice you, slice you
