[Intro: Jay Rock]
Dear God, I wanna thank you for this big redemption
Dear God‚ I wanna thank you for this bad bitch I got on my side
Dear God‚ I wanna thank you for letting me be a real nigga
Dear God‚ I wanna thank you for giving me a second chance
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Dear God, I wanna thank you for all these dollars and gold

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
Top off‚ drop off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me‚ bitch, knock it off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch, knock it off (Where the cash at?)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
East Side Johnny on one, ain't no question what it is
.223, I'll let you hold one if you come between my ends
Hunters slidin' through the streets, hunters slidin' through the pen
Politickin' on the yard, drop your ass off a tier
I don't trust nobody but my daughter and my shotty
If it blasts, that's a bag, if he live, for the body
Two door seats, you know me, windows tinted so the law don't see
I like top when she all on me, panties drop when they call on me
Skin-tight fade with the red Cortez
Clip ain't in but it's one in the head
Girl don't play with it, heard what I said?
Girl don't play with it, heard what I said?
Ain't no stains upon my suede, I been high for like four days
On the vibe for like four days, catchin' fades and runnin' plays, goddamn

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch, knock it off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch, knock it off (Where the cash at?)

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
I'm on ten, I go in, I just pop, I just win
Off the lot, in the wind, I am Rock, who is him?
Fuck you doin'? Get a bag, sellin' work in the lab
Smokin' purp in the Lam', pull up, skrrt, 'Rari fast
Off the porch, tendencies, two for one, ten a piece
Fuck the ones takin' pleas, add two, twelve deceased
Pour one up for Stephen Clark, then jump in and push the start
If I send this caviar, nigga, I ain't mad at y'all, goddamn

[Chorus]
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch, knock it off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (Where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch, knock it off (Where the cash at?)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Quavo
Bad bitch, go off (Bad, bad)
Cut the top and then I pimp my door off (Skrrt, skrrt)
They too cheap, they lowball (Niggas cheap)
Money stick around like James mohawk (Like 1-3, hoo)
Damn, I just pissed lil' bro off (God damn)
My cuz don't get money, I don't get to know y'all (Aw man)
Brrt, hello? Phone call (Migo, uh)
We gotta feed the dogs (Rr)
Pull up with keys and all (Keys)
The coupe is green, a frog (Woo)
Bring the team, we ball
Crown the kings and (Kings), crown the kings, applaud
Got ya schemin' (Bow, bow), caught ya schemin', pause (Scheme)
We spot the demons (Demons), we spot the demons, God (God)
