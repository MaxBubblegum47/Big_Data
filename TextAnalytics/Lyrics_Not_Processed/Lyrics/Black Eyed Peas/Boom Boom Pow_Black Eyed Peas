[Album Intro]
Welcome
Welcome to The E.N.D
Do not panic, there is nothing to fear
Everything around you is changing
Nothing stays the same
This version of myself is not permanent
Tomorrow, I will be different
The Energy Never Dies
Energy cannot be destroyed, or created
It always is, and it always will be
This is the end, and the beginning..
Forever infinite
Welcome

Yo, I got that hit to beat the block
You can get that bass on below
I got that rock 'n' roll, that future flow
That digital spit, next level visual shit
I got that boom boom boom
How the beat bang? Boom boom boom

[Pre-Chorus: Fergie]
I like that boom boom pow
Them chickens jackin' my style
They try to copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so three thousand and eight
You so two thousand and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now

I'm on that supersonic boom
Y'all hear that spaceship zoom
When I step inside the room
Them girls go apeshit, mmm
Y'all stuck on Super 8 shit
That lo-fi stupid 8-bit
I'm on that HD flat
This beat go boom boom bap

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
I'm a beast when you turn me on
Into the future, cybertron
Harder, faster, better, stronger
Sexy ladies, extra longer
'Cause we got the beat that bounce
We got the beat that pound
We got the beat, that 808
That boom boom in your town

[Bridge: Fergie, will.i.am]
People in the place
If you wanna get down

Yup, yup
