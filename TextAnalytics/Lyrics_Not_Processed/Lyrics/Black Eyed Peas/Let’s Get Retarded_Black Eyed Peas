[Intro: Fergie & apl.de.ap]
Let's get retarded in here
And the bass keeps running, running and runnin runnin'
And runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin, and runnin' runnnin' and...

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect collect the rhythm effect
Obstacles are inefficient, follow your intuiton
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girlies pull they weave out
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
Burn it 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Act up from north, west, east, south

[Pre-Chorus: The Black Eyed Peas]
Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid
Get retarded, get retarded, get retarded

[Chorus: The Black Eyed Peas]
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here), yeah

[Verse 2: Taboo]
Lose control, of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it
Get started, get stupid
Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it
Step by step like an infant new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transmit hits with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'

[Pre-Chorus: The Black Eyed Peas]
Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid
Get retarded, get retarded, get retarded

[Chorus: The Black Eyed Peas]
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded (In here)

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
Let's get ill, that's the deal
Ap the gate, and Will bring the thugged out drill (Just)
Lose your mind, this is the time
Y'all can't stand still, trust and bang your spine (Just)
Bob your head like epilepsy
Up inside the club or in your Bentley
Get messy, loud and sick
You mind pass normal on another head trip
So, come them now, do not correct it
Let's get ignorant, let's get hectic

[Pre-Chorus: The Black Eyed Peas]
Everybody, everybody, just get into it, get stupid
Get retarded, get retarded, get retarded
