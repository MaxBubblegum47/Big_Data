[Verse 1]
Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?
Do people assume
You're always alright?
Been so good at smiling
Most of your life

[Pre-Chorus]
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Does it get hard
To have to play the part?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

[Chorus]
But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Oh

[Verse 2]
Hey, homecoming queen
How's things at home?
Still walking on eggshells
When that curtain's closed?
Did your Daddy teach you
How to act tough?
Or more like your Mama
Sweep it under the rug?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Did you want the crown?
Or does it weigh you down?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

[Chorus]
What if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Yeah, what if I told you the sky wouldn't fall?
If you lost your composure, said to hell with it all
Not everything pretty sparkles and shines
And even the homecoming queen cries (Ooh)
Oh yeah (Ooh)
Even the homecoming queen cries (Ooh)
Mmm-mmm, mmm (Ooh)

[Outro]
Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?
