[Verse 1]
One sided
Everything about your love was one sided
Didn't cover it up or disguise it
You used my dream against me to tie me to you
Two years too many, we tried to get it right
Hit like a shot of tequila without the lime
You've got your reasons and, yeah, I got my rhymes
So this time, this time

[Chorus]
I got myself together, got a new attitude
Hope that I see you never, I'm so over you
Got myself together, you're out of my mind
Now all that I can say is better luck next time, oh
Better luck next time, hey

[Verse 2]
We tried it
But when two hearts don't light up, you can't fight it
And in every storm, there's still silver linin'
And with every day that passes, I find it, oh

[Chorus]
I got myself together, got a new attitude
Hope that I see you never, I'm so over you
Got myself together, you're out of my mind
Now all that I can say is better luck next time, oh

[Bridge]
Blame on mistakes, but we had to roll the dice
Now all that I can say is better luck next time, yeah
Better luck next time, oh

[Chorus]
I got myself together, got a new attitude
Hope that I see you never, I'm so over you
Got myself together, you're out of my mind
Now all that I can say is better luck next time
Better luck next time, oh
Ooh, oh, ooh
