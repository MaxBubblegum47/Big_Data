[Verse 1: Lauren]
I know you don't want me anymore
By the look on your face
They say when it rains it pours
You can tell by my face

[Pre-Chorus: Normani & Camila]
Oh and I know, and you know
That we've been here before
I think I know how it should end
We've got an audience calling us crazy
We ignore
Those with opinions of hate
We're not like the rest of them
Friends with insanity as of lately

[Chorus: Lauren & Normani]
Everyone comes with scars
But you can love them away
I told you that I wasn't perfect
You told me the same
I think that's why we belong
Together and unashamed
I told you that I wasn't perfect, no way
Way, way, no way, no way

[Verse 2: Ally]
When I look in your eyes
I see through to my soul
I know the core of you is good
You're my tarnished hero

[Pre-Chorus: Dinah and Normani]
Oh and I know (I know)
And you know how our story is told (love is told)
Only we know what it is
We've got an audience calling us crazy
We ignore
Those with opinions of hate
We're not like the rest of them
Friends with insanity as of lately

[Chorus: Lauren & Normani]
Everyone comes with scars
But you can love them away
I told you that I wasn't perfect
You told me the same
I think that's why we belong
Together and unashamed
I told you that I wasn't perfect, no way
Way, way, no way, no way

[Outro: Lauren + Normani]
No Way
