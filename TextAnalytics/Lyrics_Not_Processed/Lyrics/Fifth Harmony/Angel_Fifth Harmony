[Intro: Normani & Lauren]
Who said I was an angel?
Who said I was an angel?
Oh yeah

[Verse 1: Normani]
We was just a moment, nothing serious
Never really paid you no mind
Dropped the bag, started paying attention
Should've never lied
Should’ve never not kept your word
Woulda had a reason to keep mine
You was too way inconsistent
Should've never lied

[Pre-Chorus: Lauren]
Should've never crossed that line with ya
Everything was cool, just drinkin’ with ya
Way too young to be up in handcuffs
Wasn't tryna spend my life on the phone with ya
Gotta keep it on one hundred with ya
The original me wouldn't fuck with ya
And I was beginning to fuck with ya

[Chorus: Dinah, with Ally & (Lauren)]
Who said I was an angel?
Who said I was an angel? (Oh yeah)
When you look at me, what do you see?
Open your eyes, I'm more brilliant than you'll ever be
Who said I was an angel?

[Verse 2: Ally]
Yeah, won't lie and say I don't lie
Yeah, I might've told a few lies, yeah
Won’t lie and say I didn’t try
But you're only worth a few tries, yeah
Track star, think you’re running these streets
You ain't the only one running the streets
Stay making ground like I only wear cleats, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Dinah]
Should've never crossed that line with ya
Everything was cool, just drinkin' with ya
Way too young to be up in handcuffs
Wasn’t tryna spend my life on the phone with ya
Gotta keep it on one hundred with ya
The original me wouldn't fuck with ya
And I was beginning to fuck with ya

[Chorus: Dinah + (Normani) & (Ally) & All]
Who said I was an angel? (But you was wrong, oh yeah)
Who said I was an angel? (Oh, I'm no angel, when you look at me)
When you look at me, what do you see? (Oh, what do you see?)
Open your eyes, I'm more brilliant than you'll ever be
Who said I was an angel?
Who said I was an angel? Oh

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want it, I want it, oh, oh, I want it
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I want it, I want it, ah, ah

[Chorus: Normani, Dinah, Both & (Lauren)]
Who said I was an angel? (Who said I was an angel?
Didn't know the real me, I'm far from an angel)
Who said I was an angel? (Never took the time out
Never had time to figure me out, when you look at me)
When you look at me, what do you see? (Oh, what do you see?)
Open your eyes, I'm more brilliant than you'll ever be, yeah
Who said I was an angel?
(Who said I was a, an angel? Oh)
