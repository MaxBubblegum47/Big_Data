[Intro]
Tell me, what's the situation?
I've been rackin' on my brain
Just want some answers if I ask you
But I know you'll never say it to my face
Say it to my face

[Verse 1]
'Cause I've been up in the night
Just tryna be honest
But you're cuttin' the corners though
Holding on close to your pride
You got a good reputation
But it's no revelation
When you've been runnin' all over town
Making a fool of me now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Baby, what's the situation?
I've been rackin' on my brain
Just want some answers if I ask you
But I know you'll never say it to my face
Say it to my face
Tell me, tell me, tell me

[Chorus 1]
Tell me, what's your allegation?
You're accusing me of something
I don't wanna be mistaken
If I ask you, will you say it to my face?
Say it to my face
Tell me, tell me, tell me

[Verse 2]
'Cause you've been bluffin' behind
Those shades that I bought you
Doing it just like I taught you, oh
Can't look me straight in the eye
Too intimidated
But it's no revelation
When you've been runnin' all over town
You're making a fool of me now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Tell me, tell me, tell me
How you got me so frustrated
When you ask me to be patient
Not convicting you with nothing
I'm just asking you to say it to my face
Say it to my face
Tell me, tell me, tell me

[Chorus 2]
Tell me, what's your allegation
You're accusing me of something
I don't wanna be mistaken
I'm just asking you to say it to my face
Say it to my face
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, what's the situation?
Make me come to your location
I'm not good with confrontation
I'm just asking you to say it to my face
Say it to my face
Tell me, tell me, tell me

[Outro]
Tell me, what's the situation?
I've been rackin' on my brain
Just want some answers if I ask you
But I know you'll never say it to my face
Say it to my face
Tell me, tell me, tell me
