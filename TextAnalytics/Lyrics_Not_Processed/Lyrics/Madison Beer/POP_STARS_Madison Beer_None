[Intro: Jaira Burns, Miyeon, Madison Beer, & Soyeon]
Hey, hey, hey
Hey-hey-hey-hey, hey
You know who it is, coming 'round again
You want a dose of this right now
It’s K/DA, uh!

[Verse 1: Soyeon & Madison Beer]
I'm a goddess with a blade
소리쳐봐 내 이름
잊지 못하게 loud, loud, loud, loud
I could take it to the top
절대 멈추지 못해
내가 끝내주는 bad gal, gal, gal
And when I start to talk like that (Like that)
Oh, you won't know how to react
I’m a picture-perfect face with that wild in my veins
You can hear it in my growl, growl, growl, growl

[Pre-Chorus: Miyeon]
So keep your eyes on me now
무엇을 보든 좋아할 거야
닿을 수 없는 level
나와 대결 원한 널 확신해
We got it all in our hands now
So can you handle what we're all about?
We're so tough, not scared to show you up
Can you feel the rush now?

[Chorus: Jaira Burns & All]
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down, down, down, down, down, down
They could try it, but we're gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round, round, round, round, round, round
Wish you luck, but you're not bringing us down
We go hard (Hard) 'til we get it, get it
We go hard (Hard), we so in it, in it
We pop stars (Pop stars), only winning, winning now
Ain't nobody bringing us down, down, down, down

[Verse 2: Soyeon & Madison Beer]
Hey!
You ready for this? (Let’s go)
See 언제든지 내 모습 magic
단 한 번에 내가 잡어
절대 기죽지 않지 uh! (Uh)
Pow pow 네가 뭘 알아 (알아)
견딜 수 없어, 원해도 (해도)
원하는 게 얼굴에 보여
I’m trouble and you're wanting it
I’m so cold (So cold)
When I move that way, you gon' be so blown (So blown)
I'm the realest in the game, uh!
Said I'm on fire with a blade
You’re about to hear my name
Ringing in your head like, whoa

[Pre-Chorus: Miyeon]
So keep your eyes on me now
무엇을 보든 좋아할 거야
We're so tough, not scared to show you up
Can you feel the rush now?

[Chorus: Jaira Burns & All]
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down, down, down, down, down, down
They could try it, but we're gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round, round, round, round, round, round
Wish you luck, but you're not bringing us down
We go hard (Hard) 'til we get it, get it
We go hard (Hard), we so in it, in it
We pop stars (Pop stars), only winning, winning now
Ain't nobody bringing us down, down, down, down

[Bridge: Miyeon & Madison Beer]
Oh, mmm
Oh, 난 멈추지 않아
Oh, oh, we go hard
Oh, oh, we pop stars (Stars), stars (Stars)

[Chorus: Jaira Burns & All]
Ain't nobody bringing us
Ain't nobody bringing us
Down, down, down, down, down, down
They could try it, but we're gonna wear the crown
You could go another round
Round, round, round, round, round, round (Woo-hoo)
Wish you luck, but you're not bringing us down (Oh)
We go hard (Hard) 'til we get it, get it (We go hard)
We go hard (Hard), we so in it, in it
We pop stars (Pop stars), only winning, winning now
Ain't nobody bringing us down, down, down, down
