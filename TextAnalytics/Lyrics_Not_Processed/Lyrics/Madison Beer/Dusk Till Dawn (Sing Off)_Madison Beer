[Conor Maynard] 
(Adele - Hello)
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet

[Madison Beer] 
(Khalid - Location)
Send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through

[Conor Maynard] 
(Alan Walker - Faded)
You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another start, you fade away

[Madison Beer] 
(French Montana - Unforgettable)
'Cause you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Oeh)

[Conor Maynard & Madison Beer] 
(Eminem - Love The Way You Lie)
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts

[Madison Beer] 
(B.o.B - Airplanes)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Conor Maynard] 
(Ellie Goulding - Love Me Like You Do)
So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do (Ohh)

[Madison Beer] 
(Shontelle - Impossible)
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

So, shine bright tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

Why, why
I tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do that way

[Madison Beer] 
(Sam Smith - Stay With Me)
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need

[Conor Maynard] 
(Fall Out Boy - Sugar, We're Goin Down)
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it, Yeah

[Madison Beer] 
(Justin Bieber - Sorry)
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm

[Conor Maynard] 
(Justin Bieber - Sorry)
Missing more than just your body

[Madison Beer] 
(Coldplay - Magic)
And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
No I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you

[Conor Maynard] 
(Madison Beer - Dead)
You say you can't live without me
So why aren't you dead yet?
Why you still breathing?
And you say you can't live without me

[Madison Beer] 
(Cash Cash - All My Love)
How can I sleep when you're out there
With all my love?

[Madison Beer]

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there

[Conor Maynard] 
(Linkin Park - Numb)
Become so tired, so much more aware

[Conor Maynard&Madison Beer] 
(ZAYN - Dusk Till Dawn)
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
