[Verse 1]
Sleepless nights and cigarettes
My daily dose of internet
And all the things I shoulda quit, but never did, oh
Evil voices in my head
I woke up in a stranger's bed
I lost my phone in Amsterdam, it's 5 AM

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a natural disaster
But even after all that I do
It's you who's gonna be the death of me
And none of this matters
Baby, it's you, it's you

[Chorus]
You're bad for my health
I should probably get some help
I can't control myself, I'm addicted to the hell
My heart is getting sick from the tar that's on your lips
Yeah, you're bad for my health
You should hurt somebody else
You're bad for my health
I should probably get some help
I can't control myself, I'm addicted to the hell
My heart is getting sick from the tar that's on your lips
Oh, baby, you're so bad for my health

[Verse 2]
Diets that I shouldn't try, it feels like 
social suicide
And honestly, it's cyanide, 
I'm born to die
Been 21 since 17, thanks to all the magazines
Man, sometimes, I just wanna scream and break my screen

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a natural disaster
But even after all that I do
It's you who's gonna be the death of me
And none of this matters
Baby, it's you, it's you

[Chorus]
You're bad for my health
I should probably get some help
I can't control myself, I'm addicted to the hell
My heart is getting sick from the tar that's on your lips
Yeah, you're bad for my health
You should hurt somebody else
You're bad for my health
I should probably get some help
I can't control myself, I'm addicted to the hell
My heart is getting sick from the tar that's on your lips
Oh, baby, you're so bad for my health

[Bridge]
Dear society, you've pushed me to the edge
So here's some clarity (Clarity)
The truth is, you're the one who's always there for me
With my daily dose of internet
And all the things that I should quit, but can't
Yeah, yeah
(
I can’t sing it, I’m sorry
)
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You're bad for my health
I should probably get some help
I can't control myself, I'm addicted to the hell
My heart is getting sick from the tar that's on your lips
Yeah, you're bad for my health
You should hurt somebody else
You're bad for my health
I should probably get some help
I can't control myself, I'm addicted to the hell
My heart is getting sick from the tar that's on your lips
Oh, baby, you're so bad for my health
