[Intro]
(Ear Drummers)
Haha, yeah, ooh
Yeah, damn
(Turn me up, Fu)

[Chorus]
Poppin' a bean (Ooh, yeah)
I lost my spleen (Oh, yeah)
You ever been so fucked up? (Damn)
I lost all my friends, they broke trust, yo (Yeah, yo)
Never saw myself up in the limelight
Switched up, took flight on a hater
Crashed the whip, I'll see you later
My whip red, it stay Darth Vader
I been telling all y'all this
So y'all gon' act like I'm not big
Like how the fuck I get this far?
How the fuck I drive this car?

[Verse]
Heartbreak soldiers
Xanarchy militia
Yeah I'm coming vicious
Come and take a picture
Yeah you know I'm up next
Yeah you know it's evident
Yeah, ayy, yeah
I might just run up a check on a bit' though, yeah
That bitch suck dick, she go down, she gon' deep-throat
I'm tired of y'all people telling me evil things
Xanarchy, Xanarchy

[Chorus]
Poppin' a bean (Ooh, yeah)
I lost my spleen (Oh, yeah)
You ever been so fucked up? (Damn)
I lost all my friends, they broke trust, yo (Yeah, yo)
Never saw myself up in the limelight
Switched up, took flight on a hater
Crashed the whip, I'll see you later
My whip red, it stay Darth Vader
I been telling all y'all this
So y'all gon' act like I'm not big
Like how the fuck I get this far?
How the fuck I drive this car?
