Pray to God like Allah, please slit my throat

Like this bitch might just be the one (Ayy, ayy)
They use me, they wanna be someone (Yeah, prrah)
Like, go and get yourself a job (Yeah, ayy)
I cannot be compared to y'all (Yeah, what?)
And if I do not make it, tell my mom this life is fake (Ayy, what?)
And I don't wanna see mistakes, same ones I made when I was basic (Yeah, ayy)
(When I was basic, yeah, when I was basic, yeah)

Stuck inside my mind, I need some peace, I need a dojo
Said I'm stuck inside my mind (Yeah), I need some peace, I need a dojo (Prr, prr, prr)

[Chorus: Lil Xan]
Pray to God like Allah, please slit my throat
And when you lie, I wanna die, please slit my throat

Pray to God like Allah, please slit my throat
And when you lie, I wanna die, please slit my throat
You seen me high, almost died, wanna slit my throat
They gon' cry when you die 'cause that just how it go

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Okay, so this little light of mine
Tattoos all down my spine
Everybody know that I'm on my grind
Always at a place where the sun don't shine
The media wanna make me a bad guy
I don't know if I'm happy, you're right
I stay inside and I pray up to Christ
Hopin' one day I don't end my life
Way too depressed to express how I feel
Only smoke weed, sometimes on pills
Shit's a nightmare, I don't know what's real
She came back around since I got that deal
I don't want friends, I want happiness
She did me dirty, it's fuck that bitch
I was so broke but now I'm rich
Still the same gang, still the same clique
Xanarchy shit, tell that ho, "Make a wish"
Feel the touch when we kiss
My hands on her hips, fell in love with her lips
Make her swallow my kids
The world is so evil while we lost in the mix
Tryna make it make sense
So I wanna know, does it matter to you
That I don't have no fucks to give? Bitch

[Chorus: Lil Xan, Lil Xan & Lil Skies]
Pray to God like Allah, please slit my throat
And when you lie, I wanna die, please slit my throat
You seen me high, almost died, wanna slit my throat
They gon' cry when you die 'cause that just how it go
Pray to God like Allah, please slit my throat
And when you lie, I wanna die, please slit my throat
You seen me high, almost died, wanna slit my throat
They gon' cry when you die 'cause that just how it go

[Outro: Lil Xan, Lil Skies, & Both]
Ayy, that's just how it go, that's just how it go
I never wanna ever wanna let you go (Just how it go)
That's just how it go, that's just how it go
I ain't never, ever, ever wanna let you go (Just how it go)
Yeah, ayy, oh
Yeah, ayy, oh
Out the booth, out the booth, out the booth
Yeah!
