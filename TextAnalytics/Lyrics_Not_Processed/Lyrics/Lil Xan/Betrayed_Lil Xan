[Intro]
Huh, ayy (Yeah)
You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat
What? Yeah, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Pop the trunk, I open up
I sold my soul, a good price, outta sight
And my ho got talent, right?
Whole squad ran through that shit, yikes
Ayy, I'm a business man, I did my business, damn
And I'ma bend it down, then I'ma lick her up
And then dick her down, she gon' turn around
Then I'ma kick her out, she gon' talk that shit but still
Ayy, how you make it up? How you fake a love?
Holy son, I was the chosen one
I'm sippin' out the grail, she don't kiss and tell
She keep my wishes well, I don't need her, well
Oh, yeah, how my enemy a friend of me?
Why y'all feed off of my energy?
Like I ain't dead yet, higher entity
Foreign bitch that think she into me
Whip the foreign very viciously
Why these dudes wanna take pics with me?
She said she gay, but still into me
She said she gay, still into me
Said she hate that I'm in the streets
And I said I hate that I'm in the streets
I wanna blow up and make history
Said she hate my Insta' feed

[Chorus]
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
And Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you (Yeah, ayy)

[Verse 2]
And her pussy tastes like Skittles, what? Yeah, ayy
You can really taste the rainbow, what? Hah, no
Your bitch just like a Crayola, what? Ayy
You can draw her on the table, flip her like some yola
Ayy, heart-shaped kisses, I really miss my mistress
And 666, evil bitches want my mentions
Heart-shaped kisses, really miss my mistress
And it's 666, evil bitches want my mentions

[Chorus]
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
And Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you

[Outro]
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' take you
What? Ayy, what? Ayy
Xans gon' take
Xans gon' take you
Yeah, Xans gon'
Xans' gon take you
Ayy, Xans gon' take you
