[Intro: Kelly Rowland]
Ladies, y'all wanna do it again
Bey, go on Michelle

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
I really hate to see that look on your face
You're lookin' like someone came and rained on your parade
And I know it kills to feel those tears in your eyes
But I guess your conscience finally caught up with your lies
But when my tears dropped, where the hell were you?
But it's okay, boy, I've changed, and I ain't been there waiting
So I won't pretend to feel bad for you
Cause since you left, I ain't cried since
And boy, I like it that way

[Hook: Kelly Rowland]
I can say "I'm done" in a million ways
But let's not beat around the bush, let's cut to the chase
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late
And now I'm so through, too cool, oh yeah
And if our love was a game, you just lost
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late

[Verse 2: Beyonc√©]
I know you hate to see this look on my face
I'm sure that you can see real clear, a little lying goes a long way
And if you think I'll waste my tears, boy you're crazy
And maybe you should get yourself admitted, don't delay
But you let the bomb drop, too bad for you
But it's okay, boy, I'm straight, my whole life's amazing
So I won't pretend to feel bad for you
Cause since you left, I ain't cried since
And boy, I like it that way

[Hook: Kelly Rowland]
I can say "I'm done" in a million ways
But let's not beat around the bush, let's cut to the chase
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late
And now I'm so through, too cool, oh yeah
And if our love was a game, you just lost
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late

[Verse 3: Michelle Williams]
Now you wanna claim you got a clue
Boy, what'd you expect for me to do?
You claim you wanna have a life or two
But you can save your "sorry's" and your "I love you" too

[Hook: Kelly Rowland]
I can say "I'm done" in a million ways
But let's not beat around the bush, let's cut to the chase
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late
And now I'm so through, too cool, oh yeah
And if our love was a game, you just lost
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late

[Outro: Kelly Rowland]
Change just in time
Just in time for me to change my mind
And it's too late
Boy, I changed
It's too bad for you, oh-oh
For I changed my mind
I don't want you no-no more
'Cause see, you changed, I changed
You changed, but it's too late, it's too late
Sorry
