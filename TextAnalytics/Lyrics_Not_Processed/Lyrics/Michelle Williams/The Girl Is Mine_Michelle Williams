[Intro: Brandy]
Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?

[Verse: Destiny’s Child]
Take a minute girl, come sit down
What's been happening? What's been happening?
Take a minute, take a minute girl
Take a minute girl, come sit down
What's been happening? What's been happening?
Take a minute, take a minute girl
Come too far for you to feel alone
Don't let him walk over your heart
We've come too far for you to feel alone
In your face, I can see passion
Come too far for you to feel alone
Don't let him walk over your heart
We've come too far for you to feel alone
In your face, I can see passion

[Chorus: Brandy & Destiny's Child]
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine (Girl)
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine (Girl)
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine (Girl)
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine, mine, mine, mine
Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
You're my girl, you're my
You're my girl
You're my girl, you're my girl

[Verse: Destiny’s Child]
Take a minute girl, come sit down
What's been happening? (What's been happening?)
What's been happening? (What's been happening?)
Take a minute, take a minute girl
Take a minute girl, come sit down
What's been happening? (What's been happening?)
What's been happening? (What's been happening?)
Take a minute, take a minute girl
Come too far for you to feel alone
Don't let him walk over your heart
We've come too far for you to feel alone
In your face, I can see passion
Come too far for you to feel alone
Don't let him walk over your heart
We've come too far for you to feel alone
In your face, I can see passion

[Chorus: Brandy & Destiny's Child]
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine (Girl)
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine (Girl)
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine (Girl)
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine (Girl)

[Verse 3: Brandy & Destiny's Child]
Think it's time we got this straight, let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way I could mistake, the girl is mine
Think it's time we got this straight, let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way I could mistake, the girl is mine, mine, mine, mine

[Chorus: Brandy & Destiny's Child]
Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine (Girl)
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine (Girl)
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine (Girl)
It's not hard to see, the girl is mine, mine, mine, mine
Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
