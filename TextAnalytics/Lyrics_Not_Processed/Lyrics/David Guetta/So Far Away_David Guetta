[Verse 1: Jamie Scott]
Light 'em up, light 'em up
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
The summer nights, the bright lights
And the shooting stars, they break my heart

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jamie Scott]
I'm calling you now, but you're not picking up
Your shadows so close if you are still in love
Then light a match, light a match
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are

[Chorus: Jamie Scott]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

[Post-Chorus: Jamie Scott]
So far away

[Verse 2: Romy Dya]
It's breaking me, I'm losing you
We were far from perfect, but we were worth it
Too many fights, and we cried, but never said we're sorry
Stop saying you love me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Romy Dya]
You're calling me now, but I can't pick up
Your shadow's too close, and I'm still in love
The summer's over now, but somehow, it still breaks my heart
We could have had the stars, oh

[Chorus: Jamie Scott & Romy Dya / Jamie Scott]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

[Post-Chorus: Romy Dya /  Romy Dya & Jamie Scott]
So far away
So far away
Oh, so far away
So far away

[Outro: Romy Dya]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day when you're so far away
