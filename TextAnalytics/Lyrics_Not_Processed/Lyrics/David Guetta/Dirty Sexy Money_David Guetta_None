[Intro: Charli XCX]
Woah, whoo

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Woah, whoo
I want you bad, want you bad, want you bad
Saw you in the moonlight
Think you lookin' fine, want you bad
It got me good, never turn back (ooh)
I'll make you mine, make you mine, make you mine
Coming for the taking, promise you I'm wearing the crown
Number one, spin your head around

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Whoo, tell me what you want and I can do it to you
I'm a million dollars, make your wishes come true
Calling out, you're calling out, you're calling out
You've never seen a girl like this before

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on, spend that dirty, sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
If you wanna do-do-do-do-do it freaky
24/7, no-no-no-no-no sleep
Come on, put that dirty, sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
Put your skin on my skin, on my skin
Love it when we touchin', love it when we fuckin', my love
Make you high in a heartbeat, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Whoo, tell me what you want and I can do it to you
I'm a million dollars, make your wishes come true
Calling out, you're calling out, you're calling out
You've never seen a girl like this before

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on, spend that dirty, sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
If you wanna do-do-do-do-do it freaky
24/7, no-no-no-no-no sleep
Come on, put that dirty, sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Clap, clap, clap, clap, go on, move your body
Clap, clap, clap, clap, baby, move your body
Clap, clap, clap, clap, you ain't gotta fight it
Clap, clap, clap, clap, what you need, I got it
Louis shoes, cop boots, top down, you
Diamond juice, all I see is you, right now, you
All I want is you, you, tunnel vision, you, you
All I need is you, I'ma bet it on you, you

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
If you wanna pu-pu-pu-pu-put it on me
You're not gonna ge-ge-ge-ge-get it for free
Come on, spend that dirty, sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
If you wanna do-do-do-do-do it freaky
24/7, no-no-no-no-no sleep
Come on, put that dirty, sexy money on me, on me, on me
You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
