Skooly
]
Uh
Yeah
Oh, that's London On Da Track, run that shit back
We got 
London On Da Track

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Swervin’
How you look so perfect on your worst days?
Double C your purses, you deserve it
Niggas in your DM, they be thirsty (Thirsty), and in person
But you're curvin'
Curvy little body, love your surface (Surface)
Yeah, I’m all on your body, make you nervous
I like the way you keep up with your earnings
Yeah, it's okay, 'cause you swervin'

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
I fuck you from the back and leave you turnin' (Turnin')
The type to make you feel like I'm so worth it (Worth it)
Blame my ex, that bitch, she did me dirty (Did me dirty)
Had me fall in love and then she curved me
(on God, swear to God, I don't wanna leave you, no)
New Louboutin, you would think I’m bleedin’ from my toes
Dick all inside of you, make you freeze, make you pose
I want you to get up on your knees and your toes
I see one of my enemies, they gon' freeze like they cold
I swear I ain’t no killer, but test me if you want
You don't want my adrenaline rushin', leave me alone (Leave me alone)
So much shit up on my mind, I can't think, yeah
All my niggas rock designer like they scream (Grrat)
Got the AP covered, diamonds with baguettes, yeah
I thought everything was right, that’s when you left, yeah

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Swervin' (Swervin')
How you look so perfect on your worst days? (Worst days)
Double C your purses, you deserve it
Niggas in your DM, they be thirsty (Thirsty), and in person (Person)
But you're curvin'
Curvy little body, love your surface (Surface)
Yeah, I'm all on your body, make you nervous
I like the way you keep up with your earnings
Yeah, it's okay, you be swervin'

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Where these bitches at? I'm in the V with the tints
Got the FN on my body and the clip on hollow tips
Niggas say they gon' rob me and they still ain't do shit
Catch her waitin' in the lobby, I'ma give her this dick
Man, where these niggas at? Man, where these niggas at?
We gon' pull up big bodies with the Rugers in the back
I got Rugers and the MAC's, pump leave a nigga flat
Talkin' hot, we spin the block, we gon' leave him where he at

[Verse 3: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Like, where these niggas at? Ayy, where these niggas at?
I'ma pull up in the big body with the fuckin' MAC
If the opps try to turn my song off, run it back
Used to have the pack in my long johns, now I rap

[Verse 4: 6ix9ine]
If a nigga wanna act out, got the MAC out
I ain't got no fuckin' back-up, that's a man down
I ain't got the fuckin' forty, knock his teeth out
Spin back with the Ruger, air the block out

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Swervin' (Swervin')
How you look so perfect on your worst days? (Worst days)
Double C your purses, you deserve it
Niggas in your DM, they be thirsty (Thirsty), and in person (Person)
But you're curvin'
Curvy little body, love your surface (Surface)
Yeah, I'm all on your body, make you nervous
I like the way you keep up with your earnings
Yeah, it's okay, 'cause you swervin'

[Outro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie & 
Skooly
]
The way that I live my life is amazing
Back to back big bodies, no more dreams, yeah
So much shit up on my mind, I couldn't think, yeah
All my niggas rock designer like they scream, yeah
Got the AP covered, diamonds with baguettes, yeah
Say my name in your song and it's lit, yeah
Been waiting for a nigga like this, yeah
We got London On Da Track
