[Intro: Young Thug & 
Skooly
]
Yeah
I'm so through with that
I'm so through with that
(
We got London on da Track
)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hundred bands, hundred bands
Dropped on the head of any nigga want it, man (Woo)
Pop me a Xanny, I'm fast
I'm so fast, I'm so faster than Sonic, man (Woo)
True the man, true the man, true to my nigga
True Religion Buddha man (Woo)
My money stack tall as Ludacris' afro
And I swear I'ma shoot with that (Woo)
I just hit for nine birds, what I'ma do with that?
Pull up on the curb, then you hop out and be through with that (Ooh)
I'm so fresh like dish detergent
If you not fresh, you so through with that (So fresh)
If you are a nerd, everything here, you not cool with that

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Yes, you not cool
No, you not bool (What?)
I don't give no damn, I'm not calling you boo (Uh-uh)
My bitch, she a jewel (Whoa)
You can't prove a point, boy, you know you so doomed (You dig?)
You know you so doomed (Yeah)
I swear I'm so lost with no clue, don't know what to do (What?)
Over loud, over loud (Yeah)
I over loud on these niggas
Ain't know how to milk these cows
She made that dick grow, now it's big like a tower
Yow, front pockets filled up with bands, no Bible

[Chorus: Young Thug & 
Lil Duke

Hundred bands, hundred bands
Dropped on the head of any nigga want it, man (Woo)
Pop me a Xanny, I'm fast
I'm so fast, I'm so faster than Sonic, man (Woo, woo)
True the man, true the man, true to my nigga
True Religion Buddha man (True it, woo)
My money stack tall as Ludacris' afro
And I swear I'ma shoot with that (Sheesh, sheesh)
I just hit for nine birds, what I'ma do with that? (Sheesh, sheesh)
Pull up on the curb, then you hop out and be through with that (Skrrt)
I'm so fresh like dish detergent
If you not fresh, you so through with that (
Clean

If you are a nerd, everything here, you not cool with that (
Hey, dork
)

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Pull up, hop out the block
They tuck in they tail, I go, "Who the clan?" (Cacaw, cacaw)
We dressed in all-black, I'm always on the road just like a Uber man (I'm textin')
We wrappin' and sendin' them packs
Soon as they land, we movin' 'em (Wrapped, shipped)
Blame it on the OGs, they influenced me (I'm ridin' with felons)
Ain't gonna count money, nigga (Uh-uh, nah)
I ain't just met money, nigga (Ain't just met money, nigga)
I put lipstick on the 'Rari, she say that's delicious (Skrr-skrr-skrr-skrr)
Who that is in that Crown Vic? He look suspicious (Oh, him, shh)
I just jugged a hundred pounds, I made aâ€”

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hundred bands, hundred bands
Dropped on the head of any nigga want it, man (Woo, woo)

True the man, true the man, true to my nigga
True Religion Buddha man (Sheesh, woo)

And I swear I'ma shoot with that (Yeah, sheesh, sheesh)
I just hit for nine birds, what I'ma do with that? (Hey)
Pull up on the curb, then you hop out and be through with that (Skrrt-skrrt)
I'm so fresh like dish detergent
If you not fresh, you so through with that (Fresh)
If you are a nerd, everything here, you not cool with that
