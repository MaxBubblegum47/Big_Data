[Intro]
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't think I love you, my emotions aren't the same
I'd rather be alone than go hangout with some lames
It's funny how they judge you when they see you made a change
I poured another four just to take away the pain
My friends weren't my friends, they was lookin' for some clout
I had what they wanted so they always came around
You told me you would be there but you never held it down
I'm out here bein' loyal, now I'm lookin' like a clown
I popped another Addy, now my heart is speedin' up
And I don't wanna love you, shorty, I just wanna fuck
Got angels on my shoulders, I got demons in my cup
I'm hardly ever out because it's hard for me to trust

[Chorus]
Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here

[Bridge]
But I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos
I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos

[Verse 2]
Roll a blunt and relax, ease your mind (Ease your mind)
I'ma be here for a while, take your time (Take your time)
Lock the doors, spill your heart, never lie (Never lie)
And they talk about me now 'cause I'm that guy (Guy)
They say I needed help but I did this by myself (By myself)
Smokin' all the time, hardly thinkin' 'bout my health
I just been alone, I'm not thinkin' that it helps
They threw me in a fire and expected me to melt
I came out a warrior, I had to make it last
I'm not the type to worry 'bout a problem in the past
And I just keep on movin' knowin' that I made this path
These bitches say they love you but will switch up for some cash
I put myself in college, I was taught that that was right
Well, now I'm 18 and I see that's not my life
I'm under too much pressure, feel like I can't take advice
You only live once, fuck the rules, I'm takin' flight
My niggas in the cage, free 'em out, fuck the law
I swear when they get out, on my life, we gonna ball
You wanna be a great, be yourself, fuck them all
Explain myself too much, now I'm feelin' lockjaw

[Chorus]
Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here

[Outro]
But I can't do no fake friends (Fake friends)
No, I can't do no fake friends (Fake friends)
No, I can't do no fake hoes (Fake hoes)
No, I can't do no fake bros (Fake bros)
I just need the pesos (Pesos)
