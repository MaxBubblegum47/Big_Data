[Intro]
One time just a little bit, I
Go 'head, O
One time just a little bit, I
One time just a little bit, I
I, I
Danny, I see you

[Chorus]
I, I, I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, no horoscope

[Verse 1]
Life goes on, I can't take breaks
I need face, no, I need faith
In my mind, I can't escape
I climb these heights like I'm an ape
Shine so bright in a world so dark
Break the bank, I'ma break the chart
Two door coupe, just push to start
Climb right in, let me break your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
Still never sober
Still never sober
Got the world on my shoulders
Comin' out bolder
Yeah, I'm comin' out bolder
I ride with my soldiers
Ride for my soldiers
Thought that I told you
I thought that I told you

[Chorus]
I, I, I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, no horoscope
I, I, I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, no horoscope, I-I-I

[Verse 2]
I don't want the fame
I don't want to play these games
Tired of hiding from the pain
Never hanging with the lames, I
I'm not the one for the stupid shit
We shot a scene on some movie shit
And she came right through on some groupie shit
Be surprised how they act when they know you lit

[Chorus]
I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
And I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times no horoscope
I, I, I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
And I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, nigga, yes I smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times no horoscope, I
