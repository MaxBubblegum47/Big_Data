[Intro]
Menoh

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need (World that you need)
We get high to pass time, but bitch, I ain't no fiend (I ain't no fiend)
I got money on my mind, I be stackin' my green (Stacking my green)
Shawty say she like my style, I be dripping with ease (Dripping with ease)
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased (Like to be teased)
Say she got that super soaker, well, girl, just let me see (Just let me see)
I ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me (Ain't scaring me)
I was destined for this life, it's in my destiny (My destiny)
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most (Doing the most)
How you tell me you my bro, then you went out and told? (Went out and told)
Niggas say they down to ride, but be folding like clothes (Folding like clothes)
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul (Ain't trusting a soul)

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
I roll up the mary jane, no, they can't feel my pain
I'm still trapping every day, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout, get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl, but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a pornstar, a rockstar
Tryna skrrt off in that fast car like NASCAR
Girl, you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart?
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light 'cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki, yeah, she like it sloppy
Oh, you got a hottie body, come ride on my johnny
I'ma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste?
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights, I'm flyin', no, you can't see me
Say you need me, but you deceive me

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need (World that you need)
We get high to pass time, but bitch, I ain't no fiend (I ain't no fiend)
I got money on my mind, I be stackin' my green (Stacking my green)
Shawty say she like my style, I be dripping with ease (Dripping with ease)
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased (Like to be teased)
Say she got that super soaker, well, girl, just let me see (Just let me see)
I ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me (Ain't scaring me)
I was destined for this life, it's in my destiny (My destiny)
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most (Doing the most)
How you tell me you my bro, then you went out and told? (Went out and told)
Niggas say they down to ride, but be folding like clothes (Folding like clothes)
Now purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul (Ain't trusting a soul)

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
Said I ain't never forgotten not a soul worth remembering
'Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
'Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a goddamn rockstar
That blunt ash on the floor
Well, she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know, toke
Took a drag out that 'Wood, now she goin' for my wood
So we goin' to my hood, yeah, she gonna get it good
Yeah, she know who we are
She want this rockstar life, and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more
Yeah, she off a bar, and she can't feel her face no more
She said she can't feel her face no more
