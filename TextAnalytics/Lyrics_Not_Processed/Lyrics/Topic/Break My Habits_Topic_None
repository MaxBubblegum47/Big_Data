[Verse 1]
This is not like me, I don't get that deep
I'm usually puttin' all my walls up in-between
I cannot fight this 'cause you make me weak
My heart is pumpin' like it's following the beat

[Pre-Chorus]
You have got me feelin' like I'm trippin'
Seen a lot of shit, but you're the real thing
Nothing like a lovin' that I've witnessed
When you're with me

[Chorus]
So just feel my touch and let it
Make you feel alright
And I might just break my habits
And stay with you tonight
I'll break my habits
I'll break my habits
And stay with you tonight

[Post-Chorus]
I'll break my habits

[Verse 2]
Always thought I've been fine on my own
Now I'm relying on your love to get it on

[Pre-Chorus]
You have got me feelin' like I'm trippin'
Seen a lot of shit, but you're the real thing
Nothing like a lovin' that I've witnessed
When you're with me

[Chorus]
So just feel my touch and let it
Make you feel alright
And I might just break my habits
And stay with you tonight
I'll break my habits
I'll break my habits

[Post-Chorus]
I'll break my habits

[Bridge]
All that I need is a quick fix from you, baby
Don't wanna leave 'cause I give something new, so I'll

[Chorus]
I'll break my habit
I'll break my habits
