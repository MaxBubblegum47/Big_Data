I love you truly, truly dear
Life with it's sorrow, life with it's tear
Fades into dreams when I feel you are near
For I love you truly
Truly dear!

A love 'tis something, to feel your kind hand

Ah yes, 'tis something, by your side to stand
Gone is the sorrow, gone doubt and fear
For you love me truly
Truly dear!
