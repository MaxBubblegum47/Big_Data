[Intro]
(Happy Christmas, Kyoko
Happy Christmas, Julian)

[Pre-Chorus]
So this is Christmas
And what have you done?
Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you had fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

[Chorus]
A very Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

[Verse 1]
And so this is Christmas (War is over)
For weak and for strong (If you want it)
For rich and the poor ones (War is over)
The road is so long (Now)
And so happy Christmas (War is over)
For black and for white (If you want it)
For yellow and red ones (War is over)
Let's stop all the fight (Now)

[Chorus]
A very Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

[Pre-Chorus]
And so this is Christmas (War is over)
And what have we done? (If you want it)
Another year over (War is over)
And a new one just begun (Now)
And so happy Christmas (War is over)
We hope you had fun (If you want it)
The near and the dear ones (War is over)
The old and the young (Now)

[Chorus]
A very Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

[Outro]
War is over, if you want it
War is over, now
Happy Christmas
Happy Christmas, Christmas
Happy Christmas, Christmas
