[Verse 1]
I was dreaming of the past
And my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control
I began to lose control

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy

[Verse 2]
I was feeling insecure
You might not love me anymore
I was shivering inside
I was shivering inside

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy

[Instrumental Verse]

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy

[Verse 3]
I was trying to catch your eyes
Thought that you was trying to hide
I was swallowing my pain
I was swallowing my pain

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
Watch out, I'm just a jealous guy
Look out baby, I'm just a jealous guy
