[Verse 1]
There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, "seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
[Verse 2]
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?
[Verse 3]
There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me
[Verse 4]
Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
[Verse 5]
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
[Verse 6]
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
[Outro]
Someone to watch over me
