[Chorus]
Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry

[Verse 1]
One of these mornings
You're gonna rise up singing
Yes you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
But 'til that morning
There ain't nothin' can harm you
With Daddy and Mammy standin' by

[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry
Oh don't you cry
Oh don't you cry
Don't you cry
Oh don't you cry
