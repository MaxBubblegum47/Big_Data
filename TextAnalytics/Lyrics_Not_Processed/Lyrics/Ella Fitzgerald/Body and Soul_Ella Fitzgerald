My heart is sad and lonely!
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, Body and Soul
I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you, I mean it
I'm all for you, Body and Soul!
I can't believe it
Its hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending?
It looks like the ending!--
Unless, I can have
One more chance to prove dear..
My life a wreck you're making!
You know I'm yours
For just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you, Body and Soul!
