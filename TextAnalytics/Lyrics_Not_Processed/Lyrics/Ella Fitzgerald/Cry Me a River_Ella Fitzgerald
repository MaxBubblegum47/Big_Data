[Verse 1]
Now you say you're lonely
You cried the long night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried, cried, cried a river over you

[Chorus]
You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and

[Verse 2]
Now you say, you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
Cause I cried a river over you

[Chorus]
You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, remember, all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and
Now, now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry, cry, cry me a river, cry me a river
Cause I cried a river over you

[Verse 3]
If my pillow could talk, imagine what it would have said
Could it be a river of tears I cried in bed?
So you can cry me a river
Daddy, go ahead and cry that river
Cause I cried, how I cried a river over you
How I cried a river over you
