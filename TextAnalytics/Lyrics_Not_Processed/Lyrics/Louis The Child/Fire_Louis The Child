[Verse 1: Evalyn]
Lookin' up, starlight
Take me there, yeah I wanna fly
Want gold, bankroll
Wanna feel the rush to the front row
Paycheck, late again
Barely hangin' on to the apartment
Doin' it my way
Ain't nothin' free 'bout the free way

[Pre-Chorus: Evalyn]
But I'm miles off the ground
I'm leavin' this whole mad city to burn
And I'll watch it go down, ooh
'Cause that sun gon' take me with it, hey

[Chorus: Evalyn]
And I'm buildin' a fire, fire, oh
I'm buildin' it higher, higher, oh
I'm gonna run this empire higher, oh
And if I go down in flames, the smoke gonna spell my name

[Verse 2: Evalyn]
Lipstick, red wine
Long nights, it's a lifestyle
So good to the last drop
You could see me light up from the rooftops

[Pre-Chorus: Evalyn]
But I'm miles off the ground
I'm leavin' this whole mad city to burn
And I'll watch it go down, ooh
'Cause that sun gon' take me with it, hey

[Chorus: Evalyn]
And I'm buildin' a fire, fire, oh
I'm buildin' it higher, higher, oh
I'm gonna run this empire higher, oh
And if I go down in flames, the smoke gonna spell my name
And I'm buildin' a fire, fire, oh
I'm buildin' it higher, higher, oh
I'm gonna run this empire higher, oh
And if I go down in flames, the smoke gonna spell my name
