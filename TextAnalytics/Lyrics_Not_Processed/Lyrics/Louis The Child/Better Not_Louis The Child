[Verse 1]
I know it's hard to admit it that you found love
It's hard to stay in it, but he's better
Than anyone I've seen you with before
So talk to me, tell me 'bout all your insecurities
And I'm tryna make you see what I see
You're happier than I've ever seen you

[Chorus]
It's true love, don't fake it
You better not, you better not
It's right here, don't waste it
You better not, you better not
Don't say you can't figure it out, figure it out
I know you can figure it out, figure it out
It's true love, don't waste it
You better not, you better not

[Post-Chorus]
You better not

[Verse 2]
Don't overthink it
Let it go and try to trust the feeling
You know it in your gut you're healing
From every time that you've been hurt before
I see it, I see it

[Chorus]
It's true love, don't fake it
You better not, you better not
It's right here, don't waste it
You better not, you better not
Don't say you can't figure it out, figure it out
I know you can figure it out, figure it out
It's true love, don't waste it
You better not, you better not

[Post-Chorus]
You better not
You better not

[Bridge]
I know you can figure it out, figure it out
It's true love, don't waste it
Don't say you can't figure it out, figure it out
You better not, you better not

[Post-Chorus]
You better not
You better not

[Outro]
It's true love, don't fake it
You better not, you better not
It's right here, don't waste it
You better, you better not
