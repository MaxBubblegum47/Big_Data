[Spoken Intro: Elohim]
For sure

[Verse 1: Elohim]
There's no one else here around me
Sinkin' my feet in the sand
I'll be right here on this island
I hope that you understand

[Pre-Chorus: Elohim]
Oooooh, yeah
I'm feelin' it, I'm feelin' it
Oooooh, yeah
Come to me quick, come to me quick

[Chorus: Elohim]
I just wanna go where love is alive
Love is alive, love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive
Love is alive, love is alive
Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
Oh, I just wanna go where love is alive
So, I'm gonna do that

[Refrain: Elohim]
I just wanna go where love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive

[Verse 2: Elohim]
All of the chaos surrenders
Changin' the currents and tide
The water can keep gettin' deeper
'Cause I'll be right here stayin' dry

[Pre-Chorus: Elohim]
Oooooh, yeah
I'm feelin' it, I'm feelin' it
Oooooh, yeah
Come to me quick, come to me quick

[Chorus: Elohim]
I just wanna go where love is alive
Love is alive, love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive
Love is alive, love is alive
Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
Oh, I just wanna go where love is alive
So, I'm gonna do that
I just wanna go where love is alive
So, I'm gonna do that
I just wanna go where love is alive
Love is alive, love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive
Love is alive, love is alive
Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
Oh, I just wanna go where love is alive
So, I'm gonna do that

[Refrain: Elohim]
I just wanna go where love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive
So, I'm gonna do that

[Pre-Chorus: Elohim]
Ooh, yeah
I'm feelin' it, I'm feelin' it
Ooh, yeah
Come to me quick, come to me quick
Ooh, yeah
I'm feelin' it, I'm feelin' it
Ooh, yeah
Come to me quick, come to me quick

[Chorus: Elohim]
I just wanna go where love is alive
Love is alive, love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive
Love is alive, love is alive
Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
