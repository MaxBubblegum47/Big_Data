[Intro]
Captain Crunch presents

[Hook: Jay Critch]
I'm sippin' on juice, smokin' that pack, yeah
Hop out a coupe, step in the Loubs, check out my fashion
I was just tryna be cool, diamonds attackin'
I get me a check, don't know how to act, ah
I get the bag, ah, like The North Face
I get the cash now, she givin' more face
These niggas mad, ha ha, I'm gettin' more cake
Ain't goin' out sad, nah, nah, nah

[Verse 1: Jay Critch]
AP for the timing, know they hate me, how I'm shinin'
Know they see the money pilin', and my roof gone, gotta find it
Signed up, change the climate, ah
She fell in love with the diamonds
I had to get it on my own
Come get your shorty, she be wildin'
And I had to, change the number to my phone
Then it's right back to the thousands
Big racks, boy, you don't know nothin' 'bout it
Gotta flex up on these niggas 'cause they doubtin'
I've been ballin' on these niggas so they foulin'
She gon' do it with no hands, she got talent

[Hook: Jay Critch]
I'm sippin' on juice, smokin' that pack, yeah
Hop out a coupe, step in the Loubs, check out my fashion
I was just tryna be cool, diamonds attackin'
I get me a check, don't know how to act, ah
I get the bag, ah, like the North Face
I get the cash now, she givin' more face
These niggas mad, ha ha, I'm gettin' more cake
Ain't going out sad, nah nah nah

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
YSL tag, big Prada bag
Quarter mil' cash, I was down bad
Bring your friends, we could fuck, I don't do dates
Fifty thousand on a lawyer for a court case
I'm actually ballin', fuck her one time, think I'm actually callin'
These niggas is salty
I came from the bottom, designer all on me
Who knew this would happen
From trappin' to rappin', but now I'm in fashion
The finest of fabrics
Too many bands, they doin' gymnastics
Hop out the coupe
My young niggas might shoot out the roof
I got the juice
They was hatin', I was playing it cool
Damn, I said I won't miss you
I'm in love with the money, I can't kiss you (Rich)
