[Intro]
Luther, Clarence, Lisa, Darlene, Brenda, Cissy, Tawatha, Fonzi, Kevin, Cindy, Paulette, Robin
Merry Christmas, everybody

[Verse 1: Luther Vandross + 
Darlene Love
]
Christmas memories still remind me of you
I wanna be (wanna be, wanna be) closer to you
And I wish you were closer to me
Every song they play this time of year
Every melody that I hear, every minute I wish
I wish you were near

[Pre-Chorus: Luther Vandross + 
Darlene Love
]
Something's missin' (
something's missin'
), must be you (
must be you
)
So I listen when the bells start ringin'
My heart starts singin'

[Chorus: Luther Vandross + 
Darlene Love
]
I listen to the bells
And they make me remember
When we were so in love
It was only last year, this time in December
I listen to the bells
And I reminisce
I hear those Christmas bells
But I never knew that I could miss you like this

[Verse 2: Luther Vandross + 
Darlene Love
]
Love the lights and everything under the tree
Friends come around (celebrate, celebrate)
They have a good time
But it's not a party for me
(Call up Santa)
Tell him that I've been blue
Tell him it's hard for me
 (for me, for me)
It's been a blue holiday, 'cause I'm missin' you

[Pre-Chorus: Luther Vandross + 
Darlene Love
]
I keep wishin' (
I keep wishin'
), wondering if you'll 
think of me
So I listen when the bells start ringin'
My heart starts singin'

[Chorus: Luther Vandross + 
Darlene Love
]
I listen to the bells
And they make me remember
When we were so in love
It was only last year, this time in December
I listen to the bells
And I reminisce
I hear those Christmas bells
But I never knew that I could miss you like this

[Bridge: Luther Vandross + 
Darlene Love
]
Ready, baby?
Uh-huh
Well, come on...

[Clarence Clemons saxophone solo]
Go on, Mr. Clemons!
Clarence, please, ha ha

[Pre-Chorus: Luther Vandross + 
Darlene Love
]
Something's missin' (
something's missin'
), must be you (
must be you
)
So I listen when the bells start ringin'
My heart starts singin'

[Chorus: Luther Vandross + 
Darlene Love
]
I listen to the bells
And they make me remember
When we were so in love
It was only last year, this time in December
I listen to the bells
And I reminisce
 (About me?)
I hear those Christmas bells
But I never knew that I could miss you like this

[Outro: 
Luther
 & 
Darlene
 + (background)]
Honey (I listen to the bells)
Sugar (And they make me remember)
Don't you miss me? Don't you miss me?
Come back, baby (When we were so in love
It was only last year, this time in December)
Honey (I listen to the bells)
Sugar (And I reminisce)
Don't you miss me? Don't you miss me?
Come back, baby (I hear those Christmas bells
But I never knew that I could miss you like this)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(I listen to the bells
And they make me remember)
Merry Christmas, Darlene
...
You too, Luther
(When we were so in love
It was only last year, this time in December)
Come on back, Darlene
...
I'm here
(I listen to the bells
And I reminisce)
It's Christmas time
...
I know you remember
...
I sure do
(I hear those Christmas bells
But I never knew that I could miss you like this)
Nothing but wonderful memories
...
Still got the feeling
...
Yeah
Yeah
(I listen to the bells
And they make me remember)
You remember
...
I sure do
(When we were so in love
It was only last year, this time in December
I listen to the bells
And I reminisce
I hear those Christmas bells
But I never knew that I could miss you like this)
