You've been calling on me every day
Ever since my Bobby went away
You've been knocking on my front door
And I know just what you're looking for, but
Even though you really look so fine
And we've been having good times

I'm gonna wait, 'till my Bobby gets home
Wait 'till my baby gets home
Yeah, yeah, yeah you better leave me alone
True I need some lovin' and some kissin' and a huggin'
But I'll wait 'till my Bobby gets home

You wanna take me to a movie show
I gotta tell you that I just can't go
I know Bobby's gonna call tonight
I wanna tell him evey thing's allright, and
Though I haven't got a thing to do
And I'm so lonely and blue
