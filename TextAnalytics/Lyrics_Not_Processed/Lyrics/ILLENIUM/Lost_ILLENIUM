[Verse 1]
It's back to the basics without you now
I'm trying not to fall under
You told me I should take a look around
Lost it all, and it's no wonder how it came to be
I'm stepping out the door of you and me
I'm crossing out the eyes and what they've seen
I'm better off, I'm better off, I'm better

[Chorus]
It's time for me to breathe
Iâ€™m gasping for the air, you stole from me
I'm crossing out the eyes and what they've seen
I'm better off, I'm better off, I'm better lost

[Post-Chorus]
I'm better lost
I'm better lost
I'm better lost
I'm better lost

[Verse 2]
Been down on defeat
Rose from beneath
To find my escape
I'll run from the lies you tried to hide
I'll vanish without a trace

[Chorus]
It's time for me to breathe
I'm gasping for the air you stole from me
I'm crossing out the eyes and what they've seen
I'm better off, I'm better off, I'm better lost

[Breakdown]
Now I'm without you, without you now
Now I'm without you, without you now (I'm better lost)
Now I'm without you, without you now (I'll never need you to see through)
Now I'm without you, without you now (Yeah I'm better lost)
Now I'm without you, without you now
Now I'm without you, without you now (I'm better lost)
Now I'm without you, without you now (I'll never need you to see through)
I'm better lost

[Outro]
Now I'm without you, without you now
Now I'm without you, without you now (I'm better off)
Now I'm without you, without you now
Now I'm without you, without you now (I'm better lost)
Now I'm without you, without you now
Now I'm without you, without you now (I'm better lost)
Now I'm without you, without you now (I'll never need you)
Now I'm without you, without you now (I'm better lost)
