[Verse 1]
At first I didn’t think that I was cut enough to bleed
Then I saw my secrets getting swallowed by the sea
Through a telescope
I saw a diamond glow

[Pre-Chorus]
How you brought me home
I guess I’ll never know

[Chorus]
With God as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it’s gold
And it’s all on you
With God as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it’s gold
And it’s all on you

[Bridge]
I get my kicks from you
I get my kicks from you

[Verse 2]
Can’t see, dark road, driving up the hills
Looking at the girl, hand barely on the wheel
Got no where to go
We can take it slow

[Pre-Chorus]
How you brought me home
I guess I’ll never know

[Bridge]
I get my kicks from you
I get my kicks from you

[Chorus]
With God as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it’s gold
And it’s all on you

[Post-Chorus]
And it’s all on you
And it’s all on you
And it’s all on you

[Outro]
Kicks from you
I get my kicks from you
