[Intro]
Hey, how are you doing?
I just w
anted to say that I m
iss you, I guess
And I'm sorry
Call me back
Bye

[Verse 1: EDEN]
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel now
60 over the limit just 'cause I can
They say, "You know, you gotta slow down
There's no coming back"
So young and restless, I'm a clich√©, yeah
But it's easier said than done

[Pre-Chorus: EDEN]
And I can't keep waiting here
I'm just aging
So I'm gone
Such a shame, and

[Chorus: EDEN]
Baby, I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in saying "I'm never coming home"
But I'm drawing the line
And say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known

[Verse 2: EDEN]
So falling in and falling out fast
I'm burning up, I can't believe this got old so fast
And I'm done with feeling like I'm told I should
'Cause it's a feeling I'm chasing
And I ain't found it here in a while

[Pre-Chorus: EDEN]
But I can't keep waiting here
I'm just aging
So I'm gone
Such a shame, and

[Chorus: EDEN]
Baby, I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in saying "I'm never coming home"
But I'm drawing the line
And say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known

[Outro: EDEN]
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
