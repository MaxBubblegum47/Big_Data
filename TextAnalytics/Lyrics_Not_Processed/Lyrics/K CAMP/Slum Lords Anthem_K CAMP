Slum won’t call the crew
Cause slow it up on the slum
You say I’m slumming the building?
So I’m gonna creep right into
Will you gonna feel me?

[Verse 1]
What’s up mambo rambo?
Where that bih with all that ammo?
Ride me like a camel

Lay her flat just like some sandals
Flip her like a channel
Then pass her off straight to Lambo
All my niggas slum,all my niggas slum
Unwrap her like a gift I'm like rampapapam

So girl ,don’t you dare play dumb
Yell out hundred rounds
You know them slum's gonna come
