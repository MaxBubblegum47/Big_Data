Aphrodisia, Darling let me take you there
Aphrodisia. Aphrodisia, Darling, let me take you there
Aphrodisia

I never thought I'd ever get you here
So, Baby, let's love before the moment disappears
The fire's burnin', it's time for learning what turns us on
When we're in motion, we'll keep going until the dawn
Oh Girl understand I just want to be the man to give you what you need
Just come along with me

Aphrodisia Darling let me take you there
Aphrodisia. Aphrodisia, Darling, let me take you there
Aphrodisia

No stalling No more small talking
Girl, I want you to know I got plans for you body, Baby
Kiss you here and lick you there
What's your pleasure, I don't care

Girl, I'm so excited
And only you can take me higher
Aww, come on and ride it I can't wait to get inside ya
Eww, come here, Suga Let me taste your body now
I'm hungry for your loving just let me show you how

Aphrodisia Darling let me take you there
Aphrodisia. Aphrodisia, Darling, let me take you there
Aphrodisia

I've been opn your case for days
Girl, since I laid eyes on you I could see it in your face
You got those "lack of lovin' blues"
You don't have to weep no longer "Cause the Love Doctor" is here
I got stuff to make ya holler let me be your souvenir

C'mon let me taste you, girl Let me get inside your world
I wanna take your mind somewhere, you best just be prepared
I can't wait ta' stimulate cha'
Let me ease your tension inside places I won't mention

Aphrodisia Darling let me take you there
Aphrodisia. Aphrodisia, Darling, let me take you there
Aphrodisia
