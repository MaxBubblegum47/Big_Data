I've told ya I love ya, now get out!
I've told ya I love ya, now get out!
Everything's rosy and everything's Jake
But just how much can a good girl take?
I told ya I love ya, now get out!

There may be times I need ya, there's no doubt;
Baby, now you're somethin' I can do without!
Leave your number and go on home
The doorway was there, which is by the phone!
I've told ya I love ya, now get out!

Baby, please leave me be
You want a puppet and there's no strings on me!
Get hep, you can leave on the five eighteen
Now don't go 'way sayin' I've been mean;
Like any gal I can change my ways
A round trip ticket good for sixty days!
I've told ya I love ya, now get out!

Baby, please leave me be
You want a puppet and there's no strings on me!
Get hep, you can leave on the five eighteen
Now don't go 'way sayin' I've been mean;
Like any gal I can change my ways
A round trip ticket good for sixty days!
I've told ya I love ya, now get out!
Man, get lost, for now!
