[Verse 1]
Well I'mma write a little letter
I'm gonna mail it to my local DJ
Yeah it's a jumping little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today

[Verse 2]
You know my temperature's rising
The jukebox blowing a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keep a-singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
Tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 3]
I got the rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I caught the rolling arthritis
Sitting down at a rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
They rocking in two by two

[Bridge]
Well, if you feel and like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over then move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock with
One another
Roll over Beethoven
Dig these rhythm and blues

[Verse 4]
Well, early in the morning I'm giving you my warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle, I'ma play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 5]
You know she wiggle like a glow worm
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner
You oughta see him reel and rock
Long as she got a dime, the music won't never stop

[Outro]
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues
