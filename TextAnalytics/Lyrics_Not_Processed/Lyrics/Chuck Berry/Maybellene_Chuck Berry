[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started doing the things you used to do

[Verse 1]
As I was motorvatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coupe DeVille
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five
She's bumper to bumper rollin' side by side

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do

[Verse 2]
A Cadillac pulled up to one hundred and four
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It done got a cloud and started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passin' lane
The rain water blowin' all under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor good

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do

[Chorus]
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do

[Verse 3]
The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do
