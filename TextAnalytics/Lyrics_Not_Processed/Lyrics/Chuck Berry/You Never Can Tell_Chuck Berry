[Verse 1]
It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that 
Pierre
 did truly love the 
mademoiselle
And now the young 
monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell

[Hook]
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Verse 2]
They furnished off an apartment with
A two room 
Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well

[Hook]
"C'est la vie"
, say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Verse 3]
They had a hi-fi phono, boy
Did they let it blast
Seven hundred 
little records
All 
rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell

[Hook]
"
C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Verse 4]
They bought a souped-up jitney, was a cherry red '53
And drove it down Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre was wedded to the lovely madamoiselle

[Hook]
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Refrain]
They had a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell

[Hook]
"C'est la vie", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
