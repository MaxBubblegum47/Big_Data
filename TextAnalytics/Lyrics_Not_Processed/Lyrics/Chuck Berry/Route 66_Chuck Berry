[Verse 1]
Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way, that's the highway that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well it winds from Chicago to L.A
More than 2000 miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

[Pre-Chorus]
Well it goes from St Louis, Joplin, Missouri
Oklahoma City looks ooh, so pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona don't forget Winona
Kingsman, Barstaw, San Bernadino

[Chorus]
Would you get hip to this kindly tip?
Just take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Well it goes from St Louis, Joplin, Missouri
Oklahoma City looks ooh, so pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona don't forget Winona
Kingsman, Barstaw, San Bernadino

[Chorus]
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 66
