[THE CARDS]
Bum bum bum bum
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red
We dare not stop or waste a drop
So let the paint be spread!
We're painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red!

Oh, painting the roses red
And many a tear we shed

[THREE OF CLUBS]
Because we know

[TWO & THREE OF CLUBS]
They'll cease to grow

[ACE OF CLUBS]
In fact they'll soon be dead!

[THE CARDS]
And yet we go ahead
Painting the roses red!
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red!

[ALICE]
Oh, pardon me
But Mister Three
Why must you paint them red?

[THREE OF CLUBS, spoken]
Well the fact is, Miss, we planted the white roses by mistake!
And -

[THE CARDS]
The queen
She likes them red
If she saw white instead
She'd raise her voice
And each of us would quickly lose his head!
Since this is the thought we dread
We're painting the roses red!

[ALICE, spoken]
Oh, dear, then let me help you!

(Sung)
Painting the roses red...

[ALL]
We're painting the roses red!
Don't tell the queen that's what you've seen
Or tell her what we've said!
We're painting the roses red

[ALICE]
Yes, painting the roses red!

[ACE]
Not pink -
[THREE OF CLUBS]
Not green -

[ALICE]
Not aquamarine!

[ALL]
We're painting the roses red!
