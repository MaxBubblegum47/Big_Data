UNHUMAN RACE
Oh I wouldn’t step here
And I wouldn’t step there
I would only step ‘round with the greatest of care
And it’s hopeless to try to escape through the air
It’s high-flyin’ spooks, we are every-which-where
Well, look after your back
We look into your face
It’s a gruesome member of the un-human race
We’re a grizzly, gruzzly, gamply disgrace
Yes it’s quite like those spooks
We’re all over the place
THE GRINCH
{spoken} Enjoying yourself?  Take a spook’s tour!
