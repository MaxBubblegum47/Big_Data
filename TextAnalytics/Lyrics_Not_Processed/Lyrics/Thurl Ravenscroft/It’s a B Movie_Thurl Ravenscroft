[Intro]
Watch yourself
Don't fall off of the shelf
You must be the new boys in town
What's that sound?
Is someone movin' round?
Sit down for a spell
You don't look so well

[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, I feel great
You just leave yourself to fate
You might as well just hang around
It's too late
We've got to operate
Just try to relax
It's a house of wax!
Oh, I remember 
Frankenstein
Shivers up my spine, wo-oh
I'm for getting out of here
No need to shout, my dear, no-oh
Who will go to the cellar down below?
Trouble is a-bubblin' in the brew
And while you're down there 
Mr. Vincent Price
Will give you good advice
He'll know what to do
You just tell him "Boo!"
He will put the voodoo in the stew
I'm telling you!

[Chorus]
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show

[Verse 2]
Look at me, I mean really! Barf! Barf! Barf! I'm a can-opener, a lamp, and a shaver. Oh, God! I'm a mishmash!
This is weird
It's much worse than I feared
I'll close my eyes and make it disappear
This is strange
It ain't 
home on the range
You just tell 
St. Pete
That you got cold feet
There goes the sun
Here comes the night
Somebody turn on the light
Somebody tell me that fate has been kind
You can't go out
You are out of your mind!

[Chorus]
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
