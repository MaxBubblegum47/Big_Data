[Chorus]
When you say that
Is that how you really feel?
When I do that
Is that all you really need?
When I say that
Will you come home?
When I do that
Will you come home?

[Post-Chorus]
Will you come, will you come
Will you come, will you come home?

[Chorus]
When you say that
Is that how you really feel?
When I do that
Is that all you really need?
When I say that
Will you come home?
When I do that
Will you come home?

[Post-Chorus]
Will you come, will you come
Will you come, will you come home?

[Chorus]
Are you sleeping?
Is that how you really feel?
When I do that
Is that all you really need?
When I say that
Will you come home?
When I do that
Will you come home?
