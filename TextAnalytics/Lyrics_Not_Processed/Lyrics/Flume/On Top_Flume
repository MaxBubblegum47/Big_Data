[Refrain: Shirt]
All that I want in this life is the chance to do my thing
All that I want in this life is the chance to do my thing
Yeah

[Chorus: Shirt]
I want the top
All my people right there in the back of the spot
I need the top
If you know me, you don't know me to stop
I need the top
All my people there in back of the spot
Let off a shot
Yeah

[Verse 1: Shirt]
And you don't just wake up rich one day
This kind of life never just slip your way
I gave up taking carefree trips to the Bay
Cali'-bound is 'cause I got a flip in L.A
Paris-bound 'cause a new video's on the way
No breaks for me, no vacay for me
I advance every minute, boy, I live it
Why start shit you don't finish?

[Chorus: Shirt]
I want the top
All my people right there in the back of the spot
I need the top
If you know me, you don't know me to stop
I need the top
All my people there in back of the spot
Let off a shot
Yeah

[Verse 2: Shirt]
Drinks on chill, got drinks on chill
Lights get dim and I think I will
I work so hard that I think I will
You had a long week, bitch, how you think I feel?
History favors the bold, dog
Roll something, make sure my story gets told
Make sure our story gets told
The night's forever young, it's us that gets old

[Refrain: Shirt]
All that I want in this life is the chance to do my thing
Yeah

[Chorus: Shirt]
I want the top
All my people right there in the back of the spot
I need the top
If you know me, you don't know me to stop
I need the top
All my people there in back of the spot
Let off a shot
Yeah
I want the top, top, top, top, top
All my people right there in the back of the spot
I need the top, top, top, top, top
If you know me, you don't know me to stop
I need the top, top, top, top, top
All my people there in the back of the spot
Let off a shot
Yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Shirt]
Yeah
I want the top, top, top, top, top
All my people right there in the back of the spot
I need the top, top, top, top, top
If you know me, you don't know me to stop
I need the top, top, top, top, top
All my people there in the back of the spot
Let off a shot
Yeah
I want the top, top, top, top, top
All my people right there in the back of the spot
I need the top, top, top, top, top
If you know me, you don't know me to stop
I need the top, top, top, top, top
All my people there in the back of the spot
Let off a shot
Yeah

[Outro: Shirt]
Yeah
I'm saying, what you got for me, world?
Yeah
What you got, got, got, got?
