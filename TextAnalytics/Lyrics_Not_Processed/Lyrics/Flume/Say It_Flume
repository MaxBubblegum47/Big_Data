[Verse 1: Tove Lo]
Feelin' the song, party done, shadows walkin' home
Walkin' with our game on
You are my kind, classic mind, and you look so fine
Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm
Lovin' the cold, smoke a roll, see your fingers shake
I'm gettin' through your heart break
Some kinda freak, sing for me, don't know what I need
Mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Don't doubt me, babe
You make me wanna change
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...
Bite me, babe
You make me love the pain
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got me fallin' right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm)
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me fuck you right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm)

[Verse 2: Tove Lo]
I'm gettin' the door, silent walk, who's the first to speak?
Speak it like a real freak
Voice in my head, in my bed, filled with you instead
Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm
Takin' your time, work my mind, and I play with you
I play pretend it's so true
Follow me down, listen 'round to the deep dark sound
Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Don't doubt me, babe
You make me wanna change
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...
Bite me, babe
You make me love the pain
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got me fallin' right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm)
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me fuck you right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm)

[Bridge: Instrumental]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Don't doubt me, babe
You make me wanna change
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...
Bite me, babe
You make me love the pain
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got me falling right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm)
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me fuck you right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm)
