[Verse 1: Vera Blue]
I always let the days slip away
I should have been making up my mind
I never opened up, took it all in
And now I’m running out of time
Sometimes I dream about going back
Keeping all the things I left behind
But now I know you can’t change the past
Way too young to know the reason why

[Chorus: Vera Blue]
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back

[Verse 2: Vera Blue]
I feel the gravity pulling me
Faster than it ever has before
When I was seventeen, nicotine loving
Had me rush out of the door
I try to hold it back, take a breath
Looking at old pictures on the floor
But I hear everything telling me
"You don’t have the time, you gotta go"

[Chorus: Vera Blue]
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back

[Bridge: Vera Blue]
All the years, all the issues
All the eyes I have looked into
The stages and the love
All comes rushing back at once

[Verse 3: Vera Blue]
I always let the days slip away
I should have been making up my mind
I never opened up, took it all in
And now I’m running out of time
Sometimes I dream about going back
Keeping all the things I left behind
But now I know you can’t change the past
Way too young to know the reason why

[Chorus: Vera Blue]
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back

[Outro: Vera Blue]
I always
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
I always
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
