[Intro: Chet Faker]
It's just a sound beating of my lobes
It's just a sound beating of my lobes
It's just a sound beating of my lobes
It's just a sound beating of my lobes
It's just a sound beating of my lobes
It's just a sound beating of my lobes

[Verse 1: Chet Faker]
Goin' down but not for long
Got no love to be someone
Goin' down, but thatâ€™s alright
All I want is to be left alone
Left alone, left alone, left alone
Left alone, left alone, left alone
Left alone, left alone, left alone
Left alone

[Verse 2: Chet Faker]
Cannot swallow blue found proud
More than that, my sleep is wild
All I need is softened bones
Breathe in sorrow
Gonna watch you fake it now
Will I freak, can I calm down?
And I take it all at a loss
Breathe in sorrow
Gonna watch you fake it now
Will I freak, can I come down?
And I take it all at a loss
Breathe out sorrow

[Verse 3: Chet Faker]
Gonna find them peaks and lows
Holding by the knees and vow
I can't always feel this proud
Breathe out sorrow
Oh, I tell you something more
What my brain is bleeding for
And it hurts, my darling
But breathe out sorrow
Gonna find them peaks and lows
Holding by the knees and vow
I can't always feel this proud
Breathe out sorrow
Oh, I tell you something more
What my brain is bleeding for
And it hurts, my darling
But I breathe out sorrow
