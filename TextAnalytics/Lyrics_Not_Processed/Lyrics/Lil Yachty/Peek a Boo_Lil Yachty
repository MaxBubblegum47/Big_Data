[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Red dot, red dot, red dot, red dot, red dot
On his nose like Rudolph
Pull up to the scene, all white with the roof off
Take that lil' bitch to the Ruth's Chris
Fuck her, then fuck on her sister, I'm ruthless
Chill on the 6 when I'm fuckin' on pucchi
That bitch was ugly, but pussy on smoothie (wet)
Play with that kitty like hello
Take a step back then I bust it, I bust it, I bust it like Melo
Aimin' at you and your fellows
My new bitch yellow
She blow that dick like a cello
Fuck her then send that bitch home on the metro
Ooh, young nigga fly like a pigeon
Vercetti frames, they be hidin' my vision
Make sure all my niggas eat, that's the mission
No more wishin', I'ma go get it, go get it, I got it

[Verse 2: Offset]
Open your eyes, bitch you see all this money
Made that lil' bitch tape a brick to her stomach
You not the gang, we don't kick it or punt it
Just bought the Wraith and I wrapped it, titanic
Look at the numbers, mechanics ain't frontin'
I came from the lick, went to jail, I got punished, ooh
Pullin' up foreign, Freddy Kreuger, wow
My niggas turn barracuda
You cappin', I came from trappin'
I used to have the dope stashed in the cabinet (dope!)
Mama couldn't tell me shit, where was my daddy? (Mom)
Look at my Patek, I'm flexin', I'm petty (I'm petty)
I fucked the pussy the first time I met it
Won't give you no credit, you Eddie spaghetti
I cook the brick, cut the brick with machetes
Married the money, the bitch wasn't ready, uh, uh

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Uh, uh, play with that pussy like peek-a-boo, uh
Play with that pussy like peek-a-boo, uh
Play with that pussy like peek-a-boo, uh

Left wrist white, it's the Patek (Philippe)
Bad white bitch with a fatty (unique)
Smokin' on cookies from granny (trees)
Pocket rocket, go go gadget (go go)
I make a play, Madden (John)
I know it was some speculation 'bout who the one
But we invented the dabbin' (dab)
Fuck it, we just let 'em have it (have it)
Draco for niggas with static (brrt, static)
I can do magic and make me a rabbit
With usin' my karats (ice, woah)
Gelato package, I'm drinkin' on Actavis, expensive habits (Actavis, mud)
Yellow bitch, Pikachu (bitch)
Cameltoe peekin' at you (look at you)
Peek-a-boo
Peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo
