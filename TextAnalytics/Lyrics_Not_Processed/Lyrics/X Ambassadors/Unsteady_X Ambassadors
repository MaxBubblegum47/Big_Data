[Intro]
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

[Verse 1]
Mama
, come here
Approach, appear
And Daddy, I'm alone
'Cause this house don't feel like home

[Pre-Chorus]
If you love me, don't let go (hold), woah
If you love me, don't let go (hold)

[Chorus]
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

[Verse 2]
Mother, I know
That you're tired of being alone
Dad, I know you're trying
To fight when you feel like flying

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you love me, don't let go (hold), woah
If you love me, don't let go (hold)

[Chorus]
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

[Outro]
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
