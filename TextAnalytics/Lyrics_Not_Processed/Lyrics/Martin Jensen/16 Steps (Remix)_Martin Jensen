[Intro]
(16 steps from the uh to the)
(Oh, from the uh to the)

[Chorus: Olivia Holt]
It's only 16 steps from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body next to mine
Can’t help myself, help myself (only 16 steps)
It's only 16 steps from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body next to mine
Can't help myself, help myself (only 16 steps)

[Verse 1: Yxng Bane]
I can’t help myself, I can't help you
You say everything but the truth
You never swallow pride
All chewing off your lies
Knowing that you still the same
I should've always knew
Run along, 'cause you're full of boo
And I ain't tryna fight you when I see red too
16 steps backwards and forwards
You can't push a man away
Then tell me to pull through

[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Holt & Yxng Bane]
A mess with it, a mess without it
I go down either way
Endless shots and countless hours
I wonder 'bout your place

[Chorus: Olivia Holt]
It’s only 16 steps from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body next to mine
Can’t help myself, help myself (only 16 steps)
It's only 16 steps from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body next to mine
Can’t help myself, help myself (only 16 steps)

[Verse 2: Olivia Holt]
Take me in slowly, hold me down and
Swallow your prayers, just spit me out
I wanna believe something that's
Different from what I've been told (different from what I've been told)
Take all my doubts so I can really
Be with you now and let my body
Really believe in something that’s
Different than letting you go (letting you go)

[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Holt]
A mess with it, a mess without it
I go down either way
Endless shots and countless hours
I wonder 'bout your place

[Chorus: Olivia Holt & Yxng Bane ]
It's only 16 steps from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body next to mine
Can't help myself, help myself (only 16 steps)
It's only 16 steps from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body next to mine
Can't help myself, help myself (only 16 steps)

[Bridge: Olivia Holt]
Only 16 steps
Only 16 steps
Only 16 steps
Only 16 steps

[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Holt]
A mess with it, a mess without it
I go down either way
Endless shots and countless hours
I wonder 'bout your place

[Chorus: Olivia Holt]
It's only 16 steps from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body next to mine
Can't help myself, help myself (only 16 steps)
It's only 16 steps from your door to your bed
I should know better with your body next to mine
Can't help myself, help myself (only 16 steps)

[Outro: Olivia Holt]
Only 16 steps
Only 16 steps
Only 16 steps
Only 16 steps
