[Verse 1]
Miracles, I see miracles
There's a fire burning deep within your eyes
Searching for something beautiful
Now, I see that you're my angel in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
You
Yeah, I've been waiting here for you to take me higher, higher
You
Yeah, I've been waiting here for you to take me higher, higher

[Chorus]
Whenever the lights are burning low
Whenever the nights are turning cold
You are the one who takes me home (Ooh)
Feel like you brought me back to life
And know that my heart will be alright
When I breathe your love, I breathe your love
(Yeah) When I breathe your love
When I breathe your love

[Post-Chorus]
When I breathe your love

[Verse 2]
Oh, magical, it's so magical
I see it written in the stars upon the sky
Powerful, feel so powerful
When we touch I get this feeling deep inside

[Pre-Chorus]
You
Yeah, I've been waiting here for you to take me higher, higher
You
Yeah, I've been waiting here for you to take me higher

[Chorus]
Whenever the lights are burning low
Whenever the nights are turning cold
You are the one who takes me home (Ooh)
Feel like you brought me back to life
And know that my heart will be alright
When I breathe your love, I breathe your love
(Yeah) When I breathe your love
When I breathe your love

[Post-Chorus]
When I breathe your love
When I breathe your love
I breathe your love, I breathe your love
