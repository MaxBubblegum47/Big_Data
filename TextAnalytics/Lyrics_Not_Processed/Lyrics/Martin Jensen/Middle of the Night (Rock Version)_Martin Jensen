[Verse 1: Connor Ball]
I keep coming back to that moment
Where it all fell apart
So I try and drink my emotions
'Til I can't feel my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Connor Ball]
And I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I do all I can
To get you out of my head

[Chorus: Connor Ball]
So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

[Post-Chorus: Connor Ball]
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night

[Verse 2: Sainte]
I've got no good explanation
For what I put you through
Managing my expectations
Is what I never do

[Pre-Chorus: Connor Ball and Sainte (Both)]
Yeah and I don't understand
How you slipped through my hands
And I'm trying all I can
(To forget you again)

[Chorus: Connor Ball and Sainte]
So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night

[Bridge: Connor Ball]
So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you

[Chorus: Connor Ball and Sainte]
So when I call you in the middle of the night
And I'm choking on the words 'cause I miss you
Baby, don't tell me I'm out of time
I got so much of my loving to give you
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I need you
