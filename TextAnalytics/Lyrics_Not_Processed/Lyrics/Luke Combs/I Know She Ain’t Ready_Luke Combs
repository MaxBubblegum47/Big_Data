[Verse 1]
You were wearing that black dress
Coat, and cowboy boots
He was there, but I didn't care
I was too busy staring at you
In the pouring rain, with the blue lights flashin'
In the hills of Appalachian
Close to tears with your makeup smeared
I asked you what had happened

[Chorus]
But I know she ain't ready
She won't be for awhile
And he broke her down
And when I'm around
I can see it in her smile
She's fightin' getting closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready
But that's alright with me

[Verse 2]
You were wearing that red dress
Pearls, and those high heels
Liked the way it made you look
You love the way it made you feel
So I said to you
"I'd sure love to do this again"
And you said
"Me too, but I'm just not over him"

[Chorus]
And I know she ain't ready
She won't be for awhile
And he broke her down
And when I'm around
I can see it in her smile
She's fightin' getting closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready
But that's alright with me, yeah

[Bridge]
She started calling me baby, and two years later
I was down on one knee
With a ring in hand, I said
"I'm your man, and girl, will you marry me?"

[Chorus 2]
She said, "You know that I'm ready
And I have been for awhile
When the bells sound and you turn around
I'll be walking down the aisle
This will only bring us closer
It's just too plain to see
And I know that we're ready
So that's alright with me
That's alright with me"
