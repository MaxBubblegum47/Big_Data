[Verse 1]
Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it

[Pre-Chorus]
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Verse 2]
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing along

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Chorus]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

[Outro]
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
