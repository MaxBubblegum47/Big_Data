If the sun should tumble from the skies
If the sea should suddenly run dry
If you love me really love me
Let it happen, I won't care
If it seems that everything is lost
I will smile and never count the cost
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen
Darling I won't care

Shall I catch a shooting star?
Shall I bring it where you are?
If you want me to I will
You can let me any test
I'll do anything you ask
If youâ€™d only say you love me still
When at last our life on earth is through
I will share eternity with you
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen, I won't care
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen, I won't care
