Jingle bell, Jingle bell, Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and Jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the Jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, Jingle bell, Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in Jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle bell square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time it's a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy up Jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a Jingle and beat
That's the Jingle bell rock

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away

Jingle bell time it's a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy up Jingle horse, pick up those feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a Jingle and beat
That's the Jingle bell
That's the Jingle bell
That's the Jingle bell rock
