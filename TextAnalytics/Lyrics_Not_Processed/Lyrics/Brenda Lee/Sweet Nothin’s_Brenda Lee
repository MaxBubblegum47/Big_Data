(Whispering) Uh huh honey
(Whispering) Alright
My baby whispers in my ear
Ummm, Sweet Nothin's
He knows the things I like to hear
Ummm, Sweet Nothin's
Things he wouldn't tell
Nobody else
Secret baby
I keep them to myself
Sweet Nothin's
Ummm, Sweet Nothin's
We walk along hand in hand
Ummm, Sweet Nothin's
Yeah, we both understand
Ummm Sweet Nothin's
Sittin' in the classroom trying to read my book
My baby give me that special look
Sweet Nothin's
Ummm, Sweet Nothin's
Ah, sittin' on my front porch
Ummm, Sweet Nothin's
Well, do I love you, of course
Ummm, Sweet Nothin's
Mama turned on the front porch light
Sayin' "Come here darlin' that's enough for tonight"
Sweet Nothin's
Ummm, Sweet Nothin's
Sweet Nothin's
