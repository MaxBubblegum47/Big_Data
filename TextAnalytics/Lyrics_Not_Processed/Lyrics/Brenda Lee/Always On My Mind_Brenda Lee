[Verse 1]
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I should have
Little things, I should have said and done
I just never took the time...

[Refrain]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Verse 2]
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that your mine
If I made you feel second best
Well I'm sorry I was blind

[Refrain]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Bridge]
Tell, tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give to me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied, satisfied

[Break]
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

[Refrain]
You were always on my mind, yeah...
You were always on my mind....
