[Verse 1]
Train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far away?
Now I feel the wind blow outside my door
Means I'm, I'm leaving my woman at home
Lord and

[Chorus]
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind again

[Verse 2]
And I don't know, oh where I'm going
I just want to be left alone
Well, when this train ends I'll try again
I'm leaving my woman at home
Lord and

[Chorus]
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on, Tuesday's gone

[Piano and Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
Train roll on many miles from my home
See I'm, I'm riding my blues away, yeah
Tuesday, you see, she had to be free, lawd but
Somehow I've got to carry on
Lord and

[Chorus]
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind, whoa
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on

[Outro]
Roll on
'Cause my baby's gone
I'm riding my blues, babe
Tryin' to ride my blues
Ride on train, ride on train
Ride my blues babe
Goodbye to you, babe
Goodbye to you yeah
Oh train
