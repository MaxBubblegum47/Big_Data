[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you holding me tight, I feel alive

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
Blue

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Each day I feel so blessed to be looking at you
'Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive
Now let's live it up

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
Blue
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
Blue

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You’ve got to hold on, you’ve got a hold on me
We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You’ve got to hold on, you’ve got a hold on me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
Blue

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You’ve got to hold on, you’ve got a hold on me
We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You’ve got to hold on, you’ve got a hold on me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
Blue

[Outro: Beyoncé & Blue Ivy]
Hold on to me, hold on
Bee-sy-ay

Mommy, mommy, mommy

Can we see daddy?
Missus Carter!
Missus Carter!
