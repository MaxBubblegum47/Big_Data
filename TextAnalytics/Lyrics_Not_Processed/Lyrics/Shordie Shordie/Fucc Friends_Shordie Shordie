[Intro]
Oh, fucc friends, fucc friends
Oh, fucc friends

[Verse 1]
Fuck you and everybody that you came with
Speak gas, feel like nobody speak my language
First class, they on a flight out to Japan
Oh, we got more problems than all of you
Look good, in case nobody ever told you
I hope you fall in love, I’m tryna hold you
All ass, hit from the back I’m tryna fold you
So come here a second, I don’t like to text

[Chorus]
Fucc friends, we more close than that
In your feelings, why you postin’ that?
Fucc friends, I want you close to me
Even though you never notice me
Fucc friends, what you thinkin' 'bout?
Eatin’ dinner at yo’ momma house
Fucc friends, woah, fucc friends

[Verse 2]
Don’t think you should go and chill with anybody
All night, we been up late, you like the Molly
Me and you, it’s only us, you like it private
Oh what don’t you like in me? Why can’t we get along?
Ain't movin’ fast, just bein’ friends
In the park, we take a walk, jus’ holdin’ hands
In the mall, get what you want, I’m droppin’ bands
So tell me you swear, I never care

[Chorus]
Fucc friends, we more close than that
In your feelings, why you postin’ that?
Fucc friends, I want you close to me
Even though you never notice me
Fucc friends, what you thinkin' 'bout?
Eatin’ dinner at yo’ momma house
Fucc friends, woah fucc friends

Fucc friends, we more close than that
In your feelings, why you postin’ that?
Fucc friends, I want you close to me
Even though you never notice me
Fucc friends, what you thinkin' 'bout?
Eatin’ dinner at yo’ momma house
Fucc friends, woah fucc friends
