[Intro]
Woah, aye aye aye ayeeeayeeayee
Hey hmm hmm hm

[Verse 1]
Told me stories bout your lifestyle
And all the shit you couldn't manage
Told me you ain't like them other niggas
And that, all them other niggas average
Leaving but you wit them other niggas
You must think a nigga dumb
You tried to set me up and get the drum
How you gon leave a nigga for a bum
Needs exposin'
You just a hoe n
But that shit ain't near me
Mind' is focused
Motorolling'
We back from the gimmic
Got me another
And she bad, and she mine
Called your phone Would call again
But never mind

[Chorus]
Man
I called, you ain't answer
Like maybe there is someone else
And you leave with no question
Like I ain't had someone else
But I had another one
And she bad too
Getting the paper
Like she had to
And I don't want you, Cuz 
you basic
And you know I got time
I can waste it

[Verse 2]
Make money
Chill wit the crew, I really don't know what we can do
Take money
We used to rob, you move you know we gon shoot
But please though make money dough
Cuz you wit a hunnid hoess
And Me with just my-self and I
Aye
Solo, it's just me myself and I, again
Did that, I congratulate you try again
Wanna come home to you and me
Even though there's no you and me
So how the fuck you think I feel?

[Chorus]
I called, you ain't answer
Like maybe there is someone else
And you leave wit no question
Like I ain't had someone else
But I had another one
And she bad too
Getting the paper
Like she had to
And I don't want you, Cuz you basic
And you know I got time
I can waste it
