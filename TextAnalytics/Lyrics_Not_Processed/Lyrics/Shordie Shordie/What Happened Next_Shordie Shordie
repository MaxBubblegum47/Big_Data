[Intro]
And we know what happened next
Aye aye aye ayeayeayeaye
And we know what happened next
Aye aye aye ayeayeayeaye
And we know what happened next

[Verse 1]
Louie bitch from the hood, the valley
I be fuckin, then duckin her
How that's your girl and sadly
You was never even touching her
Let her in then she took everything
I was wrong for even trusting her
But she with you now
You was wrong for even cuffing her
Met a girl name Nina, she ain't like being seen, she was on me
Flew to LA, wasn't from LA, Arizona
Fore I went out there
I ran up on ’em, with no warning
And that's a fact, my nigga
I'm just laying back my nigga

[Chorus]
Used to get fly to much
Now i don't get fly enough
Popping percys and I’m smoking this weed
I dont think that I’m high enough
Got a lil’ bitch and she from the hills the valley
And she be rocking them badly
Told to come over, get off at 7
And we know what happened next
Used to get fly to much
Now i don't get fly enough
Popping percys and I’m smoking this weed
I dont think that I’m high enough
Got a lil’ bitch from the hills the valley
And she be rocking them badly
Told to come over, get off at 7
And we know what happened next

[Verse 2]
I had to beat it, she want me to eat it
Im sorta like Micheal Jackson in that pussy
Don't like them beef issues, we keep the misigens
We keep the Mac 11's fully loaded
Fuck it I’m tryna get money, teach ’em some
Fuck all that stay n leavin sum
Thought you really had to do it
I still want my credit, cuz they dont give me none
I just be serious, she just be curious
Like "Where you come up with your music?”
She got that wet wet, want that wet wet
It be hard to refuse it
Niggas keep hatin, keep on hatin
They just want me to looseee it
After, we hit the mall
Point, you can get it all

[Chorus]
Used to get fly to much
Now i don't get fly enough
Popping percys and I’m smoking this weed
I dont think that I’m high enough
Got a Louie bitch from the hills the valley
And she be rocking them badly
Told to come over, get off at 7
And we know what happened next
Used to get fly to much
Now i don't get fly enough
Popping percys and I’m smoking this weed
I dont think that I’m high enough
Got a lil’ bitch from the hills the valley
And she be rocking them badly
Told to come over, get off at 7
And we know what happened next
