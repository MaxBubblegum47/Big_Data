[Chorus]
'Cause I still ride wit it
Roll it up, get high wit it
On the stand, you lie wit it
.40 on me, outside wit it
'Cause I still got love for the streets
Cop a gun and glove for the beef
You be fuckin', ain't fuckin' on me
Out the window like, fuck the police

[Verse 1]
'Cause I still got love for a b
She don't ever got love for me back
Always got a treat, never trick
Like no ears in the hat
Used to bend that thing over, like no bones in her back
B.M. give that thing up, give good head, pull her track
Middle finger up, fuck them people
Never had a gun that was legal
You talkin' tough, but see you run to your people
You leaving it in the hands of your people
They claiming they don't really understand
Throw that pistol on your hand
Yeah, you say a lot, but you ain't really at the nigga
Take your word and off your mans

[Chorus]
'Cause I still ride wit it
Roll it up, get high wit it
On the stand, you lie wit it
.40 on me, outside wit it
'Cause I still got love for the streets
Cop a gun and glove for the beef
You be fuckin', ain't fuckin' on me
Out the window like, fuck the police
'Cause I still ride wit it
Roll it up, get high wit it
On the stand, you lie wit it
.40 on me, outside wit it
'Cause I still got love for the streets
Cop a gun and glove for the beef
You be fuckin', ain't fuckin' on me
Out the window like, fuck the police

[Verse 2]
I still have a thing for Savannah
She knew what we doing, the planner
You talk to me but I don't look at the camera
You talk to her but she don't ever got manners
She tell me she do what she like the most
I think what she like's to boast(?)
See me everywhere but when you turn around I'm disappearing on you kinda like a ghost
And I think all these bitches is trifling
Free my cousin, bidding with lifers
Fuck em, ?, hoping he come home, last time I seen him when they was in diapers
Doing the dash, if I crash, tell my son that I told him it's crazy, I did it for fun
Police behind me, but I'm on probation, if I get violated, I'll go on the run

[Chorus]
'Causes I still ride wit it
Roll it up, get high wit it
On the stand, you lie wit it
.40 on me, outside wit it
'Cause I still got love for the streets
Cop a gun and glove for the beef
You be fuckin', ain't fuckin' on me
Out the window like, fuck the police
'Cause I still ride wit it
Roll it up, get high wit it
On the stand, you lie wit it
.40 on me, outside wit it
'Cause I still got love for the streets
Cop a gun and glove for the beef
You be fuckin', ain't fuckin' on me
Out the window like, fuck the police
'Cause I still
