[Verse 1: Shordie Shordie]
I been chillin' like a villian in my space now
She see what I'm doin', now she in my face now
Be cool with the blicky in my lawyer case now
Like I got a ten piece, make that shit disappear
I got rid of you, now you reappear
Wanna be goals, wasn't never near
Seen a lot of things, wasn't never clear
And I

[Chorus: Shordie Shordie]
On the Westside
But I'm from the Eastside
Take a trip and we ride
Just pour the lean, might fall asleep
On the Westside
But I'm from the Eastside
Take a trip and we ride
Just pour the lean, might fall asleep

[Verse 2: Fenix Flexin]
I'm riding with it
You'd probably never know that
Woke up in the morning, tryna find out where the pour at
I be sipping codeine, I don't really fuck with cognac
I'm on that, these niggas steady beggin' for they ho back
Me and Shordie Shordie gettin' backends
I seen you at the club, ain't let you back in
When I fuck your bitch, I hit that ho with passion
I just popped a thirty and it's smackin'
I'm in Givenchy, shoot the clip until it's empty
Wockhardt, I dropped an eight into a Simply
Your bitch a Civic and my bitch look like a Bentley
Last time I walked in Gucci, dropped a twenty

[Chorus: Shordie Shordie]
On the Westside
But I'm from the Eastside
Take a trip and we ride
Just pour the lean, might fall asleep
On the Westside
But I'm from the Eastside
Take a trip and we ride
Just pour the lean, might fall asleep

[Verse 3: Ohgeesy]
Everything I do, I do nonchalant
I'm in Yves Saint Laurent, I can't help but to flaunt
I can't help but to flex
East to the West, nigga, where we goin' next?
Baby, I don't want no sex
Only want that top, bitch, you a bop
No, bitch, you a, bitch, you a, bitch, you a thot, ayy
You ain't nothin' but a ho bitch
Rich nigga, I be buyin' out the store, bitch
Look me in my face, lil' bitch, focus
When you suckin' on my dick and you throat this
Look me in my face, bitch, focus
When you suckin' on my dick and you throat this, ayy

[Chorus: Shordie Shordie]
On the Westside
But I'm from the Eastside
Take a trip and we ride
Just pour the lean, might fall asleep
On the Westside (Yeah, like Shoreline)
But I'm from the Eastside (Yeah, I'm thinkin' like where the beach at)
Take a trip and we ride (Yeah, cuz and them taught me about that)
Just pour the lean, might fall asleep (Yeah)
