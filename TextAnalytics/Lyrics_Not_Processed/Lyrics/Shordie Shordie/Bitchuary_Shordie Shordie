[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Know when I leave, you be goin', seein' different faces
But when I leave, I be fuckin' bitches, different places
Still in these streets, I got charges that a nigga facin'
So I don't got time for a nigga and his fuckin' drinkin'
Off of the weed, I'm talkin' cat piss
And he ain't no gangster, he just an actress
I be layin' it down, I'm talkin' mattress
And when you suckin' the D, I tell you catch this

[Chorus]
'Cause bitch, you a, bitch, you a
Bitch, you a, bitch, you a, bitch, you a, bitch, you a
Bitch, you a dog and your homegirl too, ayy
She hit me back like, "Your dawg is too," ayy
We can meet up, we can meet in groups, ayy
With you and I, it can be us two like
I'm in the club drinkin' Henny and a Black & Mild
Got my gun and I can wave it, I'ma start actin' wild
But I won't do that 'cause the gangster shit is out of style
And that's why I left the club early

[Verse 2]
Bitch, you a dog and your homegirl too
That's why I never got the chance to come and stay with you
I know you fuck with the whole damn crew
That's why I never got the chance to come and lay to you
Fuck then I leave 'cause I don't want you
That's why I never got the chance to come and stay with you
Make you my baby, make you my lady, take you away

[Chorus]
'Cause bitch, you a, bitch, you a
Bitch, you a, bitch, you a, bitch, you a, bitch, you a
Bitch, you a dog and your homegirl too, ayy
She hit me back like, "Your dawg is too," ayy
We can meet up, we can meet in groups, ayy
With you and I, it can be us two like
I'm in the club drinkin' Henny and a Black & Mild
Got my gun and I can wave it, I'ma start actin' wild
But I won't do that 'cause the gangster shit is out of style
And that's why I left the club early

[Outro]
'Cause bitch, you a, bitch, you a
Bitch, you a, bitch, you a, bitch, you a, bitch, you a
Bitch, you a dog and your homegirl too
She hit me back like, "Your dawg is too"
We can meet up, we can meet in groups
With you and I, it can be us two like
I'm in the club drinkin' Henny and a Black & Mild
Got my gun and I can wave it, I'ma start actin' wild
But I won't do that 'cause the gangster shit is out of style
And that's why I left the club early
