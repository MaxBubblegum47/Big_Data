[Verse 1]
Hallelujah, I'm a freak, I'm a freak, hallelujah
Every day of the week, I'ma do ya like I want to
I'm a Nile crocodile, a piranha

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, she got the power
Oh, look at her, she got the power
So, so, so

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter

[Post-Chorus]
So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh

[Verse 2]
Hallelujah, I'm a witch, I'm a witch, hallelujah
Swish swish, I'm a three-point shooter, I blow through ya
Like a hot wind out in the bayou, yah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, she got the power
Well, look at her, she got the power

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter

[Post-Chorus]
So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh

[Bridge]
My mama always told me that I'd make it
That I'd make it, so I made it
I put my back into and my heart in it
So I did it, yeah, I did it
My mama always told me that I'd make it
That I'd make it, so I made it
I put my back into and my heart in it
So I did it, yeah, I did it

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter

[Outro]
Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Swish swish, motherfucka (Ow)
