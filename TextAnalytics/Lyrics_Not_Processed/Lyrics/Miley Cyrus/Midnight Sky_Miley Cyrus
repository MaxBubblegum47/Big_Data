[Intro]
La, la, la-la, la

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own (Uh)
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes (Your ropes)
Forever and ever, no more (No more)

[Pre-Chorus]
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (Yeah, yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (Loved by you)

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la-la, la

[Verse 2]
She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's drippin' off of her face (Her face)
Said, "It ain't so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes"
You should know right now that I never stay put in one place
Forever and ever, no more (No more)

[Pre-Chorus]
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (Yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)

[Bridge]
Oh
I don't hide blurry eyes like you
Like you

[Chorus]
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, you know
I don't need to be loved by you
See his hands 'round my waist, thought you'd never be replaced, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (Yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (Yeah)

[Outro]
La, la, la-la, la
La, la
You know it's true, you know it's true
Loved by you
