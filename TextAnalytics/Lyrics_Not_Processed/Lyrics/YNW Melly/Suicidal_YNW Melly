[Intro]
Suicidal
Your love is suicidal
Lately I've been feeling suicidal
Your love is suicidal

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that we were meant to be
You took my heart and made it bleed
I gave you all my ecstasy
I know you'll be the death of me (
Keep it Z3N
)
Left lipstick on my Hennessy
Felt like you took my soul from me
You gave me all your ecstasy
I thought that we were meant to be

[Chorus]
Your love is suicidal
For me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal

[Refrain]
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh

[Verse]
I don't want to lose my conscience
Drinkin' all this Hennessy
Baby, you took control of me
And I got too many enemies
I knew you wanted to fuck him 'cause I could just tell
Check my back, now I'm, now I'm in my bag, yeah
You did me bad, you did me bad
But I said, "Fuck it," and I ran up my bag, yeah
I'm in my bag, I'm in my bag now
But you didn't even put it all on the line
For me, no, oh, I'm sorry
This is the end of us
It's crazy 'cause my heart is dangerous
Felt like you took my soul from me
Like the devil got a hold on me
Everybody wishin' bad on me
Everybody wishin' bad on me
You taught a lesson to me that I had to learn
And I'm so sorry 'cause you let our bridges burn
I said I loved you and I wish I never did
I swear to God, I swear to God, you stupid bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that we were meant to be
You took my heart and made it bleed
I gave you all my ecstasy
I know you'll be the death of me
Left lipstick on my Hennessy
Felt like you took my soul from me
No way, I gave you all my ecstasy
I thought that you were meant for me
I know you'll be the death of me
Thought we were for eternity
You fucked me up, both physically
And mentally, I can't believe

[Refrain]
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh

[Chorus]
Your love is suicidal
For me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal

[Outro]
You taught a lesson to me that I had to learn
And I'm so sorry 'cause you let our bridges burn
I said I loved you and I wish I never did
I swear to God, I swear to God, you stupid bitch
