Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
Can you stand the pain, stand the rain?
I'm insane, but somehow you ease the pain
I can buy you new designer thangs (
Yung Shad, you killed this track
)
Gucci, Louis, Prada, yeah, the finer thangs
Iced out Cuban Link, Rolex, VVS, pinky ring
Walk the same, talk the same
Stay the same, fuck the fame, never change

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I can not wait until (Until) they set me free (Free)
So I finally (Finally), can spend the rest of my days with you (My days)
Girl, I'm dangerously in love with you
Eternally (Eternally), not just mentally, but physically I am feeling you
And I really hope that you feeling me (Whoa)
Is you feeling me? (Whoa)
Hold it down for me and (Whoa) I promise that I'll take care of you
'Cause I can not wait until (Whoa) they set me free (Whoa)
So I finally, can spend the rest of my days with you

You know I'm thuggin', hit it with my durag on
Baby, can we please make love on a mattress full of hunnids? (Full of hunnids)
Feeling on your body, leaving hickeys on your stomach (On your stomach)
I'ma make you scream my name and have you drippin' like a faucet
Move too fast, I'm finna miss your ass, and make you get up off it

[Chorus 2]
I'm so glad that they have set me free
Now I finally, can spend the rest of my days with you

And I really hope that you're feeling me
