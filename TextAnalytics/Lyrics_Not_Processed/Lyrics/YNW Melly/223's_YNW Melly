[Intro: YNW Melly]
Rocco did it again
Oh, this bitch recordin'?
That's crazy, hah, yeah, slatt, you know, uh
Whole lot of gang shit
Baow, graow, baow, graow, blatt
Uh, slatt, slatt, hold up, uh, uh, slatt, uh

[Verse 1: YNW Melly]
Blood walk, baby, this the Blood walk, huh
I don't use my hands, I let the blood talk, huh
.223's and MACs'll make you blood walk
I can make any nigga hit the Crip walk
Crip walk, I'ma let my hip talk
Pulled a 40 with a dicky, gotta kill up y'all
Click, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And the clip is see-through

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
What all do you want from me?
AR's and them .223's
Fuckin' 'round with me, you see
I'm hot, I'm 500 degrees
Heard he caught a body
But that does not mean shit to me
Got two on me, got two on me
Blood Gang, yeah, SuWoop on me

[Verse 2: YNW Melly]
Detrimental
Me and Glokk all on your instrumental
I kill a nigga and it really wasn't coincidental
Stop all that flaggin' shit, you just be on that actin' shit
No, I ain't with no cappin' shit and I ain't on no rappin' shit
No lackin', bitch, you know it ain't no lackin', bitch
I check any Blood nigga like, "Ayy, man, what's brackin', bitch?"
I'm two floors up on you niggas
I'm two floors up on you niggas, yeah

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
What all do you want from me?
AR's and them .223's
Fuckin' 'round with me, you see
I'm hot, I'm 500 degrees
Heard he caught a body
But that does not mean shit to me
Got two on me, got two on me
Blood Gang, yeah, SuWoop on me

[Verse 3: 9lokkNine]
I'm like blatt (Uh-huh), we don't never play, he get whacked, like
Tryna find his face, ain't no trace, ain't comin' back
G-Nine, Mister Two-Glocks, just bought a MAC (Oh yeah)
A MAC for your facelift, rearrange your cap (Come here)
One foot in the industry and one foot in the trap
Invite that dope to my bloodline, I treat him like my strap
'Cause 'bout me he'll take a nigga's feet off the map
Big B's 'til I'm sleep, push a P, he get clapped
Two guns, that's the twin Glocks, I roger that
My heart colder than a bitch 'cause the bitch froze at that
Like apostrophe, Google forgot a comma in the back
Say I'm worth 250K, we can bet a trey on that, nigga

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
What all do you want from me?
AR's and them .223's
Fuckin' 'round with me, you see
I'm hot, I'm 500 degrees
Heard he caught a body
But that does not mean shit to me
Got two on me, got two on me
Blood Gang, yeah, SuWoop on me

[Outro: 9lokkNine]
Big blatt like SuWoop, mmh, yeah
What you want? What he want? Mmh, ayy, ayy
Big sticks for a punk, yeah, mmh
What he, uh, what he see? Yeah, uh, ayy, ayy
Big blatts 'cause I bleed, yeah, mhm
What he on, what he breathe? Yeah, ayy, ayy
I'm pushin' P's, pushin' P's, yeah, yeah
What it is and what it ain't, mmh, ayy, ayy
Like a skunk, we leave him stank
