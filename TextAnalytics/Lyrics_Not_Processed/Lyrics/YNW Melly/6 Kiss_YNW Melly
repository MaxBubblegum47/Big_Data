[Intro: Juice WRLD]
I love Trippie Redd
Oh, oh
Pourin' up fours, mud in my cup
Won't look at the past, it's behind us
Fallin' in a bottomless pit, find us
Life is a purge, sound of the sirens

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Do whatever I want, don't give a fuck, live my life, uh-huh, uh-huh
I got your wife, she my slut, she take nut, uh-huh, uh-huh
And I don't walk shit at all, I'm on the money run
I don't got no opps, they stay inside 'cause they scared of my guns
Your bitch said she want a real one, I told her, "Come and find one"
It's funny how you pussy, but you never been inside one
Ayy, these dumb-ass, virgin-ass niggas mad
They run when they see the gun in my hand
Bullets like Twitter, they follow them

[Verse 2: YNW Melly]
Nut, my kids, she swallow them, ooh, yeah, she swallow them
Boy, your chain ain't solid gold
Your jeweler finessed, he hollowed them
These niggas say they wit' it, uh, we gon' Harry Potter him (Pussy bitch)
Make that lil' bitch disappear, got VVS's in my ear

Chillin' on that couch, fuck your bitch in her mouth
Catch a nigga slippin', put it in his fucking house (Slatt)

[Bridge: YNW Melly]
