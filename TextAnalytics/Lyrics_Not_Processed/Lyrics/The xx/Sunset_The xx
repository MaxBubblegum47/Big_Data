[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
I saw you again, it felt like we had never met
It's like the sun set in your eyes i never want it to rise
And what have you done with the one I love?
When I look into your eyes, I see no surprise

[Chorus: Romy Madley Croft]
I always thought it was sad
The way we act like strangers
After all that we had
We act like we had never met

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim]
We make believe
I've never seen your face, you neither me
Don't catch my eye
Don't register a smile
You were more than just a friend, oh, but the feeling
It never came to an ending, I can't bear you seeing

[Chorus: Romy Madley Croft]
I always thought it was a shame
That we have to play these games
It felt like you really knew me
Now it feels like you see through me

[Bridge: Oliver Sim & 
Romy Madley Croft
]
When I see you again
I'll know not to expect
Stay one step away
We won't have to wait
When I see you again
And I'm greeted as a friend
It is understood
That we did all we could

[Chorus: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
I always thought it was sad
The way we act like strangers
After all that we had
We act like we had never met
I always thought it was a shame
That we have to play these games
It felt like you really knew me
Now it feels like you see through me
