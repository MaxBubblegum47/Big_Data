[Intro: Alessi Brothers]
Before it slips away

[Chorus 1: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Say something loving
I just don't remember the thrill of affection
I just don't remember
Say something loving
I need a reminder, the feeling's escaped me

[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
I went looking for it
Could have been anyone's kiss
Throwing my arms at no one
When I gave up, I found love

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim]
The thought flows through my mind
And it's growing all the time
I do myself a disservice
To feel this weak, to be this nervous

[Chorus 2: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
You say something loving
It's so overwhelming, the thrill of affection
Feels so unfamiliar
You say something loving
Without hesitation it hits me, hits me
It feels so unfamiliar

[Post-Chorus: Alessi Brothers]
Before it slips away

[Verse 3: Romy Madley Croft]
Your touch stays on my skin
I feel it start sinking in
Here come my insecurities
I almost expect you to leave

[Verse 4: Oliver Sim]
Were you really looking for me?
Try your best to reassure me
I wasn't patient to meet you
Am I too needy, am I too eager?

[Interlude: Romy Madley Croft & Oliver Sim]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Did you hear me say it?
Say it
Did you hear me say?

[Chorus 3: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
I say something loving
I can't hold it inside, the thrill of affection
Is only getting stronger
I say something loving
All my hesitations are fading, fading
I feel it taking over

[Outro: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft & Alessi Brothers]
Before it slips away
Don't let it slip away
Before it slips away
Don't let it slip away
