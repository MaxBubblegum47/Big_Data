[Verse 1: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
All I have, I will give to you
In dark times when no one wants to
I will give you me
And we'll be
Us
All I have, I will give to you
In dark times when no one wants to
I will give you me
And we'll be
Us

[Chorus: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
And there's no one else
Who knows me
Like you do
What I've done, you've done too
The walls I
Hide behind
You walk through
You just walk through

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Well I know all the words
To take you apart
You know I know your heart
I want to mend your heart
You're broke down
Why don't you tell me from the start?
You know I know your heart
I want to mend your heart

[Chorus: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
And there's no one else
Who knows me
Like you do
What I've done
You've done too
The walls I
Hide behind
You walk through
You just walk through
