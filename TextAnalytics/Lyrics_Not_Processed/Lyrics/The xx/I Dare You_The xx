[Verse 1: Oliver Sim]
I'm in love with it
Intoxicated
I'm in rapture
From the inside I can feel that you want to
Wake up high on it
Feel it suspending
I'm enamoured
Way up in the sky I can see that you want to

[Pre-Chorus: Romy Madley Croft]
I've been a romantic for so long
All I've ever heard are love songs

[Chorus: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Singing oh-oh-oh
Go on, I dare you
Oh-oh-oh
I dare you

[Verse 2: Romy Madley Croft & 
Oliver Sim
]
I get chills
Heart's rate multiplies
I'm on a different kind of high
A rush of blood is not enough
I need my feelings set on fire
Now I'm deep in it, infatuated
Strong attraction
Side by side, and I know that you want to

[Pre-Chorus: Romy Madley Croft]
I've been a romantic for so long
All I've ever heard are love songs

[Chorus: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Singing oh-oh-oh
Go on, I dare you
Oh-oh-oh
I dare you

[Bridge: Romy Madley Croft & 
together
]
I can hear it now like I heard it then
I can hear it now like I heard it then
I can hear it now like I heard it then
I can hear it now like I heard it then

[Chorus: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Singing oh-oh-oh
Go on, I dare you
Oh-oh-oh
I dare you
Oh-oh-oh
Go on, I dare you
Oh-oh-oh
I dare you
