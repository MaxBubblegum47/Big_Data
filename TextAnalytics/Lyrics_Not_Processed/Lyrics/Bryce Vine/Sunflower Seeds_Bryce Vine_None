[Chorus]
40 ounces and a pack of ranch sunflower seeds
40 answers to the questions she's asking of me
What you doing later on?
I got nowhere to be
No, no, no

[Verse 1]
Is my crew on?
What you on?
We been uptown cruising in the 
Yukon
Got a couple girls on my living futon
And they about to wake so better get a move on
Better get some food on
Cause when I'm hungry I'm a prick
I ate a Snickers but a Snick ain't doing shit
Argue over sushi or Italian for a bit
I say sake bombs
This something we agree upon
Later on we'll go on to the bar
Hand full of cash and a brain full of stars
I'm more thrown than a food fight
Feeling too right
Margarita by the pool side
Wow, this is all I ever wanted in life
Yeah, this is all I ever wanted tonight
And we said

[Chorus]
40 ounces and a pack of ranch sunflower seeds
40 answers to the questions she's asking of me
What you doing later on?
I got nowhere to be
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
And we've been roaming for a while, coast to coast
The bamboo 45, kicking up rocks
Kicking out dust on the roads of us
When we was very little
Malcolm in the Middle
I fly by in that all white coupe
Looking so clean in that all white suit
And them pretty black girls with them afro roots
Long legs, big hair, and them tie dye hoops
Later on move along to The Ville
In a warm summer home where the broads wanna chill
Thinking waves and I'm thinking sun
Thinking limes and I'm thinking rum
Thinking maybe you and I move away from the crowd
Got a little room in the back of the house
And everything's cool
Girl, we go together like water in a pool
And we said

[Chorus]
40 ounces and a pack of ranch sunflower seeds
40 answers to the questions she's asking of me
What you doing later on?
I got nowhere to be
No, no, no

[Verse 3]
Near the ocean
Near the water
Only good things
No piranha
All the good days of the views I love ain't never been so clear
Near the ocean
Near the water
Only good things
No piranha
All the good days of the views I love ain't never been so clear

[Chorus]
40 ounces and a pack of ranch sunflower seeds
40 answers to the questions she's asking of me
What you doing later on?
I got nowhere to be
No, no, no

[Outro]
Summer loving
Summer stay
Summer ready to roll
Diving deeper through the days where the rain on soft
What you doing later on?
I got nowhere to go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
