[Verse 1: Bryce Vine]
Yeah, house in the hills all white
Kinda look like a Apple Store
Sober, but that's all right
Kinda drunk from the night before
Hopin' I'm not too high
Full moon light, but you cracked the door
I don't know much what the blinds are for
Not another house 'round here for miles
Cigarette to the lip, look a little sad but she laughin' a bit
Tellin' me she glad that she found me and shit
That I hotline bling, hit you back in a sec
Look to the left, gun by the bed
Veer to the right, pills and a pipe
I don't know much anymore but a blind silhouette and the howl of a wolf in the night
Playing love songs, how ironic
Eyes roll back when she in the moment
L.A. star life, so iconic
They don't got ghosts but their houses haunted

[Pre-Chorus]
I think about takin' her out
A movie or maybe to dinner
Then her phone rang and her mood changed
'Cause her man will be home any minute

[Chorus: Emma Zander & Bryce Vine]
Everybody says you're no good
Bella you the best I ever had
Never wanna leave when I should
You're no good, but I like you bad
Everybody says you're no good
Bella you the best I ever had
Never wanna leave when I should
You're no good, but I like you bad

[Verse 2: Bryce Vine]
And when I wake up it's a quarter to seven
She already up and she raidin' the kitchen
She offer me coffee, I tell her, "No, thank you"
She pour me a cup anyway, but I'm grateful
Despite all the crazy she seem pretty cool
Grew up in London but Cali for school
Guess that explain why your accent is different and not really British but still in the pool, wow
If it isn't the same thing, it's the same thing twice
We ain't sayin' the same things that we did last night
You were givin' me goosebumps and the leg stretch
Arms out with your fists clenched
On the beach side got your thirst quenched
Ah man damn, now all I see is
Pretty girl in a Holiday Inn
Gram brag in a mansion or a hashtag in the Caribbean

[Pre-Chorus]
I think about takin' her out
A movie or maybe to dinner
Then her phone rang and her mood changed
'Cause her man will be home any minute

[Chorus: Emma Zander & Bryce Vine]
Everybody says you're no good
Bella you the best I ever had
Never wanna leave when I should
You're no good, but I like you bad
Everybody says you're no good
Bella you the best I ever had
Never wanna leave when I should
You're no good, but I like you bad

[Post-Chorus]
But I like you bad
You're no good, but I like you bad

[Outro]
You're no good, but I like you bad
