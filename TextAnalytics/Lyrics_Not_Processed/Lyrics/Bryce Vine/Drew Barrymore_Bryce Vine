[Verse 1]
I want this forever
Just you in the grotto
With nothin' but your nights on
Keep the fuckin' lights on
Same again tomorrow
We don't need no bottle
Purple color lip-gloss
Room at The Saguaro
Ain't nowhere I would rather be
Right between your holidays
Coffee on the flintstone
Jewelry on the ottoman
Baby, let me in, oh
For I get way too adamant about it
Love the way you shiver
Dig in to my shoulder blades
Feel it when you quiver
Higher level, elevate
You could be the renegade
Bonnie to a Clyde
Harrelson and Juliette
Legends never die
The TV hasn't worked in ages
Probably got a shorted cable
Way too busy fuckin' on the sofa or the kitchen table
Is my vision hazy?
You look like you're someone famous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah (Barry)
And I want more
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for, yeah

[Verse 2]
'Cause you're something like the summer
Kinda like a hurricane
Sweepin' through the desert
Hot Americana rain fallin'
Wearing nothing but my Lauryn Hill shirt
It's kinda baggy on you, baby, but it work
The AC hasn't worked in ages
I could probably read the label
Way too busy fuckin' on the counter or the coffee table
Am I hallucinating?
Why do you look hella famous?

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah (Barry)
And I want more (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for

[Bridge]
I wanna make
Every single moment for you great
Fly away to Cairo or LA
Girl, I want it now, don't wanna waste time, waste time
I wanna make, yeah
Every single moment for you great, yeah
Fly away to Cairo or LA
Girl, I want it now, don't wanna waste time

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
You're the next Drew Barry, yeah (Barry)
And I want more (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
