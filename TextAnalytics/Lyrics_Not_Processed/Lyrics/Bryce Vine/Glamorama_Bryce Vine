[Intro]
Do you wanna go out tonight
We can go to some clubs
It'll be fun

[Verse 1]
That girl a heart breaker
Tell you to move along
That girl a 
high staker
She so 
filet mignon
Living in the city fucking with the stars
Whipping around in 
hundred-thousand dollar cars
, yeah
She say her time is money
These niggas glad to pay
Love or bottle service
What more she gotta say
Bopping through the city on the boulevard
Skinny dipping at the Chateau Marmot

[Pre-Chorus]
She wilin'
She got them 
Gucci ruby shoes
Dancing at the club these niggas love the way she move
She riding
Out to a party in 
the hills
Bumping on the coca
 cause she love the way it feels
She lying
That girl won't ever fall in love
She pretty, too pretty to really ever give a fuck
But you don't really got to stress
Do whatever you wanna

[Chorus]
Cause everything is perfect in the life of 
glamorama

[Verse 2]
That girl a soul shaker
She got that rebel yell
That girl a whole caker
She eat it all herself
Out the window singing 
Lucy in the sky
Pack of demons
 and the 
devil by her side
That girl a hard worker though
She be her own supporter
Money, sleep, money, eat, money
In that order
With the posse knocking shots and doing drugs
27 still be feeling 21

[Pre-Chorus]
And she wilin'
She got them Gucci ruby shoes
Dancing at the club these niggas love the way she moves
She riding
Out to a party in the hills
Bumping on the coca cause she love the way it feels
She lying
That girl won't ever fall in love
She pretty, too pretty to really ever give a fuck
But she don't really got to stress
Do whatever you wanna

[Chorus]
Cause everything is perfect in the life of glamorama

[Interlude]
I always wondered about the life of a fashion model
Well now you know
I can quit anytime

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And she wilin'
Way on the other side of town
The grass is only greener every time she comes around
She riding
Out to a desert in the eve
Drop at tab of acid and she swear she'll never leave
But she lying
That girl won't ever fall in love
She pretty, too pretty and ain't nobody good enough
But she don't really got to stress
Do whatever you wanna

[Chorus]
Cause everything is perfect girl your life is glamorama
In the life of glamorama
