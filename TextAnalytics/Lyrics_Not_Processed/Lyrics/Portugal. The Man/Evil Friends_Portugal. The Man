[Intro]
Your mama's got nothin' on me, your daddy's got nothin' on me
An' the world that sleeps in its lunacy, it's got nothin' on me
No stars got nothin' on me, your son's got nothin' on me
An' the fool who sees it's the thief that leads has got nothin' on me

[Intro Chorus]
You know it's not because the light here gets brighter
An' it's not that I'm evil, I got a friend in the devil
But I can't even be your friend, I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend

[Guitar Riff]

[Verse 1]
I can get so wound up, but I feel alright
An' if I get some rest, yeah, that'd be nice
When I shouldn't do it, I still do it
What you think's got nothin' to do with this
Before you were born, I was already sinnin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
When I get too worked up, well I work it out
An' if I get too down, I just shout it out
I may not have it all, but the rest will do
An' it's nothin' against or to do with you
Before you were born, I was already sinnin'

[Chorus]
It's not because the light here is brighter
An' it's not that I'm evil,
 
I just don't like to pretend
That I could ever be your friend

[Verse 2]
If you don't listen so good, I can hum it out
Na, na, na, na, na, na-na-na!
I know I shouldn't do it, I just do it
An' what you think's got nothin' to do with it
Before you were born, I was already sinnin'

[Chorus]
It's not because the light here is brighter
An' it's not that I'm evil,
 
I just don't like to pretend
I could be your friend, I could never be your friend
I never needed a friend, I don't wanna be friends

[Outro]
You'll never find a friend like me
