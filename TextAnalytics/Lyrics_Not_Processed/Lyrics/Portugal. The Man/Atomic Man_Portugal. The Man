[Verse 1]
You're feeling tired, I know three's a crowd
But if I bring along a friend it'll be fine for now
Man, I can't help it, I'm just always in the middle
Read the bible in the evening, hang with demons on the weekend

[Chorus]
After you, I don't know what I believe in
After you, Hell should be easy
After you, I don't know what I believe in
After you, Hell should be easier

[Interlude]
(Gotta, gotta, gotta get out if you wanna get it)

[Verse 2]
Follow that little red bouncing ball
As it bounced 'round the galaxy came back to us all
The little bit he learned about outer space is
It's gotta destroy before it creates

[Chorus]
After you, I don't know what I believe in
After you, Hell should be easy
After you, I don't know what I believe in
After you, Hell would be easier

[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm the golden baby born into the center
Mother was a gun and I fed nature to the beggars
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Always talking but the kids never listen
They die in the evening, become demons for the weekend

[Chorus]
After you, I don't know what I believe in
After you, Hell should be easy
After you, I don't know what I believe in
After you, Hell will be easier

[Outro]
Tides that take the sand
I'm atomic man
I'm the moon that pulls the tides that take the sand
I'm atomic man
I'm the moon that pulls the tides that take the sand
I'm atomic man
I'm the moon that pulls the tides that take the sand
I'm atomic man
I'm the moon that pulls the tides that take the sand
I'm atomic man
I'm the moon that pulls the tides that take the sand
I'm atomic man
I'm the moon that pulls the tides that take the sand
