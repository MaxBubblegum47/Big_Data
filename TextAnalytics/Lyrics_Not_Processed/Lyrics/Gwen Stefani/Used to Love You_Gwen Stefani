[Verse 1]
Never thought this would happen
Gotta let it sink in, you're gone
Don't know, know what I'm feeling
I must be dreaming, you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Suitcase, band-aids
Pulling back out the driveway
You go, I'll stay
You can keep all the memories
I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you
I thought you loved me the most

[Chorus]
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you

[Verse 2]
You thought there were no boundaries
But you just pushed me too far
I guess nobody taught you
Nobody taught you how to love

[Pre-Chorus]
Suitcase, band-aids
Pulling back out the driveway
You go, I'll stay
You can keep all the memories
I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you
I thought you loved me the most

[Chorus]
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you

[Bridge]
You know I was the best thing that ever happened to you
Oh, now look at what you lost
You know I was the best thing that ever happened to you
Now look at what you lost, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you

[Outro]
I don't know why I cry
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't know why I used to love you
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't know why I cry
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't know why I used to love you
I don't, I don't, I don't
