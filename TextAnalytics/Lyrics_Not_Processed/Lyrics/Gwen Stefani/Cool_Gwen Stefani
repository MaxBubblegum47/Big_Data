[Verse 1]
It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I found the love of my life
Passes, things get more comfortable
Everything is going right

[Chorus 1]
And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

[Verse 2]
And we used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain

[Chorus 2]
Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown
We have changed, but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Yeah, I know we're cool

[Chorus 3]
And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hangin' out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

[Outro]
C-cool, uh-uh, I know we're cool, uh-uh
I-I know we're cool
C-cool, yeah, I know we're cool
Me and you
