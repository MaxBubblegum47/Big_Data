Dude, I just called the plug and his phone was unplugged
I was lookin' at Doug like (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Like having fuckin' arguments for payin' fifty extra cents for barbecue
Saucing on the workers at McDonald's

But my baby mama stopped me in a meeting (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Verse 4: DaBaby]
Goddamn
Think I got a new lawsuit, I need to come see you (What's that?)
I got a new whip, you know what a car do
Turn your bitch to a eater (Mmh, mmh)
She say we don't got enough room to get freaky in here
'Cause it's just a two-seater (Okay, question)
Am I still considered a trick if I get her a hoopty
And buy me a Bimmer? (Uh-uh)
I had a new case but the judge had to throw it out
My lawyer beat it like Tina
I always find a way to get ahead with my intelligence
When they critique my demeanor (Hah)
Today I'll dress up a Republican (What else?)
And go get some head from a white man's daughter
Her lips aren't big but I'm loving it (Mwah)
I get in, fake ID, I'm McLovin it (Yeah)
BDB ENT like the government (What?)
Except for the cops (Who?), mission impossible
Strapped with the Glock, Danny Gloverin'
Tip a hundred if you let my cousin in
You know everybody my cousin (Cuz)
Oh yeah, and I gotta be thuggin' it
'Cause my hair can get nappy as fuck
I wear jewelry and I got that chocolate coloring

[Interlude: DaBaby]
Well at least, like you know, that's what they make me feel like
Why they make you feel like that?
I don't know, I mean it's America, right?

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
Ooh, hot damn, hot water, hot shower
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour
