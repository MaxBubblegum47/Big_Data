I want a brand new whip (Skr skr)
I want a brand new house
I want a foreign lil' bitch
She put it all in her mouth (Skr skr)
I want it so I'ma go get it (Skr skr)
I want it so I'ma go get it (Skr skr)
I want it so I'ma go get it (Skr skr)
I want it so I'ma go get it
I want a brand new whip

I want it so I'ma go get it
I want it so I'ma go get it
I want it so I'ma go get it

Leather jacket with a long shirt
She working that wrist 'til her arm hurt
Never slackin' nigga, all work
My ex want me back I won't call her
