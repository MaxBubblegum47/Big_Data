[Verse 1]
Ay, we done came a long way, traveled down the wrong way
They ain't find no shell cases, thankful for the cold case
Thankful for the prostitutes, assumin' that we soulmates
Thankful for the big homie, coached me through the dope game
Boogers clutter both chains, Euros huggin' both lanes
Caught up in this style of livin', couldn't if I want to change
Hang out on the porch with yay, out on bail, forced to pray
God is good, God is great, I thank you for another day
Thank you for this 100K, thank you for my girly face
I was too broke to ever visualize the world this way
Trapped inside a world of pain, I trapped for every quarter gained
I don't do this shit for fame, bitch, I do this shit for gang
Since when did I go against the grain? Gave them niggas sticks to bang
Helped them niggas get them chains and showed the hood a different way
Bust it down and deviate it, everybody seein' paper
I just want to see you make it, incubator 80's baby

[Chorus]
One up top ahky, somethin' stocky in the choppy
Fat wally for bradaski, off a Oxy, bet he mop 'em
Pour a four of wocky, vision cloudy, sleep walkin'
Pour a four of wocky, vision cloudy sleep walkin'
One up top ahky, somethin' stocky in the choppy
Fat wally for bradaski, off a Oxy, bet he mop 'em
Pour a four of wocky, vision cloudy, sleep walkin'
Pour a four of wocky, vision cloudy sleep walkin'

[Verse 2]
All them trials and tribulations, bail enhancements and arraignments
Affidavits and them statements, waitin' game, so I waited
The numbers double up when niggas labeled 'gang related'
Plus I'm in and out of family court for Dooters, shit was brazy
Child Protective Services, only thing can break me
Family of a murder victim, only reason you should hate me
I been feeling smothered lately, blood called me for the yankee
He ain't even call to thank me for that put on I just gave him
I miss my brother Deezy, only if those bullets grazed him
Wasn't no hatred in my heart until that happened, that's what changed me
My last trip to Quentin for that yicki really saved me
I was movin' mainey every daily, on my baby, nigga
Shoot you if you if you make me, nigga, E we finally made it nigga!
Mozzy Shawn callin' from the bounty, "What you facin', nigga?"
Shout out to the Asian boys, I love you for them katas nigga
Call me when you need me, y'all forever in my favor nigga

[Chorus]
One up top ahky, somethin' stocky in the choppy
Fat wally for bradaski, off a Oxy, bet he mop 'em
Pour a four of wocky, vision cloudy, sleep walkin'
Pour a four of wocky, vision cloudy sleep walkin'
One up top ahky, somethin' stocky in the choppy
Fat wally for bradaski, off a Oxy, bet he mop 'em
Pour a four of wocky, vision cloudy, sleep walkin'
Pour a four of wocky, vision cloudy sleep walkin'
