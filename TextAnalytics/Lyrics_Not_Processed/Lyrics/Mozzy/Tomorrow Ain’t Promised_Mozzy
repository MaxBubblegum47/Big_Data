{Verse 1: Mozzy}
Minimum wage, I remember them days
Digital clocks, see what it physically say
Now we sippin' this paint, uplifted through rank
I pull out 30K when I dip in the bank
Oh, what a beautiful day, the day that my shooters get paid
Pay 'em to chew off your face, think that I'm truly insane
Lately been loosin' my faith, look what I do for the gang
They did like two in the day, we did a few in the day
Yicki come with the chain, we gotta move this way
Crackers been trackin' the chat, that's how they knew the play
Young nigga tootin' pay, too impatient to move the yay
Type in his government name, make sure the shooter straight
{Chorus: Rexx Life Raj}
I've been so low key
I know you been lookin' for me
Niggas who were down
I felt them switchin' on me
I had to get it by my lonely
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised
No it ain't, so we gonna get it all today
Tomorrow ain't promised to you (to you)
No it ain't (no it ain't), so we gonna find a way
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised
{Verse 2: Boosie Badass}
You can bet it (life's a bitch)
Shit will make you lose your mind 3 times if you let it
All I need is a check and everything else I could check
No matter how real, it's hard to get everyone to respect ya
Raise the blade, stay dirty as a teen (I was wild)
{?}
 with a 30 and a beam
Flashes so you can see 'em
Sixteen out the mud and I'm a man now
Sixteen but I buy groceries for my granny house
Niggas dyin' everyday what do we do about
A nigga makin' threats with a TEC, shoot it out
Niggas changin' like the weather on a nigga
Ain't too many hopin' better for a nigga, good heart
I'm the type to give my sweater to a nigga from the start
Hope my killas never have a change of heart
You told in the end before so long she played the part
You either push dope or get a job and push the cart
Tomorrow ain't promised
{Chorus: Rexx Life Raj}
I've been so low key
I know you been lookin' for me
Niggas who were down
I felt them switchin' on me
I had to get it by my lonely
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised
No it ain't, so we gonna get it all today
Tomorrow ain't promised to you
No it ain't, so we gonna find a way
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised
{Verse 3: E-Mozzy}
I know a lot niggas out here see me fallin'
They just hatin' on the fella if you let me call it
Don't waste time 'cause this life you can't pause it
I'm havin' dreams about my nigga 'cause I can't call him
If you a boss, you know the deal when you take loses
When you in the spotlight you gotta stay cautious
Everyday my mom got a call from the office
If you don't hustle, you don't eat, that's what my granny taught me
I'm bussin' down with my brother 'cause he starved with me
Your bitch on my Iinea, yea I tell her talk to me
When you down on your knees you can't call many
They call me easy layup, all I do is talk money
To live in Hollywood cost me a soft twenty
Ask her where's the counter tell her bring it out to me
The little weight that you carry don't amount to me
Tell 'em bring the drama, streets know I got shots with me
{Chorus: Rexx Life Raj}
I've been so low key
I know you been lookin' for me
Niggas who were down
I felt them switchin' on me
I had to get it by my lonely
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised
No it ain't, so we gonna get it all today
Tomorrow ain't promised to you
No it ain't, so we gonna find a way
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised
