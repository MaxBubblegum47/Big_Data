[Verse 1]
She got a smile that makes your worst day
Feel like it's your birthday
She's got a laugh like confetti
Would change her name if she'd let me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's got a way of changing the game
The way that you play, it's never the same

[Chorus]
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Ride around, windows down
Yell with the radio
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Drop your plans, drop a grand
Hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her
She make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall
Make you want it all, make you wanna call
She make you wanna die for her

[Verse 2]
The way that she moves
Is like a soft glow, flicker of a candle
She turns my cool into disaster
Heart is pumping faster

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She's head to toe, body and soul
So beautiful, she don't even know

[Chorus]
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Ride around, windows down
Yell with the radio
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Drop your plans, drop a grand
Hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her
She make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall
Make you want it all, make you wanna call

[Post-Chorus]
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah

[Bridge]
For her, I would walk a straight line
Wear out the soles in my shoes
For her, I would run through the night
Just to kiss her one more time
If she wanted me to

[Chorus]
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Ride around, windows down
Yell with the radio
She's the kind that makes you wanna
Drop your plans, drop a grand
Hell where the money goes
She make you wanna fight for her
She make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall
Make you want it all, make you wanna call

[Post-Chorus]
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
She make you wanna die for her
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah
