[Verse 1: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
Duffle bag, backseat
My dash, your feet
Those other side of the highway headlights making you shine
My hand, your leg
Playlist playing
Even though I haven't made it yet
I'm dragging it, dropping it in my mind

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl

[Verse 2: Tori Kelly & Chris Lane]
You're the kind I wanna take a ride with
Sit by on a Friday night
In the stadium lights, side by side
All the ladies like, "Yeah, she's doing just fine"
Everybody in the bleachers, they all gon' want to meet ya
From my teachers to my preacher
My little crowd pleaser
Parading with you feeling homecoming cool, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
I wanna drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl

[Post-Chorus: Chris Lane & 
Tori Kelly
]
You're a take back, you're a take back
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home
You're a take back home girl

[Bridge: Chris Lane]
You got that down-home, homegrown, found on good ground soul
That down-home, homegrown, found on good ground soul

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl

[Post-Chorus: Chris Lane & 
Tori Kelly
]
You're a take back, you're a take back
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home, yeah
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home
