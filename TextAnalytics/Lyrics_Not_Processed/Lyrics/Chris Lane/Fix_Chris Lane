[Verse 1]
Hey girl, you know what you been missing?
Me, me, yeah
Hey girl, whoever you been kissing
It ain't me, me
I got that love medicinal
I'll make you feel invincible
I'm more than recreational
I'm what you need

[Chorus]
I'll be your smooth ride, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that so right
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
With that good ish, that long trip, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, gotta have it, you can't quit
I got your fix

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be the high that never lets you down (I got your fix)
The one you crave when no one is around (I got your fix)
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go, hey hey

[Verse 2]
Hey hey
Hey girl, he don't get you there never
So leave, oh just leave
Listen, baby baby baby baby girl
Let me make it feel better
Please, please, please, please
I'm what you need

[Chorus]
I'll be your smooth ride, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that so right
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
With that good ish, that long trip, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, gotta have it, you can't quit
I got your fix

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be the high that never lets you down (That never lets you down)
The one you crave when no one is around (When no one is around)
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go

[Bridge]
Yeah, come on baby, yeah, mmm mmm mmm
I'll be the high that never lets you down
The one you crave when no one is around

[Chorus]
I'll be your smooth ride, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that  so right
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
With that good ish, that long trip, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, gotta have it, you can't quit
I got your fix

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be the high that never lets you down (That never lets you down)
The one you crave when no one is around (When no one is around)
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go
