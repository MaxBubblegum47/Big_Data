[Verse 1]
I don’t know about you
But I never come into this bar
On a Thursday before 10 o’clock
But I thought what the hell, why not?
I don’t know about you
But I never walk up and talk to
A stranger but when I saw you
I had to, I just had to

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I know your favourite beer
'Cause you told me and I bought it
You can leave me sitting right here
But if you feel like talking

[Chorus]
What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)
What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin round and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you

[Verse 2]
I don’t know about you
We can dip, we can slip out the back
Flee the scene, put your feet on my dash
Find a spot past the railroad tracks and never look back
But before that

[Chorus]
What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)
What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin around and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you

[Bridge]
I know you like Bud Light
I know you got blue eyes
I know you got my heart beating in this bar
Tonight we can jump in, fall into something
And the perfect place to start is

[Chorus]
What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)
What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin around and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you

[Outro]
Tell me everything, tell me everything
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you
Tell me everything, tell me everything
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you
