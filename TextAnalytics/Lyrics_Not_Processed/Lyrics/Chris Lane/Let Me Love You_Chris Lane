[Verse 1 ]
Baby I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume
The make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around
And I just don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are

[Chorus]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you
Yeah, Listen

[Verse 2]
Your true beautyâ€™s description
Look so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus 99
And it's a shame, don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go, they stop and stare
Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes
Out of control, baby you know

[Pre-Chorus]
If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are

[Chorus]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you
Yeah, Listen

[Pre-Chorus]
If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are

[Chorus]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
Baby, you should let me love you
