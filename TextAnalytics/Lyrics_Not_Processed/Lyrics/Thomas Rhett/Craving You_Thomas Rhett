[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
I never had something that I can't walk away from
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience
There's something 'bout you girl I just can't fight

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you
Craving you

[Verse 2: Thomas Rhett]
All the in-between is killing me
You know I come unglued from missing you
Sunset eyes, no, I don't have to try
Because you know exactly what to do

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
I never had something that I can't walk away from (walk away from)
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience (I ain't got no patience)
There's something 'bout you I just can't fight

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you
Craving you

[Post Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
I'm always craving you
Craving you
Craving you

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you, yeah
Craving you

[Post Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
Craving you
I'm craving you baby
I'm craving you
I'm craving you babe
