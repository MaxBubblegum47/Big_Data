[Verse 1]
"Take a left here, boy, take it slow
Don't get distracted by that radio"
I just rolled my eyes and I said, "Daddy, I know
I'm fifteen, I ain't green like some ol' ten year old"

[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be sixteen, wild and free
Cruisin' up and down Main in my F-150
Roll the windows down, bass too loud from this burnt CD
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm sixteen, sixteen, yeah
Sixteen

[Verse 2]
Now that I can drive, finally feel alive, but I got this curfew
Sneakin' in late, smelling like my girlfriend's perfume
People talkin' 'bout college and knowledge and that's alright
But all I'm thinkin' 'bout is an unsupervised Saturday night

[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be eighteen, wild and free
Buzzin' off a can of that Grizzly wintergreen
Lookin' old enough to pull off this fake ID
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm eighteen, eighteen
Eighteen, yeah

[Bridge]
I'm old enough to smoke, I'm old enough to vote
But they turn me away when I go to the Cotton-Eyed Joe
They say the grass is always greener, and I believe that's right
But my friends are off to Vegas, and they're leavin' me behind

[Chorus]
What I wouldn't give to be twenty one, wild and free
Open up a cold one and drink it legally
Chase a bunch of girls, go see the world, let my wild streak run
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm twenty one, twenty one
Woah, when I'm twenty one
Yeah, when I'm twenty one, it'll be alright
Yeah, it'll all be alright when I'm twenty one

[Outro]
Now I'm twenty five, and I'm drinkin' wine with my wife at home
Got a couple dogs and a couple songs on the radio
And we sit around, and we laugh about how we used to be
When all we cared about was turning sixteen
