[Chorus]
Uh, look baby let me change your plans and wrap my hands around your waist tonight
And baby girl I feel the vibes the time is right girl I'm gonna make you mine
You told me that your heart so cold Don't get too close your love is worth the try
We too high up in the sky maybe never land we more than friends
Girl your all alone let's make some plans tonight

[Verse 1]
She fall in love with a real one
Your ex just your past done moved on
I been waiting for your love and waited too long
Girl you make me nervous I can't move wrong
Baby it ain't cool that you be change'n
I need you by my side just for the night let's make arrangements
Your vibe so immaculate baby and it's amazing
I looked you in your eyes so bae don't switch when I get famous
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know
Hop up out the wraith into the ghost
She fine as hell she know'n that she know
She change my mood I like the view on yah

[Chorus]
Uh, look baby let me change your plans and wrap my hands around your waist tonight
And baby girl I feel the vibes the time is right girl I'm gonna make you mine
You told me that your heart so cold Don't get too close your love is worth the try
We too high up in the sky maybe never land we more than friends
Girl your all alone let's make some plans tonight

[Verse 2]
I started off up in the field with a cold heart till I seen you rolling in and I stood strong
Make some plans for tonight ain't gotta stay long
I'm messing with you cause you saw me through all my flaws
Knowing one day that we all gonna ball
You was messing with me I was running from the law
If you need some love only take one call
We still rolling on one wheel cause the rest fell off

[Chorus]
Uh, look baby let me change your plans and wrap my hands around your waist tonight
And baby girl I feel the vibes the time is right girl I'm gonna make you mine
You told me that your heart so cold Don't get too close your love is worth the try
We too high up in the sky maybe never land we more than friends
Girl your all alone let's make some plans tonight
