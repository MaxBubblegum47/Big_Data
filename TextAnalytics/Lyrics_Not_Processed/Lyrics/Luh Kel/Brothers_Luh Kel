[Intro: Bankrol Hayden]
Ayy, look

[Chorus: Bankrol Hayden]
It's love for my brothers, no love for these bitches
They say they gon' change, but I ain't gon' listen
She fucked with my friend, she had to admit it
My mind has been trippin', they burning these bridges

[Verse 1: Bankrol Hayden]
Screaming fuck love, let's just run up them digits
We talk for some years, I ain't talkin' 'bout minutes
Free my big brother, he stuck in the prison
You say you victim and playin', you meant it
You did some shit and I cannot forget it
Love for my brothers, no love for these bitches
Now that you got me, my head going spinning
All of my friends, they like, "Hayden, you trippin'"

[Refrain: Bankrol Hayden]
Like damn, why you do it like that?
How you do me like that?
How you do it like that?
I can't even call back
You just stabbed me in the back
I'ma fall right back

[Verse 2: Bankrol Hayden]
You talkin' like all that, but fuck it, it's all cap
Your brother, he a bitch, and my brothers, we all that
You actin' like a female, you call me and call back
I wanna make it out my city and give back

[Chorus: Bankrol Hayden]
It's love for my brothers, no love for these bitches
They say they gon' change, but I ain't gon' listen
She fucked with my friend, she had to admit it
My mind has been trippin', they burning these bridges
It's love for my brothers, no love for these bitches
They say they gon' change, but I ain't gon' listen
She fucked with my friend, she had to admit it
My mind has been trippin', they burning these bridges

[Refrain: Bankrol Hayden]
Like damn, why you do it like that?
How you do me like that?
How you do it like that?
I can't even call back
You just stabbed me in the back
I'ma fall right back (I'ma fall right back)
I'ma fall right back (I'ma fall right back), yeah

[Verse 3: Luh Kel]
I love all my brothers, I feel like I'm needing you
Your body a drug, girl, I fiend for you
Think of you daily, you think that I'm shady
You acting so crazy, it's me and you
Love, now I need it
Girl, you gave me your love, now I'm fiending
Got my heart broke but you pick up the pieces
Baby, don't go, girl, I hate when you leavin', yeah (Yeah)
But girl, it's whatever, just do what you wanna
We pop at the mall, we got Dolce Gabbana
Your face on Beyonc√© but body Rihanna
I love how you stuntin', you drippin' designer (Oh, oh)
Got 'em looking but I'm knowing that they won't try
You got my heart, I tell the truth, feel like I can't lie
Call my phone and we can talk until the sunrise

[Chorus: Bankrol Hayden]
It's love for my brothers, no love for these bitches
They say they gon' change, but I ain't gon' listen
She fucked with my friend, she had to admit it
My mind has been trippin', they burning these bridges
