[Intro]
Na, na, na, na, na
Everytime I miss you
And I love to hear your voice, sound like an instrumental
Na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 1]
I pull up to your crib everytime I miss you
And I love to hear your voice, sound like an instrumental (Instumental, yeah)
Girl, I be going on all these trips but love it when I'm with you
And you know when I pull up we settle all our issues
It's Thanksgiving so you lovin' on the way I eat it
Michael Jackson, I'm in it, you lovin' how I beat it
If I tell you I love you baby I really mean it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I really miss your body, you know that I need it (Woah)

[Chorus]
You feelin' sick from all the motion
Girl I love it when I'm in your ocean
Touching on you, I swear you got the potion (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Loving on you, I swear you got the potion (Yeah)
And girl I leave you soakin'
Girl you got me high but I ain't smokin'
I'ma give you 'bout everything you wanted
Gas you up to the sky, got you floating
But you know this

[Bridge]
Yeah, right crowd
Them others boys they need to pipe down (Pipe down)
You and me, baby we alone so that's the right sound (Right sound)
And I like it when we alone so turn them lights out
Ain't no Netflix and Chillin', I want it right now

[Verse 2]
I like it when we cruisin'
Yeah, niggas be talkin' but girl you really do it
And you knew it
Yeah you had a nigga before me so now you choosin' (Ohh)
Ballin' like LeBron and Kobe so there ain't no losin'

[Outro]
You got my eyes open, girl you the only one I want
And ain't no option, cause I've been waiting on you for months (Yeah)
You the only one I want, you the only one I need, you the only one I see
You the only one I need
When you hold a .223, baby got me on my knees (Yeah)
You the only one I want, you the only one I need, you the only one I see
You the only one I need
When you hold a .223, baby got me on my knees (Yeah)
