CashMoneyAP
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah

[Chorus]
I knew one day that I'm gon' make it
I just gotta take it slow
I know you here to heal all this pain
So I can't take it no more (Can't take it)
And I know I need your love so just hold me close
I had to freeze to stop the rain, made my heart so cold

[Verse]
They told me pain'll leave me soon
But it won't leave 'til I got you
I need you right by my side, let's vibe
I shoot my shot like a Glock do
You just need some love, I do too so that's okay
And girl, I need you more
Stay with my call, make sure you safe

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you always gotta come at me sideways?
We fell in love, we fell in love but in the worst way
You bring me back, you bring me back
To them old days
Shawty why you gotta bring me to my old ways?

[Chorus]
I knew one day that I'm gon' make it
I just gotta take it slow
I know you here to heal all this pain
So I can't take it no more (Can't take it)
And I know I need your love so just hold me close
I had to freeze to stop the rain, made my heart so cold

[Bridge]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why do I feel like I need you by my side?
I can't take it no more, I know you ride
Girl just stay on the low
I know you try but just give me some more

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you always gotta come at me sideways?
We fell in love we fell in love but in the worst way
You bring me back you bring me back
To them old days
Shawty why you gotta bring me to my old ways?

[Chorus]
I knew one day that I'm gon' make it
I just gotta take it slow
I know you here to heal all this pain
So I can't take it no more (Can't take it)
And I know I need your love so just hold me close
I had to freeze to stop the rain, made my heart so cold
