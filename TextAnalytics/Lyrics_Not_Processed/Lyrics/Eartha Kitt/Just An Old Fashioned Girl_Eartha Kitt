I'm just an old fashioned girl with an old fashioned mind
Not sophisticated, I'm the sweet and simple kind
I want an old fashioned house, with an old fashioned fence
And an old fashioned millionaire

I want an old fashioned car, a cerise Cadillac
Long enough to put a bowling alley in the back
I want an old fashioned house, with an old fashioned fence
And an old fashioned millionaire

I'll stay weaving at my loom
Be no trouble to my groom
If he'll keep the piles of money mounting
In our cottage there will be
A soundproof nursery
Not to wake the baby while I'm counting

I like the old fashioned flowers, violets are for me -
Have them made in diamonds by the man at Tiffany
I want an old fashioned house, with an old fashioned fence
And an old fashioned millionaire

I'm just a pilgrim at heart, oh so pure and genteel
Watch me in Las Vegas while I'm at the spinning wheel!
I want an old fashioned house, with an old fashioned fence
And an old fashioned millionaire

I'll ask for such simple things when my birthday occurs:
Two apartment buildings that are labeled 'Hers' and 'Hers'
I want an old fashioned house, with an old fashioned fence
And an old fashioned millionaire

I like Chopin and Bizet
And the songs of yesterday
String quartets and Polynesian carols
But the music that excels
Is the sound of oil wells
As they slurp, slurp, slurp into the barrels

Our little home will be quaint as an old parasol
And instead of carpets I'll have money wall to wall
I want an old fashioned house, with an old fashioned fence
And an old fashioned millionaire
