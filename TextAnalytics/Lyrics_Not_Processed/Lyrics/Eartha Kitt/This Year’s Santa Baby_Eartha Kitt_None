Santa Baby, I must admit that you were a dear last year
But December is here
Santa Baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Baby, that Cadillac is falling apart, won't start
A private plane would be smart
Santa Baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Though the yacht was rather sheik
Now it's really shot
Last week it sprang a leak
And so please, now, hold your breath
Buy me the Queen Elizabeth

Santa Baby, that sable's really not in the pink
Just think, how I'd look in white mink
Santa Baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Darlin, I need some land so please be my host
To most of the Florida coast
Santa Baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa Cutie, and please help out my pet charity
You see, Naturally that's me
Santa Cutie, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Bring a nice big Christmas box
Filled with plain old ordinary common stocks
And please trim up my tree this Yule
With one large pear shaped swimming pool

Santa Baby, for every little trinket you give
I live, be appreciative
Santa Baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
There's only 365 days till Christmas...
