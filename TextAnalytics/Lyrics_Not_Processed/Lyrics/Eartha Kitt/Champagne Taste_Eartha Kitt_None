Do you wanna take me cruising on an ocean liner to places I long to see?
Well, with my champagne taste and your beer bottle pockets
Don't forget to write me when you get there in your row-boat
When you've paddled across the sea without me

Do you see us dining on caviar and pheasant with decedents of royalty?
Well with my champagne taste and your beer bottle pockets
I'll be having pheasant while you're dining with the peasants
Dunking donuts in a diner without me

You said, "You have ambition to make my dream come true"
Well brother you just keep right on wishing
And all of my dreams will come true, without you

Do you see me in a jaguar with all the accessories
And one of those accessories is you?
Well with my champagne taste and your beer bottle pocket
Take back your jaguar accessories etcetera
And drive back to your dreamland without me

And if I wanted diamonds you'd offer me breakfast at Tiffanie's
And luncheons at Cartier's you'd recommend
Well with my champagne taste and your beer bottle pockets
You will have to work-on something better than a zircon
Because your diamonds of this girl's are worst friend

You said, "You'd promise me anything to make my life a feast"
You didn't give me anything, not even arpege you beast
And it wouldn't surprise me if a lady like Godiva
Had someone like you to give her the stole

For with her champagne taste and your beer bottle pocket
When she couldn't get those dresses
She just let down all her tresses and forgot she was a lady after all

So if you want me to be apart of your permanent employ
Before my champagne fizzles come up with the real McCoy
Show me you can separate the man from the boy
And bring me a constant life of champagne taste
