[Verse 1]
Need you for the old me, need you for my sanity
Need you to remind me where I come from
Can you remind me of my gravity?
Ground me when I'm tumblin', spiralin', plummetin' down to Earth
You keep me down to Earth
Call me on my bullshit
Lie to me and say my booty gettin' bigger even if it ain't
Love me even if it rain
Love me even if it pain you
I know I be difficult
You know I be difficult
You know it get difficult too

[Chorus]
Open your heart up
Hoping I'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
And hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me
You'll never love me but, I believe you when you say it like that
Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?
Oh, I believe you when you say it like that
You must really love me

[Verse 2]
For real, I'm not playing no games
Boy, we back and forth
I need your support now (now, now, now, now, now)
In case you call my phone one more 'gain
Got no panties on
I need your support now (now, now, now, now, now)
I know you'd rather be laid up with a big booty
Prolly hella positive 'cause she got a big booty (wow)
I know I'd rather be paid up
You know I'm sensitive about havin' no booty
Havin' nobody, only you, buddy
Can you hold me when nobody's around us?

[Chorus]
Open your heart up
Hoping I'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
And hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me
You'll never love me but, I believe you when you say it like that
Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?
Oh, I believe you when you say it like that
You must really love me

[Skit: Granny]
You don't have shit to say to me
I ain't got shit to say to you
Granny, and that's the truth
And ste
p
, and step on
Also you black heffa, yeah you, you stand your ground
'Cause 
I feel the s
ame way
If you don't like me, you don't have to fool with me
You don't have to talk about me or treat me mean
I don't have to treat you mean
I just stay out of your way
That's the way you work that one
