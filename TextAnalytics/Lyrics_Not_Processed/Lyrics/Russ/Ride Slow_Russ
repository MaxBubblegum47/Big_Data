[Intro]
Ride slow
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm pullin' up at 3
This car just ain't the same without you here next to me
All I wanna do is ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow, like a ghost
Ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow, like a ghost
I'm pullin' up at 3
This car just ain't the same without you here next to me
All I wanna do is ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow, like a ghost

[Verse 1]
We been goin' back and forth, you think I only want sex
Of course I want it, look at you but that ain't my intentions
I've been tryna soak you up, maybe learn something
I said I would never chase but you keep on running
You know all of my ex's, you think I still do too
I just had to change my number but I'll never lose you
I just got back into town, I'm just tryna unwind
Let me ride around your mind

[Chorus]
I'm pullin' up at 3
This car just ain't the same without you here next to me
All I wanna do is ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow, like a ghost
Ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow, like a ghost

[Verse 2]
She got a kid, she ain't got a lotta free time
I tell her you need a lot more me time (yeah)
She got what everybody like
She's everybody's type (yeah, yeah)
I know that your man took flight (yeah, yeah)
I know that your money ain't right (yeah, yeah)
I saw you at your worst, still think you're the best
I'ma scoop you tonight (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm pullin' up at 3
This car just ain't the same without you here next to me
All I wanna do is ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow, like a ghost
Ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow (Ayy)
Ride slow, like a ghost
