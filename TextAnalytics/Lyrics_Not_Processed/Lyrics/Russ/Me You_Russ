[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, there's a difference
Oh yeah, there's a difference
Oh, yeah, there's a difference, yeah
There's a difference, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Me, got it out the mud, they respect that
Me, always spread the love when I get back
You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move
You, always complaining like a bitch do
Me, still right here with who I came with
Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit
You, got a different crew every weekend
You, don't want it that bad, keep sleeping

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you wished for it, me, I worked for it
Everyone passed on me like Kurt Warner
Search warrant needed, your career went missin'
This ain't overnight, this is year ten visions
Peers listen and they know that I'm up next
That's your girl? Why she do whatever Russ says?
Success is somethin' that I'm blessed with mentally (yeah)
I got plaques for my raps and my melodies
Can't forget about the beats too, I'm the best kept secret
Real shit or fake shit, pledge your allegiance
I was off for so long, now I'm on though
Bitch, I'm talkin', don't you interrupt this god flow
Thank you to anyone who ever slammed the door on me
Because of you, I did it myself, so it means more to me
Did so many free shows and now they can't afford the fee
No one gave a fuck and now the whole world's recordin' me, yeah

[Chorus]
Me, got it out the mud, they respect that
Me, always spread the love when I get back
You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move
You, always complaining like a bitch do
Me, still right here with who I came with
Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit
You, got a different crew every weekend
You, don't want it that bad, keep sleeping

[Verse 2]
Lately, I been tryna minimize all my stresses
Seven figures when they tax me, that's a blessin'
Diss me, I'ma diss you back on a hit song
PDs love me worldwide, you'll get shit on
Get it on your own or I can't respect it
See me in person, don't call, don't text it
Show a lot of love to my people, I don't post it
Y'all don't gotta know, just as long as they know it (yeah)
Despite your efforts, I'm here and I always will be
No rap name to hide behind, this the real me
Before the plaques, I was certified
I do business, I keep my income diversified
I counted 35 thousand with my family last night
And another 35 before this verse
I be layin' wide awake up in my thoughts at night like
"Goddamn, motherfucker, this worked"

[Chorus]
Me, got it out the mud, they respect that
Me, always spread the love when I get back
You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move
You, always complaining like a bitch do
Me, still right here with who I came with
Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit
You, got a new crew every weekend
You, don't want it that bad, keep sleeping
