[Intro]
Yeah, I been thinking a lot yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been way too long, since I seen you, looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and staying out, don't wanna say goodbye
Everything's so different now, you're just what I'm missing now
But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm trippin' now

[Chorus]
Sometimes I start missin' you crazy, ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps goin' and goin', I cannot forget you (no)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ride around town in a hoopty (uh)
Way before I ever had a groupie (uh)
Back when I used to wear the same five shirts
Way before I ever had Gucci (uh)
Way before I ever had a Rollie on
Talking back when I dropped Corleone
Picking up an eighth that my homie got
Fuckin' in the car, that's the only spot
Back when I felt more free, back when I smoked more weed
Back when I drove up and down 92, with a view of the moon and you in my passenger seat
That was so good, now it's all gone
It is what it is 'cause we both moved on
At least we, have memories, and we also got this song (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been way too long, since I seen you, looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and staying out, don't wanna say goodbye
Everything's so different now, you're just what I'm missin now
But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm trippin' now

[Chorus]
Sometimes I start missin' you crazy, ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps goin' and goin', I cannot forget you (no)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, if you saw me now
Would you recognize me or would you call me out?
I know it's been a while but I'm still me
But honestly it's been so long that I wouldn't be offended if you didn't even feel me
There's a gap now, big enough to make us forget how we felt in the past now
Everything moves so fast now, damn
I miss things going slower, I miss us being closer
I mean I got a good thing but I feel like I don't even really know her
This a new life, I didn't do you right
But I got a second chance to improve my appreciation, I should take it
I'm sorry that I ever got jaded, for real

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been way too long, since I seen you, looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and stayin' out, don't wanna say goodbye
Everything's so different now, youâ€™re just what I'm missin' now
But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm trippin' now

[Chorus]
Sometimes I start missin' you crazy, ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps goin' and goin', I cannot forget you (no)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
