[Verse 1]
Oh girl, wash your face 'fore you come to the table
Girl, know your place, be willing and able
Take it on the chin, let the best man win
Girl, shoulders back and stand up straight
Girl, watch your mouth and watch your weight
Mind your manners, smile for the camera

[Chorus]
And pose like a trophy on a shelf
Dream for everyone, but not yourself
I've heard of God the Son and God the Father
I'm still looking for a God for the daughters

[Verse 2]
Girl, don't be weak and don't be strong
Say what you want, just as long
As you nod your head with your lipstick on

[Chorus]
And pose like a trophy on a shelf
And dream for everyone, but not yourself
I've heard of God the Son and God the Father
I'm just looking for a God for the daughters

[Bridge]
I wash the dishes, feed the kids, and clean up all this mess
Do my best, forgive myself, and look good in this dress
Damn, I look good in this dress

[Chorus]
And pose like a trophy on a shelf
I'll dream for everyone, but not myself
I've heard of God the Son and God the Father
And damn, I love my son, I love my father
I'm just looking for a God for the daughters
I'm just looking for a God for the daughters

[Outro]
For the daughters
I'm just looking for a God
For the daughters, for the daughters
