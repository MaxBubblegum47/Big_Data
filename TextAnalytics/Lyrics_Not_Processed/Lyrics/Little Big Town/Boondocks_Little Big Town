[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

[Verse 1]
I can feel that
Muddy water runnin' through my veins
And I can hear that
Lullaby of the midnight train
And it sings to me and sounds familiar

[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

[Verse 2]
I can taste that honeysuckle
And it's still so sweet
When it grows wild
On the banks down at old Camp Creek
Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowin'

[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

[Bridge 1]
It's where I learned about livin'
It's where I learned about love
It's where I learned about workin' hard
And havin' a little was just enough
It's where I learned about Jesus
And knowin' where I stand
You can take it or leave it
This is me, this is who I am

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge 2]
Give me a tin roof, a front porch and a gravel road
And that is home to me, feels like home to me

[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

[Outro]
You get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday mornin'
You get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday mornin'
You get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday mornin'
You get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday mornin'
You get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday mornin'
You get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday mornin'
You get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole
Five card poker on Saturday night
Church on Sunday mornin'
