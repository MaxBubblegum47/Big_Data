[Verse 1: Ceza (Turkey)]
Sen kalk, bir minik mikrofonunu getir
Bak jak burada, diktafonuna tak
Kağıt, kalem bir de ilham alınacak
Tam gaz choppers, havada düşman avına çıkalım
Akalım, haydi bu battle'ı kazanalım

[Intro]
We started in the Midwest
Now we 'bout to take it all over the world, baby
This is the pinnacle, yeah, Tech N9ne

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne (Kansas City)]
Follow me all around the planet, I run the gamut on Sickology
They could never manage, we do damage with no apology
Pick 'em off the panic, a little manic, ‘cause I gotta be
Frantic, I’ma jam it, ‘cause I'm an oddity
Gobble the track up like I'm grubbin' at Mama Nakas
I can pop at you proper ‘cause I’m partners with Waka Flocka
Give me the top of hip-hop
And watch him make 'em rock
 
with a show-stopper
Chakras poppin' off the (Worldwide Choppers)
If you anybody, you notice it
Tech is the pinnacle, not an identical soul is it
Loaded, cold as the polar get
Wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo, it exploded, the flow, behold it, ‘cause when the motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a
, never to get free of the real
Better get just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Give me the knock and I’ma chop
He came and he went tomorrow
But I’ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas
Hit 'em up and get 'em up
I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trip when I rip it up
, I be the ish when I split 'em up
Sort of like I was liquored up and backin' up in the gut
Everybody be knowin' I be actin' up when I bust
From Missouri to Canada, I be keepin' the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man the planet's unanimous
Can I cuss? Fuck anybody! Tech is calamitous
Leave them in the dust ain't nobody tough when I'm standin' up
Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinkin' he give it the Poe and toss in Picasso
Killin' everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the coffin when I go

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

[Verse 3: J.L. (Kansas City)]
Check it, I'm ahead of 'em
Chop it up with the veterans
A legend developin'
Ain't gotta tell him it's evident
Gotta notice an elephant
None of you niggas relevant
You're delicate, but lovin' every second of this

[Verse 4: U$O (Denmark)]
De vil alle tjekke, når vi ligger det
Kommer ind og smækker det, beatet - jeg vækker det
I ved hva', der kommer ud af min mund
Hænger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om, vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle "vild fucking chopper"

[Verse 5: Yelawolf (Alabama)]
What if I ran into you with a pogo stick
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness
With a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more churches like I was playin' Hamlet
Syllable burnin', that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree like I was peelin' pecans
But instead I'm peelin' rappers' heads, makin' a sand-a-wich
Pick up a .22 and put a bullet inside of a
Motherfucka from inside a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make them feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
But I hopped on the fuckin' beat and I worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne, twist up the pine
And smoke a beat with Mr. Busta Rhymes? Well sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
With an alien probe

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

[Verse 6: Twista (Chicago)]
Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
And hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
And then I'ma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces
Of my enemies ‘cause of cannibalism
Breakin' them off into particles
They get in a predicament that be never reversible
‘Cause a nigga be too versatile, 
makin' you nervous
You could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then your respect I better have
Because I'm an anomaly, 
then I'ma give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challengin' my astronomy
Hoppin', I don’t stop with the fire when the flames thrown
I'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwin' it up in the air, takin' it there
We WWC, if you can't keep up shoulda stayed home
My alien knowledge be makin' other astronomers'
Work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology
So play me and I'ma be shinin' on them haters
I'm finna be usin' it as energy, watch how radiant I'ma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If I catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
Don't even try to stop us, ‘cause we choppers and we worldwide
And I'm—

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes (New York)]
See, now they ask when I'ma stop it, my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it and when I'ma drop it, my dude
Inevitably, it's that I'ma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask “What in the world is you provin'
When you were already the best?” and “What the hell is he doin'?”
Well, I'ma be choppin' and cuttin'
And breakin' and beatin' and shakin'
And fuckin' everything up 'til I make no further mistake and
Bustin' everything up 
like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
And shuttin' everything up, especially the ones who be hatin'
They lovin' everything until I got 'em stutterin' stupid
You hear 'em now? 
“D-d-d-d-don’t do-do-do-do it!
P-p-p-please, wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us?
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest”
And now I'ma come and kill 'em
Get 'em, hit 'em and finish 'em
And bang 'em in the head and diminish them
And then I'll hit 'em again at a minimum
Repeat it, comin' to killin' 'em
Then he be gotta be drillin' 'em
Thinkin', “They gotta be feelin' him!”
Spittin' lithium, see the way a nigga be spillin' 'em
And gettin' 'em stupid to the point where there's no forgivin' him
Hopin' you're listenin' and you're payin' attention
And you're witnessin' the way that I be christenin' in the mic
And gettin' in the zone, I be flattenin' and packin' in
People from the front to the back and
They got me actin' a fool,
 
I'm black and, nigga, now I’m home!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some, you can come bring it right here
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

[Verse 8: D-Loc (Kansas City)]
My fire annihilate make fighters retire instantly
I’m choppin' ‘em: call me Michael Myers in my vicinity
The way I be killin' 'em with rhythm, it get illegitimate
The Gilla will finish any in a predicament
Any enemies in the vicinity, I gotta mack up
They know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
The history of a lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals
Check my resume, they said the Gillgod’s biblical

[Verse 9: Twisted Insane (California)]
I hit 'em with venom when I get up in 'em
I bend 'em and send 'em and you can feel me
Diggin' up in your brain and bringin' the pain
They often wanna kill me
Fillin' 'em with that fury, get up and hurry
You can feel the real me
Comin' up with that shit, I'm havin' a fit
And you will never peel me
Off of you when I'm on top of you, I got the drop on you
And poppin' often, hit ‘em up with a bullet to the (brain)
You can look into the eyes of a heathen, breathin'
You’re fiendin' and dreamin' to find a demon, name insane
I’m a worldwide (Chopper)
