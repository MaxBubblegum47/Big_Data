[Verse 1]
Take your clothes and rip 'em, rip 'em off
Call these hoes and tip 'em, tip 'em off
You can tell them you are mine
I'm sick of, sick of games
No more time, you lit the, lit the flame

[Pre-Chorus]
We live in an age where everything is staged
Where all we do is fake our feelings
I've been scared to put myself so out there
Time is running out, yeah
Need to let you know, that—

[Chorus]
Last night I woke the fuck up
I realized I need you here
As desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Last night I woke the fuck up
I realized I need you here
As desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh

[Verse 2]
Take these walls and rip 'em, rip 'em down
Take my (uh) and snip 'em, snip 'em now
I will tell them "I am yours and very, very proud"
I am forced to give in, give in now, cause—

[Pre-Chorus]
We live in an age where everything is staged
Where all we do is fake our feelings
I've been scared to put myself so out there
Time is running out, yeah
Need to let you know, that—

[Chorus]
Last night I woke the fuck up
I realized I need you here
As desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Last night I woke the fuck up
I realized I need you here
As desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Last night I woke the fuck up
I realized I need you here
As desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Last night I woke the fuck up
I realized I need you here
As desperate as that sounds

[Pre-Chorus]
We live in an age where, everything is staged
And all we do is fake our feelings
I'm so scared to put myself so out there
Time is running out, yeah
Need to let you know, that

[Chorus]
Last night I woke the fuck up
I realized I need you here
As desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Last night I woke the fuck up
I realized I need you here
As desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Yeah-eh, eh..
