[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
Sleep on me, feel the rhythm in my chest, just breathe
I will stay so the lantern in your heart won't fade

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
The secrets you tell me, I'll take to my grave
There's bones in my closet, but you hang stuff anyway
And if you have nightmares, we'll dance on the bed
I know that you love me, love me
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
Kiss my lips, feel the rhythm of your heart and hips
I will pray so the castle that we've built won't cave

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
The secrets you tell me, I'll take to my grave
There's bones in my closet, but you hang stuff anyway
And if you have nightmares, we'll dance on the bed
I know that you love me, love me
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head

[Bridge: Jon Bellion & Travis Mendes]
You fill me up, you fill me up
You set my soul ablaze
You fill me up, you fill me up
Your love is so amazing
You fill me up, you fill me up
You set my soul ablaze
You fill me up even when I lose my head

[Chorus 2: Travis Mendes]
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head

[Outro: Jon Bellion & Travis Mendes]
You fill me up, you fill me up
You set my soul ablaze
You fill me up, you fill me up
Your love is so amazing
You fill me up, you fill me up
You set my soul ablaze
You fill me up even when I lose my head
