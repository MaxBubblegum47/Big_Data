I'd be jealous too, if she was with you
I'd be out of my mind, watching her move
If I was just a guy with across the room view
I'd be jealous too, if she was with you, with you

[Verse 1]
She laughs like she just broke into a hotel pool
She loves deserts and the sunsets out in Malibu
If you felt the way it feels the way she looks at you
I'd be jealous too, I'd be jealous too

[Chorus]
She's a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever wild smile appeal is like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they ain't ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Can't blame 'em if they want her like I do
I'd be jealous too, if she was with you
I'd be out my mind, watching her move
If I was just the guy with across the room view
I'd be jealous too, if she was with you

[Verse 2]
She comes on stronger than a bourbon street hand grenade
It's like you know her 'fore you even really know her name
If you could see her in the morning sleeping next to you
Just like I get to, I'd be jealous too

[Chorus]
She's a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever wild smile appeal is like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they ain't ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Can't blame 'em if they want her like I do
I'd be jealous, I'd be jealous
I'd be jealous too
I'd be jealous, I'd be jealous
I'd be jealous too

[Chorus]
She's a California red in a dive bar
Hourglass body like a guitar
That forever wild smile appeal is like a
Glitter bomb in the atmosphere
Eyes locked on her like a movie
Like they ain't ever seen a pair of blue jeans
Can't blame 'em if they want her like I do
I'd be jealous too, if she was with you
I'd be out my mind, watching her move
If I was just the guy with across the room view
I'd be jealous too, if she was with you, with you
