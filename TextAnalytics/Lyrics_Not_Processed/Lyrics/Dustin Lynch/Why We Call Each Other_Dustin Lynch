[Verse 1]
There you go lighting my phone up
But I know what you're wanting
Cause nobody likes a lonely at 2 in the morning
It's always been like this, our friends don't even know
It is what it is, keep it on the down low

[Chorus]
Cause we love how the fire feels
No strings, cause it isn't real
And you love the way I love the way you kiss
And we never wanna hold it on
It's just the right shade of wrong
But we know heavens at our fingertips
That's why we call each other
In the middle of the  middle of the night
We're so good under covers
That's why we call each other

[Verse 2]
Everytime you say you need me
It just feeds the habit
And you'll be gone by sunrise like it never happened
Girl you know I'm good, with just being your go to
So we'll keep on, keep on doing what we do, yeah

[Chorus]
Cause we love how the fire feels
No strings, cause it isn't real
And you love the way I love the way you kiss
And we never wanna hold it on
It's just the right shade of wrong
But we know heavens at our fingertips
That's why we call each other
In the middle of the  middle of the night
We're so good under covers
That's why we call each other

[Chorus]
Cause we love how the fire feels
No strings, cause it isn't real
And you love the way I love the way you kiss
And we never wanna hold it on
It's just the right shade of wrong
But we know heavens at our fingertips
That's why we call each other
In the middle of the  middle of the night
We're so good under covers
That's why we call each other
