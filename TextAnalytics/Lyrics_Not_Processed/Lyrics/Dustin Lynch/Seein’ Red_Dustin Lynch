[Verse 1]
Flame, girl you light it up
When I hear you say my name
Yeah, you know just how to start it
You shine, and I just can't wait
To get you out tonight
Yeah, you know how bad I want it

[Pre-Chorus]
Ride this Chevy like a Cadillac
With that one stop light, no looking back
Wherever we're going, gotta get there fast

[Chorus]
I'm talking red hot, red kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging off your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red, I'm seein' red

[Post-Chorus]
Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red

[Verse 2]
Damn, we can get down someplace
Just outside of town
I'll bring the bottle if you wanna
That moon, that moon ain't gonna tell on me and you
Just say the word and we're gonna

[Pre-Chorus]
Ride this Chevy like a Cadillac
With that one stop light, no looking back
Wherever we're going, gotta get there fast

[Chorus]
I'm talking red hot, red kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging off your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red, I'm seein' red

[Post-Chorus]
Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red

[Bridge]
No, I can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head

[Chorus]
I'm talking red hot, red kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging off your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red, I'm seein' red

[Post-Chorus]
Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red, I'm seein' red
I'm seein' red, red, red, red, red
