[TRACY]
You can't stop an avalanche as it races down the hill
You can try to stop the seasons, girl, but you know you never will
And you can try to stop my dancing feet, but I just cannot stand still
Cause the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round
And my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way

[TRACY/LINK]
Cause you can't stop the beat
Ever since this whole world began
A woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that I can today
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna, but I never ask why
And if you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say
That you can't stop the beat

[PENNY]
You can't stop the river as it rushes to the sea

[SEAWEED]
You can try to stop the hands of time, but you know it just can't be

[PENNY]
And if they try to stop us, Seaweed

[PENNY/SEAWEED]
I'll call the NAACP

[PENNY]
Cause the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round

[SEAWEED]
 
'Round and 'round
And my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound
 
Speed of sound, yeah
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way
 
 

[PENNY/SEAWEED]
Cause you can't stop the beat
Ever since we first saw the light
A man and woman liked to shake it on a Saturday night
So I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above
You can try to stop the paradise we're dreaming of
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay
Cause you can't stop the beat

[EDNA]
You can't stop my happiness, 'cause I like the way I am
And you just can't stop my knife and fork when I see a Christmas ham
So if you don't like the way I look, well, I just don't give a damn
 

[EDNA]
Cause the world
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round

[COMPANY]
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round
And my heart's
Keeping time to the speed of sound
 
Keeping time to the speed of sound
I was lost
'til I heard the drums, then I found my way
 
'Til I heard the drums, then I found my way
 

[EDNA/COMPANY]
Cause you can't stop the beat
Ever since this whole world began
A woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that I can today
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna, but I never ask why
And if you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye
And say

[EDNA]
That you can't stop the beat
 

[MOTORMOUTH]
Oh, oh, oh, you can't stop today  
 
As it comes speeding down the track

[COMPANY]
No
Ooh
Child, yesterday is history and it's never coming back
Cause
Child, yes-
 tomorrow is a  
Brand new day
Tomorrow
Brand new day
And it don't know white from black
 
 
Yeah
Cause the world  
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round
 
Keeps spinning 'round and 'round
And my heart's  
Keeping time to the speed of sound
 
Keeping time to the speed of sound
I was lost  
'til I heard the drums, then I found my way
 
'Til I heard the drums, then I found my way
 

[MOTORMOUTH/COMPANY]
Cause you can't stop the beat
Ever since we first saw the light
A man and woman liked to shake it on a Saturday night
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above
They can try to stop the paradise we're dreaming of
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay
Cause you can't stop the beat

[FULL COMPANY]
Ever since we first saw the sun
A man and woman liked to shake it when the day is done
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it and have some fun for today
You can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above
You can try to stop the paradise we're dreaming of
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay
You can't stop the beat
You can't stop the beat
You can't stop the beat
You can't stop the beat
You can't stop the beat
