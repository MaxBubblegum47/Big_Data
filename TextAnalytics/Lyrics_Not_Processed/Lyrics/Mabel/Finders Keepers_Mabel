[Intro: Kojo Funds]
Yeah
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Mabel, uh

[Verse 1: Kojo Funds 
with Mabel
]
Mama, don't run away
You know I got it, I know you want it
I'm a phone call away
You know you're on my mind
I know that you wanna stay
Let me take you to space
I can smell you from miles away
Wanna see you in lingerie
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You've got it, I want it
When I'm 
willing to put my all in
Wanna see you in 
the mornings
It should be me that 
you're callin'
You've got it, I want it
When I'm 
willing to put my all in
Wanna see you in the mornings
It should be me that you're callin'

[Chorus: Mabel]
Put your arms all around it
Take it now that you've found it
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers
Put your arms all around it
Take it now that you've found it
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers
It's finders keepers
It's finders keepers
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers

[Post-Chorus: Mabel]
I got what you want
If you trust me, the trust me
I got what you want
If you trust me, then trust me
I got what you want 'cause I got you

[Verse 2: Mabel]
I don't need miracles from ya
Stop going all digital on me
Don't feel like you need to try and love me
'Cause I don't need a spiritual journey

[Pre-Chorus: Mabel]
Boy, why you living in fear?
You don't live around here
Let's make use of the timing
These are the ends I stay
I don't plan on coming your way
Let's make use of the timing

[Chorus: Mabel]
Put your arms all around it
Take it now that you've found it
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers
Put your arms all around it
Take it now that you've found it
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers
It's finders keepers
It's finders keepers
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers

[Post-Chorus: Mabel]
I got what you want
If you trust me, then trust me
I got what you want
If you trust me, then trust me
I got what you want 'cause I got you

[Verse 3: Mabel]
I don't need miracles from ya (Ooh)
So let's keep the talk minimal (Ooh)
Is it criminal for me to want you right here, right now?
They say it's all chemical

[Pre-Chorus: Mabel]
Boy, why you living in fear?
You don't live around here
Let's make use of the timing
No I don't mind if you take me home
Didn't come here to leave on my own
Let's make use of the timing

[Chorus: Mabel]
Put your arms all around it
Take it now that you've found it
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers
Put your arms all around it
Take it now that you've found it
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers
It's finders keepers
It's finders keepers
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers

[Post-Chorus: Mabel]
I got what you want
If you trust me, then trust me
I got what you want
If you trust me, then trust me
I got what you want 'cause I got you

[Outro: Kojo Funds & 
Mabel
]
Yeah
It's you and me, you and me
So put your arms all around it, around it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, yeah, yeah
