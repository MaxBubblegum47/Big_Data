[Verse 1]
I've been looking for somebody
Tryna kick it with somebody
I need a rude boy to tell me something sweet
Same time, got his hands up on my body
I wanna get high when he take it low low
Make me feel strong when I'm taking control
I've been looking for my shawty
So come and get it if you got it

[Pre-Chorus]
All my girls 'round the world
I know you know what I mean
I get a little sexy when I'm lonely
One thing on my mind, I know what I need
All my girls 'round the world
Hands up and sing it with me
'Cause everything I got, you know it's all me
Even though a man ain't something I need

[Chorus]
I want a boyfriend, so put it on me
I'm looking for a man who can take that heat
Want a boyfriend, but not too sweet
My baby gotta be tough while he running that street
Is he ride or die?
I've been looking so long for a guy to turn me on
I want a boyfriend, yeah yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Where you at, where you at?

Want you better, love me better

And don't you know it's now or never?
