[Verse 1]
Wake up with a knot in my chest
Tried everything just to get out of bed
It ain't working, it ain't working
Sometimes, I can get like this
I cover it up with a smile on my face
But I'm hurting, I'm still hurting

[Pre-Chorus]
There are days when the world gets heavy
Sleepless nights, I've had way too many
When it's late and no one's around, around
Alone in my room and the tears start pouring
Wishing the night was still the morning
But tonight, I'ma let them fall down, fall down

[Chorus]
'Cause it's okay not to be okay
It's okay if you feel the pain
Don't gotta wipe your tears away
Tomorrow's another day
It's okay not to be okay
It's fine, you're allowed to break
As long as you know, as long as you know
Everything's gonna be okay
Okay, okay
As long as you know, as long as you know
Everything's gonna be okay
Okay

[Verse 2]
Look at you, look at me
We all going through it if you look beyond the surface
Beyond the surface
So what do I do?
Just wear it on my sleeve
Maybe then, maybe then you'd believe that I'm hurting (That I'm hurting)
That I'm hurting, mmm
 (That I'm hurting)

[Pre-Chorus]
There are days when the world gets heavy
Sleepless nights, I've had way too many
And it feels like there's no way out, way out (There's no way out, no)
Alone in my room and the tears start pouring
Wishing the night was still the morning
But tonight, I'ma let them fall down, fall down

[Chorus]
'Cause it's okay not to be okay
It's okay if you feel the pain
Don't gotta wipe your tears away
Tomorrow's another day
It's okay not to be okay
It's fine, you're allowed to break (Oh-oh)
As long as you know, as long as you know
Everything's gonna be okay (Everything's gonna be okay)
Okay

[Post-Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know
It's not easy
But you know, you know, you know, you know
That it gets easier
I know, I know, I know, I know (No)
It's not easy (Mmm)
But you know, you know, you know, you know
That it gets easier

[Chorus]
'Cause it's okay not to be okay
It's okay if you feel the pain
Don't gotta wipe your tears away
Tomorrow's another day
It's okay not to be okay
It's fine, you're allowed to break
As long as you know, as long as you know
Everything's gonna be okay
Okay
(It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be)
Okay
(Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be)
As long as you know, as long as you know
(It's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be okay
Everything's gonna be okay)
'Cause it's okay not to be okay
It's fine, you're allowed to break (Allowed to break)
As long as you know, as long as you know
Everything's gonna be okay

[Post-Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know (Oh no)
It's not easy (No)
But you know, you know, you know, you know
That it gets easier
I know, I know, I know, I know
It's not easy (I want you to know)
But you know, you know, you know, you know
That it gets easier
