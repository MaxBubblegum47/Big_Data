[Verse 1]
You can't keep your feet on the ground
Your head's in the sky, just so you can look down
But you never notice and I keep on hoping
I get what the joke is
I stay wide awake while you're asleep
Hold everything down just so you can find peace
I know you deserve it, I hope it was worth it
'Cause you got me hurting

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't call me anymore
'Cause you're scare of what to say
I'm hearing rumors through the walls
About the way you misbehave
You don't wanna let me know
But I'm with you anyway
I'm with you anyway

[Chorus]
And we grow, yeah, we grow
We're growing like Ivy, growing like Ivy
And we grow, yeah, we grow
We're growing like Ivy, growing like Ivy

[Verse 2]
A half way moment we live
I can't forget by can always forgive
You need to tell me
Why can't I just say?
Why can't we just be?

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't call me anymore
'Cause you're scare of what to say
I'm hearing rumors through the walls
About the way you misbehave
You don't wanna let me know
But I'm with you anyway
I'm with you anyway

[Chorus]
And we grow, yeah, we grow
We're growing like Ivy, growing like Ivy
And we grow, yeah, we grow
We're growing like Ivy, growing like Ivy

[Bridge]
I'm a part of you, because you're a part of me
Yeah, no matter what we do, babe
We'll keep on growing like Ivy, growing like Ivy
I'm a part of you, because you're a part of me
Yeah, no matter what we do, babe
We'll keep on growing like Ivy, growing like Ivy

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
We're growing like Ivy
