[Verse 1]
Does she love me?
She stands above me, in all her grace
I've been reaching for a spark in this fire in her heart
Does she love me?
Is it too late?
Is it too late to stop the flood?
It's already opened up something, I don't want to stop
Does she love me?

[Chorus]
'Cause you are the blood that I bleed
We've got the whole world under our feet
But, when you're tired and you're falling asleep
I don't wanna let go
I don't wanna let go

[Verse 2]
It creeps in slowly
Stings like poison through my veins
So many questions
So many glances unexplained

[Chorus]
'Cause you are the blood that I bleed
We've got the whole world under our feet
But, when you're tired and you're falling asleep
I don't wanna let go

[Bridge]
It's the freedom of falling, it's the way that you smile
It's just a flicker of something that's saying goodbye
It's the thought of tomorrow and the hope it would bring
It's relying on comfort and the way that it stings

[Chorus]
'Cause you are the blood that I bleed
We've got the whole world under our feet
But, when you're tired and you're falling asleep
I don't wanna let go
'Cause you steal the air that I need
And when you're near me, it gets hard to breathe
But, when you're tired and you're falling asleep
I don't wanna let go
I don't wanna let go
