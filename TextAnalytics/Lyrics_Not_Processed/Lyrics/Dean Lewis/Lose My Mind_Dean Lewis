[Verse 1]
I see you walking through the rain
And I see the water covering your teardrops on your face
And I know that I broke all your rules
And oh, now you're looking at me, and I'm looking at you like a fool
But, you don't know what it feels like to fall in love with you
No, you don't know what it's like when you can't go back

[Chorus]
'Cause I only lose my mind when I ain't got you
And how can I win when I'm always bound to lose
No, when I ain't got you
No-oh
No-no, I ain't got you
No-oh

[Verse 2]
So come on inside, you'll catch a cold
Oh, darling the storm will pass when we grow old
But you stand next to me with a look in your eyes
And you say goodbye, and you say goodbye
And you say goodbye
But, you don't know what it's like to lose you

[Chorus]
'Cause I only lose my mind when I ain't got you
And how can I win when I'm always bound to lose?
When I'm always bound to
'Cause I tried to hold on tight to make you mine, but I lost each time
And I only lose my mind when I ain't got you

[Bridge]
But I think it's time to let you go
To let your heart find a home
I need to let you go

[Chorus]
'Cause I only lose my mind when I ain't got you
And how can I win when I'm always bound to lose
No, I ain't got you
No-oh
No-no, I ain't got you
Oh-oh
