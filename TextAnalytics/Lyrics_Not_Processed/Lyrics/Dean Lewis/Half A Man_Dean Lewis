[Verse 1]
I was wrong to say I loved her, I was wrong to think I'm right
When I told her it was over, well my darling, I had lied
I've been running from my demons, afraid to look behind
I've been running from myself, afraid of what I'd find

[Chorus]
But how am I supposed to love you when I don't love who I am?
And how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning, so let go of my hand
Oh, how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?

[Verse 2]
And now I'm stuck in this hotel room by a cold neon light
And I've been waiting for an answer, but it won't come tonight
And every bottle I had stolen lay shattered on the floor
What's broken can't be whole anymore

[Chorus]
But how am I supposed to love you when I don't love who I am?
And how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning, so let go of my hand
Oh, how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?

[Bridge]
And no one can ever hurt me like I've hurt myself
'Cause I'm made out of stone and I'm beyond help
Don't give your heart to me

[Chorus]
But how am I supposed to love you when I don't love who I am?
And how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?
'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning, so let go of my hand
Oh, how can I give you all of me when I'm only half a man?

[Outro]
Hmm-mmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-mmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-mmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-mmm
