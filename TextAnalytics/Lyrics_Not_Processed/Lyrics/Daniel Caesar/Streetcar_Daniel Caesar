[Verse]
Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know

[Chorus]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there
All these street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there

[Post-Chorus]
In these streets
In these streets
I'm just not there in these streets
I'm just not there
Life just ain't fair

[Chorus]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there
All these street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there

[Post-Chorus]
In these streets
In these streets
I'm just not there in these streets
I'm just not there
Life just ain't fair

[Outro]
The good Lord gives
The good Lord taketh away
That's how it goes
I don't know what else to say
The good Lord gives
The good Lord taketh away
That's how it goes
Don't go live your life in vain
