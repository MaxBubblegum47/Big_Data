[Verse 1]
Everywhere that I go, everywhere that I be
If you were not surrounding me with your energy
I don't wanna be there, don't wanna be anywhere
Anyplace that I can't feel you, I just wanna be near you

[Chorus]
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
Will always need each other
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could, I swear I'd go back
Make everything all better, whoa

[Verse 2]
It's the things that you say
It's the way that you prey
Prey on my insecurities
I know you're feelin' me
I know sometimes I do wrong
But hear the words of this song
When I go, I don't stay gone for long
Don't know what's going on

[Chorus]
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
Will always need each other
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could, I swear I'd go back
Make everything all better, whoa

[Bridge]
And I'm coming back home to you
And I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home

[Chorus]
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
Will always need each other
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could, I swear I'll go back
Make everything all better, whoa
