[Intro]
Could you, could you say? "I love you Danny"
You want me to?
Could you?
I love you Danny

[Chorus]
If you love me, baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favorite
First you love me then you leave me in the basement
I know I'm your favorite
If you love me baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favorite
First you love me then you leave me on the pavement
I know I'm your favorite

[Verse]
I got this girl, she's making me crazy
I nearly let her have all my babies
Pussy so good, it sets me on fire
I leave myself, I elevate higher
You're fly girl, but you're headed to maybe
I'll take the time, treat you like a lady, yeah
My life's a spectacle, a sad story
Perhaps I'll find my way to the glory, yes

[Pre-Chorus]
Iâ€™m the one that took you to higher heights
That's what I was trying to do
I know you had your dreams of a better life
This time we ain't making it through

[Chorus]
If you love me, baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favorite
First you love me then you leave me in the basement
I know I'm your favorite
If you love me baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favorite
First you love me then you leave me on the pavement
I know I'm your favorite

[Bridge]
You're getting on a plane
And travelling far away
You've left me with a pain
I carry it everyday
Who do you think you are
Some kind of celebrity?
Just wait and see

[Outro]
I never asked for much only that you stay true
Need I remind you all the things I do for you?
Who can I blame, I played the game
Well just for now
I was wondering can you hold me down?
I was wondering can you hold me down?
