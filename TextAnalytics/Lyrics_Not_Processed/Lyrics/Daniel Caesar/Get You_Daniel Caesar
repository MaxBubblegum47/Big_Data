[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
Through drought and famine, natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be callin'
None of that could ever make me leave

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Every time I look into your eyes, I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside, I feel it

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
And when we're making love, uh
Your cries, they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need between those thighs

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Every time I look into your eyes, I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside, I feel it

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, babe
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?

[Verse 3: Kali Uchis]
And I'll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, it's all just memories
Now

[Bridge: Daniel Caesar]
(If you've got someone you like)
Don't you love when I come around
(Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take you down
(If you've got someone you like)
Don't you love when I come around
(Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I takeâ€”

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, babe
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?

[Outro: Kali Uchis]
This feels like summer
Boy, you make me feel so alive
Just be my lover
Boy, you'll lead me to paradise
