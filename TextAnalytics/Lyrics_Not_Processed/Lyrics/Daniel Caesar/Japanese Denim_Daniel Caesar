[Verse 1]
I don't stand in line, I don't pay for clubs, fuck that, yeah
But I'll wait for you
I don't like to drink, I don't like to think, fuck that, oh-ooo-oh
But I ponder you, ohh
I'm bending it over
You're my four leaf clover
I'm so in love, so in love
There's no one above up above
Forever's a long time, yes

[Chorus]
My blue jeans
Will last me all
My life, ohh yes
So should we
I'm spending all, yeah
This time, ooh

[Verse 2]
Met you at the shop, sun was getting hot, I'm lonely, yeah
(Lonely, yeah)
I'm in the city on my own (City on my own)
Never would've thought you'd be the one, I got a homie
(Ohh)
But that's the way it goes (That's the way it goes)
I'm reaching Nirvana (I'm reaching Nirvana)
Goodbye sweet Rwanda (Goodbye sweet Rwanda)
High school was never for me (High school was never for me)
Yeah, I say let it be, let it be
Forever's a long time, yeah

[Chorus]
My blue jeans
Will last me all
My life, ohh yes
So should we
I'm spending all
This time

[Outro]
You don't even know me
You don't even know me, yes
I'm hanging from the tree
I'm hanging from the tree
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
