[Verse 1]
I picked you up
I picked the place, I couldn't wait to show you off on my arm
I held the door, I held your hand
Even hung your jacket on the back of your chair at the bar
But I just remembered I forgot one thing
Never got that kiss before we got out the car

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I know the right way to treat a woman
When everybodys lookin' but I, I can't lie (no)
When you put your hand there on my knee
And get that look up in your eyes

[Chorus]
A crowded room don't mean a thing
And I don't mean to cause a scene
If you want to, we can leave but girl, right now
I don't care who sees (I was leanin' in for a kiss, I'm givin' in)
Even though it ain't like me

[Verse 2]
You see that couple on the right?
No they ain't thinkin' twice
'Cause all I'm thinkin' baby, why should we
'Cause everybody here can tell that I just can't help myself
If they could see the way you look at me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I know, yeah, the right way to treat a woman
When everybodys lookin' but I, I can't lie (no)
When you put your hand there on my knee
And get that look up in your eyes

[Chorus]
A crowded room don't mean a thing
And I don't mean to cause a scene
If you want to we can leave but girl, right now
I don't care who sees (I was leanin' in for a kiss, I'm givin' in)
Even though it ain't like me

[Bridge]
I don't care, I don't care
I ain't tryin' to spotlight
Yeah, all I'm sayin' is, we ain't gotta hide it

[Pre-Chorus]
But you know I know, yeah, the right way to treat a woman
When everybodys lookin' but I, I can't lie (no)
When you put your hand there on my knee
And get that look up in your eyes

[Chorus]
A crowded room don't mean a thing
And I don't mean to cause a scene
If you want to we can leave but girl, right now
I don't care who sees (I was leanin' in for a kiss, I'm givin' in)
(I was leanin' in for another kiss, I'm givin' in)

[Outro]
I don't care who sees
(I just wanna know if I'm comin' on, a little strong)
And Girl that's just between you and me, and I don't care who sees
