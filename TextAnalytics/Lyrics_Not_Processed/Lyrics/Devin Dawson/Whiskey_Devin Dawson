Leaves are fallin' in September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like whiskey, like whiskey
I never knew that love was blind
'Til I was hers, but she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
I let it burn, I let it burn, yeah
The feelin', it was bittersweet
Realizin' I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn, I had to learn, yeah
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Ooh
Leaves are fallin' in September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like whiskey, like whiskey
Ooh, like whiskey, ooh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin', I would've sold my soul for a little more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time
Ooh
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Leaves are fallin' in September

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom PÃ©rignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off with my heart, yeah
Leaves are fallin' in September
The night came in and made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like whiskey, like whiskey
And I was so young
'Til she kissed me
Like whiskey, like whiskey
