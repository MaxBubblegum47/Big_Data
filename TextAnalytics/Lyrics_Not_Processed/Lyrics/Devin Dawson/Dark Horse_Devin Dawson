[Verse 1]
People always ask why I wear black
Where'd I get my style and why I never smile in pictures
They ask me what I drink
I'll sip on anything but I'm a little more California smoke than liquor
No, it ain't that I'm self-conscious, I'm just conscious of myself

[Chorus]
I'll side with the outsiders
Those long-shot last-round fighters
Anyone who ain't afraid to stray off course
My heart bleeds for country music
Where the honest outlaw truth is
No, I ain't no white knight
I'm a little more
Dark horse

[Verse 2]
No, I don't go to church, can't quote a bible verse
I couldn't sing a song but that don't mean that I don't talk to Jesus
Girls say I push them off, that I can't open up
But I ain't afraid of love, when I say it I just want to mean it

[Chorus]
Yeah, I side with the outsiders
Those long-shot last-round fighters
Anyone who ain't afraid to stray off course
My heart bleeds for country music
Where the honest outlaw truth is
No, I ain't no white knight
I'm a little more
Dark horse

[Bridge]
No, it ain't that I'm self-conscious, I'm just conscious of myself
And I don't know how to be nobody else

[Chorus]
So I side with the outsiders
Those long-shot last-round fighters
Anyone who ain't afraid to stray off course
My heart bleeds for country music
Where my honest outlaw truth is
No, I ain't no white knight
I'm a little more
Dark horse
