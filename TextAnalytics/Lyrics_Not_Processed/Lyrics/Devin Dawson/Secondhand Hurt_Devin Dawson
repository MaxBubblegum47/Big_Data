[Verse 1]
It's been three months, since I lit one up
But I needed something on my lips to get me through
I didn't see this coming, when I let you go
I didn't think it'd be this hard
Getting over you

[Chorus]
If I was the one who called it quits
Why in the hell do I feel like this
If saying goodbye was for the best
Then tell me why am I such a goddamn mess
If I was the one who broke your heart
Why am I so torn apart
If I was the one who lit our love and let it burn
Why am I breathing in this secondhand hurt

[Verse 2]
If you hated me
Maybe then it wouldn't cut so deep
Maybe then I'd get some sleep
Knowing you were dying, crying
Nobody told me how hard it is to be the breaker
I've always only been the broken, the left-alonesome but
They both just feel the same

[Chorus]
If I was the one who called it quits
Why in the hell do I feel like this
If saying goodbye was for the best
Then tell me why am I such a goddamn mess
If I was the one who broke your heart
Why am I so torn apart
If I was the one who lit our love and let it burn
Why am I breathing in this secondhand hurt

[Bridge]
If you were the fool
I probably would've stayed with you
Would've waited for you and me
Guess the joke's on me
Cause I'm just left here wondering

[Chorus]
If I was the one who called it quits
Why in the hell do I feel like this
If saying goodbye was for the best
Then tell me why am I such a goddamn mess
If I was the one who broke your heart
Why am I so torn apart
If I was the one who lit our love and let it burn
Why am I breathing in this secondhand hurt

This secondhand hurt
