[Verse 1]
You can only go so long, running on fumes
Before the warning signs and the orange lights start turning on you
I don't need nobody's help
I can do it by myself

Only gets you so far
Before it starts weighing down on your heart
So here goes nothing, no

[Chorus]
Honest to God
I ain't been so honest to God
I'm falling apart
And I can't keep putting this off

I've been trying to deny You
But honestly if I was
Being honest to God
Honest to God

[Verse 2]
It don't makes sense
For me to keep dragging this on
'Cause truth be told
You probably gave me this song

With a whisper in my ears
I ain't listening I don't hear it
I just keep playing louder and louder
Yay-ay, even though that I know the power
When You speak right from Your heart!

[Chorus]
Honest to God
I ain't been so honest to God
I'm falling apart
And I can't keep putting this off

I've been trying to deny You
But honestly if I was
Being honest to God
Honest to God

[Bridge]
I'd say I'm not really sure
If this is it here down on Earth
Or if there's something more

[Outro]
Honest to God
Oh honest to God

[Instrumental]
