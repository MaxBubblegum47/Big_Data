[Verse 1]
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's fair
What a scene
Over men and horses, hoops and garters
Lastly through a hog’s head of real fire
In this way, Mr. K will challenge the world!

[Verse 2]
The celebrated Mr. K performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring
Don't be late
Messrs. K and H assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course, Henry the Horse dances the waltz

[Instrumental]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la

[Verse 3]
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H will demonstrate ten somersets he'll undertake
On solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight, Mr. Kite is topping the bill!
