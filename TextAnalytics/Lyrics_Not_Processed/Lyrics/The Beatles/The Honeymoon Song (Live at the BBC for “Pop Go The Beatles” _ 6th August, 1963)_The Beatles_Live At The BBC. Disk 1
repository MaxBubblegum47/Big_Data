I never knew that a day like today lay before us
I’ve got the sun in my heart and my heart’s in the sun
Skies are as bright as your eyes
The horizon is open
Love is the ceiling
Feelings are reeling
Free as the air
Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Who ever knew that we two could be free as we’d fancy?
Fancy is free
But are we who are bound to each other by love?
To each other by love
Who ever knew that we two could be free as we’d fancy?
Fancy is free
But are we who are bound to each other by love?
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
