You're a stranger in my arms
When i saw you standing there
Without a wooly ho i hair
You're a stranger in my arms
You're a stranger in my arms
I want it so much
And me on a road somewhere
You're a stranger in my arms
When the lights are very low
And the sky is on the celing
And there's no one there to know
Oh its gone off
