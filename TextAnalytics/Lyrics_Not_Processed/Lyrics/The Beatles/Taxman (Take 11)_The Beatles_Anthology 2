One, two, three, four
One, two... (One, two, three, four)

Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all

Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Verse 3]
If you drive a car, car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, walk, I'll tax your feet

[Bridge]
Taxman

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Verse 4]
Don't ask me what I want it for
(Anybody got a bit of money, anybody got a bit of money, anybody got a bit of money)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Anybody got a bit of money, anybody got a bit of money, anybody got a bit of money)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Verse 5]
Now my advice for those who die
(Taxman!)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
(Taxman!)

Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

And you're working for no one but me (Taxman!)
