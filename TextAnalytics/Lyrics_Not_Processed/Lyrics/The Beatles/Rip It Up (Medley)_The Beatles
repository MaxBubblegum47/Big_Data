I don't care if I spent my dough
Night gonna be
Gonna rock it up
Gonna shake it up
Gonna roll it up
Have 'em ball tonight
Rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul
Well get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said to my soul:
You're the devil in a frying pan
Well I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul
You can knock me down
Slap my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do
But oh oh honey
Lay off of them shoes
Now don't you step
On my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes
Ah go!
You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar
Do anything
That you want to do
But ah ah honey
Lay off of them shoes
And don't you step
On my blue suede shoes, please
Well you can do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes
Ah go, hit it, Carl [Perkins]!
Well blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Yeah blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Babe blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Yeah brown brown
Brown suede boots
Well do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes
