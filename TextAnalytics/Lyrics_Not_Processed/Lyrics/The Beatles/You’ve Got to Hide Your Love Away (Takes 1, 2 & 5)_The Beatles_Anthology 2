One, two, three, one, two, three
Hold on, hold on
I was off on that one
Alright, I'm just gonna raise this so it's near the bass strings and the top string

Paul's broken a glass, broken a glass
Paul's broken a glass, a glass, a glass, he's broke today

Okay, one, oh, you ready?
Okay, one, two, three, one, two, three

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
