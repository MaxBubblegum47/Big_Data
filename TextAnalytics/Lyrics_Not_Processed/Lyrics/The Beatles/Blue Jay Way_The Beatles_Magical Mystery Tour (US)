[Verse 1]
There's a fog upon L.A
And my friends have lost their way
"We'll be over soon", they said
Now they've lost themselves instead

[Chorus]
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
For I may be asleep

[Verse 2]
Well, it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

[Chorus]
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
For I may be asleep

[Verse 3]
Now it's past my bed I know (Know)
And I'd really like to go (Go)
Soon will be the break of day (Day)
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way (Way)

[Chorus]
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
Or I may be asleep
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long

[Outro]
Don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long
