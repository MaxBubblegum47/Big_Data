[Verse 1]
Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home

[Chorus]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2]
Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home

[Chorus]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 3]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 4]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
