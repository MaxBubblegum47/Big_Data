You Never Give Me Your Money

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any job, I got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go

But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

[Outro]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to...

Sun King

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king

[Verse 1]
Everybody is laughing
Everybody is happy

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun king

[Verse 2]
Quando para mucho mi amore de felice coraz√≥n
Mundo paparazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que canite carousel

Mean Mr. Mustard

[Verse 1]
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

[Verse 2]
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Her Majesty

[Verse]
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah
Someday I'm going to make her mine

Polythene Pam

[Verse 1]
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes "The News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
(Yeah!) Great!
Fab!
Isn't that great?
It's real good, that
Real good
Listen to that, Mal
Oh look out! It's-

She Came In Through the Bathroom Window

[Verse 1]
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

[Verse 2]
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah

Golden Slumbers

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse: Paul McCartney]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Carry That Weight

[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

The End

[Instrumental]
