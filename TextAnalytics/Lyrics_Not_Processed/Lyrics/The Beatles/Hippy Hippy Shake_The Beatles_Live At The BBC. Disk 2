[Verse 1]
For goodness sake
I got the hippy hippy shake
I've got to shake
Who the hippy hippy shake

[Verse 2]
Who I can't keep still
With the hippy hippy shake
I get my fill
With the hippy hippy shake
Ooh my baby
Oh the hippy hippy shake

[Chorus]
Well now you shake it to the left
Shake it to the right
Do the hippy shake shake
With all of you might

[Verse 3]
Then you shake
Who yes you shake
Ooh my baby
Ow the hippy hippy shake
Aah! Ow!

[Break]
Ow yeah! Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Then you shake
Who yes you shake
Ooh my baby
Who the hippy hippy shake
Ow the hippy hippy shake
Yea the hippy hippy shake oh yeah
