[Intro]
When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
'Til I get to the bottom, and I see you again!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Well, do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on, tell me the answer!
Well, you may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

[Chorus]
Now, Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Yeah
Woo!

[Verse 2]
Oh, will you, won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer!
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

[Chorus]
Look out!
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Ooh!

[Bridge]
Look out!
'Cause here she comes

[Intro]
When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom, and I see you again!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Well, do you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer!
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

[Chorus]
Look out!
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter

[Outro]
Well look out! Helter skelter!
She's coming down fast!
Yes, she is!
Yes, she is
Coming down fast
Oh, yeah, Helter Skelter
Wooh!

[Breakdown]

I got blisters on my fingers!
