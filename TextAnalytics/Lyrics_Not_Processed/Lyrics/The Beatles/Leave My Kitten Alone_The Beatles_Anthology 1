[Verse]
You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
But I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
This dog is going to get you
If you don't leave her alone

[Chorus]
Well, Mister Dog, I'm going to hit you
On the top of your head
That child is going to miss you
You're going to wish that you were dead
If you don't leave my kitten all alone
Well I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone

[Bridge]
Alright
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey hey

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah hey you better leave, you better leave
You better leave, yeah you better leave
You better leave, oh you got to leave
Hey hey, well I told you big fat bulldog
