Take three!
Have one yourself
Go on now, then
Take two? (Okay)

[Verse 1: Lennon]
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out, in

[Hook: Lennon]
Don't you know it's gonna be, all right
Don't you know it's gonna be, all right
Don't you know it's gonna be, all right

[Verse 2: Lennon]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're doing what we can
But when you want money
For people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait

[Hook: Lennon]
Don't you know it's gonna be, all right
Do you know it's gonna be, all right
Don't you know it's gonna be, all right

[Verse 3: Lennon]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free you mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow

[Hook: Lennon]
Don't you know it's gonna be-e-e, all right
Do you know it's gonna be, all right
Don't you know it's gonna be, all right

[Verse 4: Lennon]
