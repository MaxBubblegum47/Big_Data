[Verse 1]
I’ve got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I’m going to let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that

[Verse 2]
Well, it’s the second time I’ve caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it’s a sin
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that

[Bridge]
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

[Verse 3]
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!

[Guitar Solo]
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)

[Bridge]
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

[Verse 4]
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!
