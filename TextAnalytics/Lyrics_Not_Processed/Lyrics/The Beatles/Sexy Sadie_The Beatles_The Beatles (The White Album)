[Verse 1]
Sexy Sadie, what have you done?
You made a fool of everyone
You made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie, oh, what have you done?

Sexy Sadie, you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie, oh, you broke the rules

[Bridge 1]
One sunny day, the world was waiting for a lover (Sexy Sadie)
She came along to turn on everyone
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all (Sexy Sadie, she's the greatest)

[Verse 3]
Sexy Sadie, how did you know?
The world was waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you know?

[Verse 4]
Sexy Sadie, you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie, oh, you'll get yours yet

[Bridge 2]
We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
(Sexy Sadie)
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all

[Outro]
Ooh woo
She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie
