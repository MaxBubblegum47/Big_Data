[Chorus]
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Verse 1]
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back,
 she's dressed in black

[Chorus]
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Verse 2]
I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him

[Bridge]
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?

[Chorus]
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?

[Chorus]
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Verse 1]
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black

[Chorus]
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
