[Chorus 1]
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know that your love is all you've got
At times things are so fine, and at times they're not
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot

[Chorus 2]
A friend says that a love is never true
But you know this can't apply to you
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
And when she says she loves you, that means a lot

[Verse]
Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide what you feel
When it's real?

[Chorus 3]
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
But you know that your love is all you've got
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot

[Outro]
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
