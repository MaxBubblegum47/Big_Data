[Speech: George Martin]
"Strawberry Fields Forever", Take 7, remix from four-track Take 6

Two, three, four

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think, er, no, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
