Oh, ain't she sweet?
Well see her walking down that street
Yes I ask you very
Ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice?
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you, very hyperbolically
Ain't she nice?
Just cast an eye
In her direction
Oh me, oh my
Ain't that perfection?
Oh, ain't she nice?
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you, very confidentially
Just cast an eye
In her direct
Oh me, oh my
Ain't that perfection?
Oh, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she sweet?
Well I ask you, very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?
