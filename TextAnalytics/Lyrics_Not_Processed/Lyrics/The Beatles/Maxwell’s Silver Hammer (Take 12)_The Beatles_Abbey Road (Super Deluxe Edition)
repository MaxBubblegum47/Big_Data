Paul: Tell you what
Do, do more sort of a (scatters a drum solo) you know
Ringo mimics Paul
Paul: Yes, just something a bit more because it sounds a bit dead when you hear it, just as an intro
Paul continues to scatter
Paul: Yeah. Uh, do that one (Scatters and plays the piano to bass chords)
George attempts to mimic Paul

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures
Joa, oa, oa, oan?"

But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head, do do do do do
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be
So, o, o, o"

But as she turns her back on the boy
He [?] up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[singing]

[Verse 3]
*gibberish*
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Valerie
Gallery
Free
Agree and he tells him
So, o, o, o

But as his words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from the back

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead

[singing]

[Outro]

Paul: One more
It was good, you know, it had nice bits in it
It would be nice to have the nice bits and the other bits
George: And the bad bits
Paul: And the bad bits, yeah (Laughs)
Ringo: George Harrison is resting his arm
Paul: Let it be known unto the people [laughing]

George: Kick out the jams, take 8
Ringo: Brothers and sisters!
