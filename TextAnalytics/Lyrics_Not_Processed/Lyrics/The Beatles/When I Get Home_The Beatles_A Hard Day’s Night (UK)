[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

[Verse 1]
Come on, on my way
'Cause I'm-a going to see my baby today
I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say to her

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

[Verse 2]
Come on if you please
I've got no time for trivialities
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me tonight

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

[Bridge]
When I'm getting home tonight
I'm going to hold her tight
I'm going to love her till the cows come home
I bet I'll love her more
Till I walk out that door
Again

[Verse 3]
Come on, let me through
I've got so many things I've got to do
I've got no business being here with you
This way

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
