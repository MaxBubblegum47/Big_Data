[Intro: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

[Chorus 1: Paul McCartney]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

[Chorus 2: Paul McCartney and (Lennon, McCartney & Harrison)]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita maid! Ahh-ah-ah)
Rita!

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

[Chorus 3: Paul McCartney]
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you

[Outro: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison and (Paul McCartney)]
Lovely Rita meter maid (Lovely meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Oh Lovely Rita, meter meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
