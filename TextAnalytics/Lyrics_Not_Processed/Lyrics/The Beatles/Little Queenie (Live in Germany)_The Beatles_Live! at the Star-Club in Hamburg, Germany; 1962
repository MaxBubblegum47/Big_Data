[Intro: Paul McCartney]
Good evening, sir, how are you?

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I got lumps in my throat
When I saw her comin' down the aisle
I got the wiggles in my knees
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Yeah, she's lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Meanwhile, I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got the chance, I oughta take it
If she'll dance, then we can make it
Come on, Queenie, let's shake it

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Go, go, go, little Queenie
Go, go, go, little Queenie
I said, Go, go, go, little Queenie
Ahh, go, go, go, go!

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Well, there she is a-dancin'
Over by the record machine
Lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
Yeah, she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Meanwhile, well, she's thinkin'
If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
If it's a rocker, I'm gonna get it
And if it's good, she'll admit it
Said, c'mon queenie, Ahh

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Queenie, Go! Go, go, queenie
Go, go, go, little queenie
Go, go, go, little queenie
Ahh!

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Well, there she is a-dancin'
Over by the record machine
Lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
Well, she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

[Pre-Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Meanwhile, I was still thinkin'
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got the chance, I oughta take it
If she'll dance, then we can make it
Come on, Queenie, let's shake it

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Ahh, Go! Go, go, Queenie
Go, go, go, little Queenie
Go, go, go, little Queenie
Ahh!
Qo, Queenie, go!
Go little Queenie!
Go, go, go, little Queenie!
