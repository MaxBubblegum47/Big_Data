[Intro]
Ooh! My soul

[Chorus]
Well baby baby baby baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey honey honey honey
Said get off of that money
Love love love love
Ooh! My soul

[Verse]
Well give me give me give me give me give me
Give me all the love you got
Baby baby baby baby
Don't you know I want a lot
Love love love love
Ooh! My soul

[Chorus] [x2]
