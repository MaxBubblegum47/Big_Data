[Verse]
We said that our love was just fun
The day that our friendship begun
Well theres no blue moon that I can see
Theres ever been in history

Because our love was just fun

[Verse]
We said that our love was just fun
The day that our friendship begun
Well theres no blue moon that I can see
Theres ever been in history

Because our love was just fun
Just Fun, Just Fun, Just Fun...
