[Verse 1]
When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have heard enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away

[Chorus]
And you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Bridge]
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

[Verse 3]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Bridge]
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

[Verse 3]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Outro]
Ooooh oh la la-la
Ooooh oh la la-la
