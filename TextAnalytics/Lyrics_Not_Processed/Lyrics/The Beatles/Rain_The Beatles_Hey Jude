[Verse 1]
If the rain comes
They run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes
If the rain comes

When the sun shines
They slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down) And sip their lemonade
(When the sun shines down) When the sun shines
When the sun shines (Sun shines)

[Chorus]
Rain
I don't mind
Shine
The weather's fine

[Verse 2]
I can show you
That when it starts to rain
(When the rain comes down) Everything's the same
(When the rain comes down) I can show you
I can show you (Show you)

[Chorus]
Rain
I don't mind
Shine
The weather's fine

[Verse 3]
Can you hear me
That when it rains and shines
(When it rains and shines) It's just a state of mind
(When it rains and shines) Can you hear me
Can you hear me (Hear me)
