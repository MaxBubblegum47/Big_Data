[Chorus 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(Yeah, maybe you have to give him his own mic)
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 1]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Chorus 2]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Chorus 3]
I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps
