Wake up in the morning I don't feel blue
?Cause I know I got you
Get a funny feeling all day and night
I get the funny feeling you don't treat me right
Should have read your letters
And then I'd know
I would have felt much better
Because I know you love me so
Wake up in the morning I don't feel blue
?Cause I know I got you
Get a funny feeling all day and night
I get the funny feeling you don't treat me right
Should have read your letters
And then I'd know
I would have felt much better
Because I know you love me so
