Since we kissed I never knew the thrills I could have tasted
Since we kissed I never knew the years that I was wasting
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life?
Oh don't you know that until we touched I never knew the touch was of revealing
Until we touched I never knew my heart was really beating
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life
Oh where you've been, where you've been

[Solo]
Now don't you know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life
Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was feeling blue
Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was needing you
Oh where you've been, where you've been
Where you've been
Darling where have you been all my life
