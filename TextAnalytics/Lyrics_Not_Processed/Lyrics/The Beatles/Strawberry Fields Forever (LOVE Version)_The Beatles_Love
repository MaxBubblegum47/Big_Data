[Intro}
1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1: Demo}
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus: Take 1]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
{Verse 2: Take 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Chorus: Take 26]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3: Take 26]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
{Chorus: Final Version]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
