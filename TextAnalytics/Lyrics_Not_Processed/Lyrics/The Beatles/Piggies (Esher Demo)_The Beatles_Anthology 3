[Spoken]
One
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

[Verse 2]
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

[Bridge]
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

[Whistling]

[Verse 3]
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You will see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to cut their pork chops
