[Verse 1]
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo

[​​Interlude]​​
Go home

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo

[Electric Piano Solo: Billy Preston]

[Verse 2]
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta

[Guitar solo: John Lennon]
Hoo
Go home

[Chorus]
Oh, get back, yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Ooo

[Verse 3]
(Ooo, ow)
Get back, Loretta
Your mommy's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get back home, Loretta

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Oh, get back, get back
Get back, oh yeah
Jojo
