[Chorus 1]
Oh baby baby baby
Blues and sorrow
And I love you tomorrow
Just suit you just fine
Oh baby baby baby
Blues and sorrow
And I love you tomorrow
Just suit you just fine

[Chorus 2]
I can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
How must I forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes?

[Chorus 3]
You've broken my heart
Gonna do it again
And I can't forget
The spell that I'm in
Can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
I'm a-trying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
