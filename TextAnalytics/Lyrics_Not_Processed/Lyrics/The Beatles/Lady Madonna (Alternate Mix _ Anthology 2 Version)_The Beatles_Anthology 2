[Intro: Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

[Bridge 1: Paul McCartney]
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

[Bridge 2: Paul McCartney]

[Tenor Saxophone Solo: Ronnie Scott]
See how they run

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
See how they run

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

[Outro: Instrumental]
