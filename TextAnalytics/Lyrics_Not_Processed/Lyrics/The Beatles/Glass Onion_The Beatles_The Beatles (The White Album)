[Verse 1]
I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows

[Refrain]
Looking through the bent back tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 2]
I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul

[Refrain]
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 3]
I told you 'bout the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me

[Refrain]
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion
