Step inside love
Let me find you a place
Who cares of the day
Will be carried away
By the smile
On your face
We are together
Now and forever
Come my way
Step inside love
And stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay
You look tired love
Let me turn down the light
Come in out of the cold
Rest your head
On my shoulder
And love me tonight
I'll always be here
If you should need me
Night and day
Step inside love
And stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay
When you leave me say
You'll see me again
For I'll know in my heart
We will not be apart
And I'll miss you till them
We'll be together now
And forever
Come my way
Step inside love
And stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay
