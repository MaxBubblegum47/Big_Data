[Engineer] Good Night, take 22

[Paul] Are you picking up too much of us, or is it all right?

...

[Pre-Chorus]
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you

[Chorus 1]
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

[Pre-Chorus]
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you

[Chorus 2]
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight

[Pre-Chorus]
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you

[Bridge]
Mmmmmm, mmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmm

[Chorus 1]
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

[Pre-Chorus]
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you
