[Verse 1]
There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

[Verse 2]
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

[Bridge]
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and you

[Verse 3]
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

[Bridge]
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and you

[Verse 3]
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

[Outro]
Till there was you
