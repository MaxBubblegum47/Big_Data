In the night, there are sights to be seen
Stars like jewels on the crown of a Queen
But the only sight I wanna view
Is that wonderful picture of you
On a Streetcar, or in the caf√©
All of the evening, and most of the day
My mind is in a maze what can I do?
I still see that picture of you
It was last summer, I fell in love
My heart told me what to do
I saw you there on the crest of a hill
An' I took a little picture of you
Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you went my heart, my love and my life
I didn't know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you
Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you, went my heart, my love and my life
I didn't know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you
I'm left with a picture of, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you
