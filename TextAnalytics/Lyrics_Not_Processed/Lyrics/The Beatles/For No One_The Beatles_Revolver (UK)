[Verse 1]
Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

[Verse 2]
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

[Bridge]
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 3]
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[French Horn Solo]

[Bridge]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 4]
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him

[Verse 5]
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

[Bridge]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
