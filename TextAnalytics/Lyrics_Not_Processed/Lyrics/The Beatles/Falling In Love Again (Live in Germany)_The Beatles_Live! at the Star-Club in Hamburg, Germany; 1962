[Verse 1]
Falling in love again, for the love we share
As you hear me say, "I adore you"
I'm falling in love again, oh, my darling, it seems
Oh, my darling, it seems I love you

[Refrain]
All our romances would never go astray
My love is your love, forever and a day

[Verse 2]
Falling in love again, paradise, right here
I love that you're my dear, I love you

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Falling in love again, for the love we share
As you hear me say, "I adore you"
I'm falling in love again, paradise, right here
I love that you're my dear, I love you
