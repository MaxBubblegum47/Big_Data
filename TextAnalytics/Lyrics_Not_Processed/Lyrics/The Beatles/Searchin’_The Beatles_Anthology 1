[Chorus 1]
Going to find her, going to find her

[Chorus 2]
Well searching
Yeah I'm going to searching
Searching every which a-way yeah yeah
Oh lord I'm searching
Ny good lord, searching
You know honey
Searching every which a-way yeah yeah yeah
But I'm like that northwest Mountie
You know I'll bring her in some day

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]
Well Charlie Chan, Simon Smith
Got nothing, child, on me
Sgt. Friday, Peter Gunn
And ooo Alan B
No matter where she's hiding
She's going to see me coming
I'm going to walk right down that street
Like a Bulldog Drumming

[Chorus 2]
