[Verse 1]
Running to-and-fro, hard working at the mill
Never fail, in the mail, yeah come a rotten bill

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

[Verse 2]
Salesman talking to me, trying to run me up a creek
Says you can buy, go on try it
You can pay me next week, ahh!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

[Verse 3]
Blonde haired, good looking trying to get me hooked
Want me to marry, get a home
Settle down, write a book, ahh!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

[Verse 4]
Same thing every day getting up, going to school
No need for me complaining, my objection's overruled, ahh!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

[Verse 5]
Pay phone, something wrong, dime gone, will mail
I ought to sue the operator for telling me a tale, ahh!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

[Verse 6]
Been to Yokohama been fighting in the war
Army bunk, Army chow, Army clothes, Army car, ahh!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

[Verse 7]
Working in the filling station, too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the tires
Check the oil, a dollar gas, ahh!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
I don't want your botheration, get away, leave me be!
