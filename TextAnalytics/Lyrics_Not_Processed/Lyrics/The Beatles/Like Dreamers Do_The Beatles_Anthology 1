[Verse]
I, I saw a girl in my dreams
And so it seems that I will love her
Oh you, you are that girl in my dreams
And so it seems that I will love you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do

[Chorus]
And I
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you, you

[Hook]
You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I will love you
Oh I knew when you first said hello
That's how I know that I will love you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
