[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
You think you've lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say

[Refrain: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
But now she said she knows
You're not the hurting kind

[Refrain: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad, ooh

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you, too
Apologise to her

[Refrain: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
She loves you
And you know you should be glad, ooh

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
