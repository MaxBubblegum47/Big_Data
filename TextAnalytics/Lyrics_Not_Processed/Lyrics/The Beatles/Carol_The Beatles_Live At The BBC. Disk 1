[Chorus]
Oh Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

[Verse 1]
Well come into my machine
So we can move on out
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride
Well you take your car along
And you park it outside
A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, ma'am
Well every time you're going to drive
You find the joint is jammed

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well if you want to hear some music
Like the boys all play
Hold tight, tap your foot
Don't let it carry you away
Don't let the heat overcome you
Because they play so loud
While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd
Well you can dance
I know you will, you thought
I got my eyes on you baby
Because you dance so good
Don't let him
Steal your heart away
I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes you all night and day
