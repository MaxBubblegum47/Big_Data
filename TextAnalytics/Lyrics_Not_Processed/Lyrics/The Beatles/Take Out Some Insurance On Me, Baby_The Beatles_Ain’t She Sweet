If you leave me baby
I don't know what i'll do
I guess i would die, sweetheart
If i don't get a kiss from you

Take out some insurance on me baby
Take out some insurance on me baby
Well if you ever ever say goodbye
I'm gonna walk right back and die

Oh if you want me baby
You got to come to me
I'm just like a string feeling
You just can't lose me

Take out some insurance on me baby
Ooo some insurance on me baby
Well if you ever ever say goodbye
I'm gonna walk right over and die

Well if you want me baby
Mm you got to come to me
I'm just like a strong feeling
You just can't lose me

Take out some insurance on me baby
Mm some insurance on me baby
Well if you ever ever say goodbye
I'm gonna walk right over and die

Well if you leave me baby
I don't know what i'll do
I guess i would die, sweetheart
If i don't get a kiss from you

Take out some insurance on me baby
Ooo some goddamn insurance on me baby
If you ever ever say goodbye
I'm gonna walk right over and die
