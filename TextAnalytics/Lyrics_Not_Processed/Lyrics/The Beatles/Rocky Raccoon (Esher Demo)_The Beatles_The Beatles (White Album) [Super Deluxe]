[Chorus]
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
And everyone knew her as Nancy
She and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
Now, Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

[Outro]
...Two, three, four
One, two, three, four
Two, three, four, yeah
