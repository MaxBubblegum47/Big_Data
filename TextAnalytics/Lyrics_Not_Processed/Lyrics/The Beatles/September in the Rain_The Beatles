The leaves of brown
Came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The sun went out
Just like a light
Remember in September in the rain
To every word
Of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring
To me it's still September
Oh that September in the rain
To every word
Of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring
To me it's still September
Oh that September in the rain
I said I said it's September in the rain
Ah September in the rain
