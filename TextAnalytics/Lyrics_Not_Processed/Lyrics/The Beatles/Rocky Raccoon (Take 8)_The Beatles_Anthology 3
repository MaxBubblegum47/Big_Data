[SPOKEN]

He was a fool unto himself

Rocky Raccoon
Rocky Raccoon
He was a fool unto himself
And he would not swallow his foolish pride
Mind you, coming from a little town in Minnesota
It was not the kind of thing that a young guy did
When a fellow went and stole his chick away from him

[SUNG]

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
Said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

The doctor walked in sminking of gin (laugh) [Sminking?]
And proceeded to lie on the table
He's really sminking of gin
And it did him in the end [Poor doc.]

Meantime back on the table, yeah
The doctor said, "Rock, you met your match, son"
Rocky said, "it's only a scratch, son
I'll be better soon"
"You better be, better soon," said the doc
Come on son, gotta get hip
Gotta get up
Gotta get back to your gun
Gotta go shoot at, Danny Boy

However, Rocky Raccoon fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

Da da da da...
That's the story of the Rocky Raccoon


[SPOKEN]
Now Rocky Racoon
Got up from his room and he walked out through the swing doors of the local saloon
Straight into the arms of someone new
Someone who he'd known from a long way back
Maybe from his primary school days
A young friend Rocky recognized

[HALF-SPOKEN-HALF-SUNG]
He said, "honey, will you be my new honey-bunch"
She said "Rocky boy, come on, I'll show you why I love you."
"Young Rocky Racoon, I love the way you wear your hat
Love the way you hid your pants, Rocky Raccoon, I dig you"

He said, "missus, I dig you too, come with me"
