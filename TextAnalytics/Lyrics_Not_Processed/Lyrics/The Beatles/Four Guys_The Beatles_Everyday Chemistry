[Intro : John Lennon]
We were four guys, that, eh... I met Paul, said, d'y' wanna join me band, you know and then George joined and then Ringo joined. We were just a band that made it very, very big, That's all


[Chorus : Paul McCartney and George Harrison]
Long time ago when we was band on the run
Long time ago when we was band on the run
Band on the run
Long time ago when we was band on the run

[Paul McCartney]
If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away
To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day
If I ever get out of here
If we ever get out of here

[George Harrison]
Back when income tax was all we had
But its all over now baby blue

[Chorus : Paul McCartney and George Harrison]
Long time ago when we was band on the run
Long time ago when we was band on the run
Band on the run
Long time ago when we was band on the run

[George Harrison]
Take you away
Take you away

[Paul McCartney]
If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away
To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day
If I ever get out of here
If we ever get out of here

[George Harrison]
Back when income tax was all we had
And you've really got a hold me

[Outro : Paul McCartney and George Harrison]
Long time ago when we was band on the run
Long time ago when we was band on the run
Band on the run
Long time ago when we was band on the run
