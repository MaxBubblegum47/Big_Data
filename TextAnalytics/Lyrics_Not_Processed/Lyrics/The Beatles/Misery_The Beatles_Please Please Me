[Intro]
The world is treating me bad, misery

[Verse 1]
I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad, misery

[Verse 2]
I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag, misery

[Bridge]
I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

[Verse 3]
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

[Bridge]
I'll remember all the little things we've done
She’ll remember and she’ll miss her only one, lonely one

[Verse 3 - Outro]
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery (Oh oh oh)
In misery (Ooh ooh)
My misery (La la la la la la)
