I'm Pedro the fisherman
I fish by night and day
Unfortunately i live in Bristol
Far far away

And there ain't no fish to be caught
No fish to be caught
There ain't no sea
The council came
Away from me

I'm Pedro the fisherman
With not a fish to fash
I've got a hook on the line
A big mac, a big hat
Some socks, a pair of wellingtons
And a bit of wine
(A lot of wine)

So I'm going to go
