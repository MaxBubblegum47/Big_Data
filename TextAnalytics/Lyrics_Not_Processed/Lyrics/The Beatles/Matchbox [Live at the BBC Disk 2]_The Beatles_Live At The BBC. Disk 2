I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
Oh, sittin' watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches but I sure
Got a long way to go
Well, I'm an ole poor boy, and I
Ain't got a home
I'm an ole poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
And everything I do
Turns out mighty wrong
Alright, John!
Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please don't shake my tree
If you don't want Ringo's peaches, honey
Please don't mess around my tree
I got news for you baby
Leave me here in misery
Well, I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
Oh, I'm sittin' watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches but I sure
Got a long way to go
