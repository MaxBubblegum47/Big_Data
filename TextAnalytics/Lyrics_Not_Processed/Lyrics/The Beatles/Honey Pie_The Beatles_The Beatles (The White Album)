[Intro]
She was a working girl North of England way
Now she's hit the big time in the U.S.A
And if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say

[Verse 1]
Honey Pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

[Verse 2]
Oh, honey pie, my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

[Bridge 1]
You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

[Verse 3]
Oh, Honey Pie, you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me

[Instrumental Verse: Solo guitar John Lennon]
Ooh, yeah
I like it like that, oh ah

[Instrumental Verse: Ad lib Vocal]
I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me, Hollywood blues

[Bridge 2]
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?
Tee, tee, tee

[Verse 1]
Now Honey Pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

[Outro]
Ooh, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Honey Pie, Honey Pie
