One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hopin' every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

Can't you see when I'm holding you near
All the things I do
Show my love, and I'm making it clear
One and one is two

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hopin' every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

Can't you see I've loved you from the start?
Don't you love me too?
I love you, but you're breaking my heart
If you only knew

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hopin' every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

If you say that you're gonna be mine
Everything's alright
All the world would look so fine
If you'll be mine tonight

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?
I'm hoping every day
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"
