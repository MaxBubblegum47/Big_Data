[Verse 1]
I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on

[Bridge]
Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

[Verse 2]
Oh I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
Oh!

[Bridge]
Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

[Verse 2]
Oh I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name

[Outro]
I call your name
I call your name
Woo, I call your name
