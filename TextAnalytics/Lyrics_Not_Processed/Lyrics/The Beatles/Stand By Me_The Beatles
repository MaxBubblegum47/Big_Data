When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No I won't be afraid
No I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

[Chorus:]
So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Whenever you're in trouble would you stand by me?
Oh, stand by
Oh, stand by, oh stand, stand by me

[Chorus:]
