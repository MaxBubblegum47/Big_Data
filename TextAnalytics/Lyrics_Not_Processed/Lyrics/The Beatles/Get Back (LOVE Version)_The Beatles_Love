[Instrumental mash-up intro]

[Verse 1]
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo

[​​Interlude]​​
Go home

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo

[Electric Piano Solo: Billy Preston; Orchestra Swell: George Martin]
Go home

[Chorus]
Oh, get back, yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
