[Verse 1]
Please don't wake me up too late
Tomorrow comes, and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes tomorrow
I will leave and go away

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Songs that linger on my lips
Excite me now and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door
I leave them for the one who waits behind

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

[Scatting]

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

[Verse 3]
Far away my lover sings
A lonely song and calls me to his side
Where the sound of lonely drums
Invites me on, I must be by his side

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

[Outro]
Goodbye
Ah, ha, ha, ha
Bye, bye
