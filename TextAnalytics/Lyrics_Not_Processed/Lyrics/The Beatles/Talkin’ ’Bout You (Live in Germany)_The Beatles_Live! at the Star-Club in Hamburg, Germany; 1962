[Verse 1]
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I tell you, now, she looks so good
Got so nice skin and such a beautiful lip
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Come on, baby, it's you
I'm just tryna get a message to you

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I found her walking down an uptown street
She's so fine, you know I wish she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Yes, I do mean you
I'm just tryna get a message to you

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I tell you, now, she looks so good
Got so nice skin and such a beautiful lip
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Now, don't get me blue
I'm just tryna get a message to you
