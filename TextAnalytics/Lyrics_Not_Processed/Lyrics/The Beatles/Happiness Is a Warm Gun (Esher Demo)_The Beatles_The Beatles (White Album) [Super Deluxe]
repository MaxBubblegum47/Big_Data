[Verse 1]
I need a fix because I'm going down
Back to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix because I’m going down

[Verse 2]
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun

[Verse 3]
Yoko Ono, oh no
Yoko Ono, oh yes

[Verse 4]
I need a fix because I'm going down
Back to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix because I'm going down

[Outro]
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun?
Mother Superior jumped the gun?
Mother Superior—
Just, take one
Ooooooh
