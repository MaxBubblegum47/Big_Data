[Spoken]
Good night, take ten

[Verse 1]
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun puts out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream, dream)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream, dream)

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and Iâ€™ll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream, dream)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream, dream)

[Humming]

[Verse 1]
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun puts out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream, dream)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream, dream)

[Outro: Spoken]
I think I held a funny note
