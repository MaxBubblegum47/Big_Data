[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oh, she does
Yeah, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oh, she do me
Yes, she does

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past (Seeking past)

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
And from the first time that she really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Outro: John Lennon]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me let down
Can you dig it? Don't let me down
