[Verse 1: John Lennon]
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops gate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
Without Henry!

: 
Don't shout it out, though, John, just mouth it
John
: 
Well, alright
George Martin
: 
You'll hear it, though, I mean, it'll be on the bass
John
: 
Well, we'll have the massed Alberts on by then, won't we? Two, three, four
