Take 2
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
Do you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the ride
And I know, as I get, that I'll never get high
But I set to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast from miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer, dancer, dancer, dancer, dancer (yeah)

Helter skelter
Helter skelter

Aaowhoo!
Look out now
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
