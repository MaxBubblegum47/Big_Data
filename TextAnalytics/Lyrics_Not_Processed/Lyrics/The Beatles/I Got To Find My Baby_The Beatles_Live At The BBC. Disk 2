[Verse 1]
I'm gonna search this town
From door to door
Love I crave
I can't find no more

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

[Verse 2]
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

[Verse 3]
Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

[Verse 4]
Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever do in my life
I wanna find that little woman
Make her my wife

[Chorus]
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
