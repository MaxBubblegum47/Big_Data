[Intro]
Yesterday was today
The 29th of May
18 years of age
Thought I'd never see that day
Hol' up.. Wait
Suddenly, it's all starting to hit me
Why we have to go? I don't know
I guess just a part of life
And we all gotta grow
Old, 
Woah

[Hook]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they are here to stay
Oh I believe, in yesterday!
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they are here to stay
Oh I believe, in yesterday!

[Verse 1]
Loki
Highschool ruled, thought I'd never leave
So many memories, thinkin back It's killin' me!
So softy. Mommy please stop me
From maturing, I am in no hurry
Why am I so worried?
My futures kinda blurry
My feelings kinda mixed up
Like a mcflurry!
No words can explain
Just how I feel
Oh so much pain
The feelings so unreal
Life is but a game
It's time to spin the wheel
Do you feel the same?
Or is this no big deal?
Shit keeps gettin real!
Loki how ya feel?
Bittersweet
140 characters couldn't fit it in a tweet
I love the class of 13
Retweet!
All you underclass men hit favorite
Cause we just graduated..

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Class of thirteen
Up on the big screen
Ragers we threw were like a project x scene
We're just a bunch of teens
Who fein for untamed dreams
Cause reality, isn't what it seems
Life is too short
So I never hold a grudge
Were all very different doesn't mean you gotta judge
When push come to shove
It's all peace and love
No fight club
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now i need a place to hide away
Oh i believe in yesterday
Why she had to go i dont know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now i long for yesterday
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now im about to graduate
Hol' up...wait
Aye
Its the Graduation song

[Outro]
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Today is a gift
Thats why we call it the present
