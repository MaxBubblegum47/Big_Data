[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Steppin' in my big blue Chucks
Groovy Q, they all wanna fuck
Park the Cutlass at the pump
Hit the switches over speed bumps
Knocking six twelves in the trunk
Where the girls with the rump?
All the pretty bitches to the front
All you groupie niggas to the back
Put the 50s on the map
Got my Hoover star on the hat
Cause we groovin' like that
Yeah, we movin' like that
Swear to dick I shoulda made racks
Nigga, clean, dick in that cat
Got my Jimmy on strap
Like it when your booty get tapped (uh)
Why your jewelry ain't froze?
Why your money won't grow?
I move the pussy, can't fold (can't fold)
Bruh, you on the down low
Cause, work on Melrose (Melrose)
I'ma sling an elbow (elbow)
Get a job? Hell no!

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Woke and I’m already drunk
I’ma give these bitches what they want
Put this dick up in your rib
We could bring the party to the crib
Give them bitches dick to mouth and then doggy on the couch
Show her what this crip nigga 'bout
Nigga slanging D up in the drought
Before we bring the bitches out
Nigga west coast up in the house
Leave your trapping in the south
Bring the grooves to your feet
I could make a million every week
Bro this big body Benz ain’t cheap
Why them bitches want me?
Bro you want it low key
Shit I probably OD, I’ma live it up free
Judge, no I never couldn’t be
Everybody dance floor, what you got a man for?
Girl, I could do the pussy Rambo
Do I love her? Hell no
