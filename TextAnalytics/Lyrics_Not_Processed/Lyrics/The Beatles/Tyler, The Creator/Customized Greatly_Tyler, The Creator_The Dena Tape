[Verse 1]
Yeah, H-B
God said I'm great, thou shall not hate
So I love every body beefin' with me like steak
I chase after cake while your girl lick the icing, she go both ways, like she motorcyclin' haha
With out the motor, so she bicycle, taco in her mouth while she ride pickles
I kick push, nigga, my hodg' fickle, if you contemplate suicide, fuck it I'mma die with you
I'd rather eat glass than squeeze and pull the trigger
Call the competition and see who's the cooler nigga
I'm ice cold, similar to frozen
Got a nice flow, similar to golden
I'm like a gold fish, we are the same color
I'm just like your brother, or significant other
I work hard to provide grub on the table, turn impossible to possible if I'm able to

[Hook]
I must be dreaming, yeah, I said must be dreaming
(Why?)
I must be dreaming, heh, I must be dreaming
(Nigga wake up)

[Verse 2]
I just turned legal, and she must of turned evil
Life's a practice, so I'm on the court shootin' free throws
Cause when the game come, is when the rain come, when it rains it pours, I wonder when the fame come
I'mma be writing to an instrumental, different snare, same drum
Bang until I'm dry, and my brain's numb, yeah
Fuck a computer clap, I need snare
It sound like I'm smackin' on her ass while I'm pullin' on her hair haha
I don't think she like it, the way that she stare
But I continue with my program because I don't care. (fuck you)
I'm so damn tight, like a fat nigga in skinnys
Or a hoochie chick, with her skirt extra skimpy
Music is ren, motherfucka I'm stimpy
Pimpin' the game, never let the game pimp me
Like a pimps, we on 6th street?, tryna play the slot, if there's money involved, best believe I'm gonna take ya spot
Haha, damn

[Hook 2]
Damn, now?
And, for..
(Damn wake up nigga)
I must be dreamin'
(Wake up nigga, wake up, wake up)
(Hey)
I must be dreamin
(Hey nigga get up man)
(Wake up)
(Get up man!)

[Verse 3]
I'm Tarzan on the mic, Odd Future the gorrilas
Niggas do it for the fame, when I do it for the children
Taking over, running the game, like a fucking pilgrim
Knocking down the huts, and arranging for some buildings
Gripping the grain, get my grains ingrained
I chase dreams, I can't stop it, understand what you mean
I'm busy on the scene, while you tryna be seen
We all have addictions and I'm the type that feins, not the type that schemes and plays people like a Cello
The mellow, hella, ghetto, running free in the meadows
I picture me framed countin hundreds, in a falsetto
Instead of a chick opening up like, rose petals
I trust no one, sitting with my lonesome
No congo drums, Tyler kicked another sample
Beat is so hard that your motherfuckin amp blows
Hustlers on the corner, and The Lady and The Tramp knows
Nigga!

[Outro + Tyler, The Creator)
Forever, yeah
Hodgy Beats, Tyler the Creator
Yeah
Like, umm, G
You fuckin next man
You the golden boy in this rap shit
Don't let these motherfuckers tell you any different
Odd Future, bitch
