[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & 
Mac Miller
]
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em!
 (
I got it!
)
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em!
 (
Oh shit, oh shit
)
Girl, shake that body
 (
Oh shit, oh shit
)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Whoa, what do we have here? (Whoa)
People want to know how we could be that weird
How many hoes want to clean Mac's beard?
 (My beard)
I kill flows, think I need that tear on a tattoo
My bitch suck, she a vacuum (Let's go)
Fuck her in the ass every time I'm in a bad mood (Huh?)
Ain't got a choice, no, she do it cause she have to
I hit it raw while I'm listening to Papoose (Woo!)
No respect, 'cause you wear a v-neck (Go)
I mean stress, pressure that could even make Keith sweat (Woo!)
I wish Narnia was on a GPS
 (I wish)
I wish Rihanna was DTF
 (Man)
I got rich with these rap songs (Songs)
Bought a drug problem, now the cash gone
 (It's all gone)
Album filled with all sad songs
But this the one that I can laugh on
 (Ha ha)

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em!
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em!
Girl, shake that body

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Girl, shake that body, them ass and totties
I want to see them cankles at my hotel lobby (
No nigga, fuck you
)
Bitch, why you so damn snobby?
Your ass flatter than the back of my head
I bought you dinner, now it's time to pay me back with some head
Or I'ma have my little sister beat the back of your head
I'm a grade-A douchebag, I'm a dickhead
Asshole area where my gooch sag
Little momma got salty at me, she started talking tough
So I called the Wolf Gang up, they start to bark it up
Popped a hundred mollies, fifth of sherm, think I was sparking up
A bottle of Zima, the Bimmer, I started parking up
Seen my nigga, Mac, and he hopped in the back
And then we jet to Fatburger, ordered some Big Macs (Motherfucker)
And bitch came with a gauge, and she wanted my fade (Fuck you)
But I'm a bitch-ass nigga so I say

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em!
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em!
Girl, shake that body

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
T-Dollaz and Mac Meezy
Making sure you niggas don't win like referees
Looking for the bitches that love to suck peewee, Herman, I'm a vermin
And you could tell I golf with my hat, bitch, fuck Thurnis

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
Um, I'm at IHOP to eat with Tyler (Yum)
Drink cocoa then double-team Mariah
 (Let's do that)
But please, don't tell Nick
We were all watching movies at a Motel 6 (Okay)
Like ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
I hope Kendrick fucked Gaga
 (For real)
If Madonna on the Kabbalah
Then me and Snoop could chill and be Rastas
I don't need Prada to show you I'm rich
Pulling out the llama like, "Show me your tits"
Keep crying 'cause I still ain't over my bitch

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Oh well, it'll be okay
