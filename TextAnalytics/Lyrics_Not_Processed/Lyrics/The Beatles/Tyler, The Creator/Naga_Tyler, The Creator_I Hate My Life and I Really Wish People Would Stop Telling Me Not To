[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
She be like, yeah, I be like, nah
I be like, yeah, he be like, nah
I be like, yeah, she be like, nah
They'll be like, yeah, she be like, nah

[Verse 1: $ILKMONEY]
Fuckin' that bitch in the back of the Popeye's
I was tryna get some Five Guys (What else?)
Paint a nigga like some tie-dyes
Gettin' high, slingin' dimes when your cousin died (Uh)
I need a perm like Andre (Woo)
Then cut it off all to a bald fade (Let 'em know)
Stashin' bitches in my crawl space
What's in you wallet? Bitch, I work for Allstate (Okay)
Parlay, I need a mixed bitch like parfaits
Who read 
Junie B. Jones
 in fourth grade
With a big forehead like Shah Dey
She always give me free tickets to the Barclays
Shoot, net, swish
From the 3 point line, I sunk the bitch
Any closer, I might as well dunk the bitch

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
She be like, yeah, I be like, nah
I be like, yeah, he be like, nah
I be like, yeah, she be like, nah
They'll be like, yeah, she be like, nah

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, how are you doin', nice to know ya
Heard that I was from California
With the palm trees and the dirty water
And the nice things, that's why I go the hardest
'
Cause I never had it, had it, now I got it, got it
I'm a natural at it, need a cap and gown
'Cause I'm top of class, and I'm so sporadic
When I walk in rooms, motherfuckers panic
I'm a young man with a net worth
Young man, I'm a expert
I get neck like a stretched shirt (Da-na-na-na-now)
Bust quick, let this TEC squirt
It ain't not out yet like my best work, on God
Wolf Haley, the new baby, Luke Cage with an M-80
Lil' cool like Lupe
, they "touché"
When I say anything off top like toupée, T

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
She be like, yeah, I be like, nah (Shut the fuck up)
I be like, yeah, he be like, nah
I be like, yeah, she be like, nah
They'll be like, yeah, she be like, nah
