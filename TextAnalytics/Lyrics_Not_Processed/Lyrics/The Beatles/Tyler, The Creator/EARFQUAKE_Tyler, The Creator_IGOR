[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & Playboi Carti]
For real, for real this time

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
'Cause you make my earth quake
Oh, you make my earth quake
Riding around, your love be shakin’ me up
And it's making my heart break
'Cause you make my earth quake
Oh, you make my earth quake (Earthquake, ooh)
Riding around, your love be shakin’ me up
And it's making my heart break

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator & Charlie Wilson]
Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault (Girl)
’Cause when it all comes crashing down I’ll need you

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Charlie Wilson]
'Cause you make my earth quake
Oh, you make my earth quake
Riding around, you’re telling me something is bad
And it's making my heart break
'Cause you make my earth quake, oh, you make my earth quake
(Earth quake, yeah)
Riding around, your love be shakin' me up
And it’s making my heart break (You already know)
