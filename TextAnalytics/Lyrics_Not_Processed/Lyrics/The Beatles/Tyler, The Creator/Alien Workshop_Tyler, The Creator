[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Jesus, somebody call my shrink cause i think i'm about to have a fucking seizure
I forgot half this fucking verse, i'm guessing my brain have amnesia
Cause all my brain cells are living single like a deja
Rapping - stop it
Open - lock it
You niggas come short like fucking hobbits
I kidnapped a manager and robed it
I choked the motherfucker like batman and Robin
Then eat batskin and Robin
My girlfriend Islamic
Make it eat my pork fork spoon
In a room with pianos and balloons, i'l walk away with mushrooms
My girlfriend's a hippy
I bet i feed that motherfucker line like i'm Britney
You faggots are sissies
I'm shitty - y'all pissy
I run this shit, how the fuck you niggas skip me?
Even emo bitches want to slit me
I'm a bass drum - kick me
