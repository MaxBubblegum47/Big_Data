[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Fly with the birds in the wind
Where you wanna go, who, what, why, when? Uh
On a scale of nine to ten
You taking L's baby, hold my hand and feel like the wind, uh
Now fasten your seat belt, and turn everything off
I got your attention, motherfucker, I'm bout to take off
I'm the new pilot in this bitch
And I ain't bring no extra baggage for this trip
But I do bring a terror like I hate America
A brand new camera and a parachute
Nigga, you and I are not the same, we not parallel
Don't talk to me 'fore I fucking embarrass you
Now sit your ass down, you doing three much
I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up
Or you'll get fucked up

[Break]

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm so far ahead of you niggas, I'm in the future
Y'all don't even know about my existence, it's like I'm dead to you niggas
I'm saying (I'm saying I'm dead to y’all niggas)
Look, y'all be on the stupid shit
I'm the fucking pilot, your goal is to be the stewardess
I'm the fucking bomb like I was stuffing my shoe with it
The boy's a fucking problem like turbulence boy, get used to it
If anything happens, it's one door
'Cause if I see a building, motherfucker, we're done for
I'ma hit a couple of 'em up, this is parkour
Better call your family and give 'em your last wishes, nigga
And every line dirty, you thought that I dug ditches
But I never give a fuck, it's like I was born dickless

[Refrain: Tyler, the Creator]
I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Til' there's nothing left in the gas tank, I don't wanna crash
I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Til' there's nothing left in the gas tank, I don't wanna crash

(
I don't wanna crash
)
I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah, uh
(
And it's okay if I fall, I just wanna fly
)
'Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah, uh
(
The wind's getting high, I don't wanna crash
)
'Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah
(
And it's okay if I fall, I just wanna fly
)
It's kinda weird
(
The wind is getting high
)
'Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, look (Say what?)
(
Oh, yeah, yeah
)

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm tryna find a place, a place where I can land at
A place where I can be with no alphabet
Dictating where to stand at
You can buy a car, you can buy many things
You can buy happiness, but you can't buy wings
You can buy a parachute, you can buy a parrot
But you can't buy a pair of wings, aerodynamic
To stay cloud level
That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach (Fucked up)
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach
It's just crazy how you can have everything in the world, but
You in first class but you feel like coach, damn
That's why I'm in first class, but I feel like coach
