[Intro]
Once upon a time, there was a young man named
Hodgy Beats, OF, 
Super 3
, Yes

[Hodgy Beats]
I live for the money so I'm present in the Green-age
Mutant, like a turtle thats teenage
Look nice, but act ghetto without the clean fade
M-V-P me like D-Wade
I'm a shooter, like a computer for the internet
As if its intercourse, I'm just not in it yet
My house like a sauna, I'm always in a sweat
Every time she's in my bed, she always gettin' wet
I wouldn't cum in sex for physical intellect
Break your ass, then your back, then your neck
He's a gangsta, you ridin' with a roller
Wagon wheel, cabbage patch he pushing a stroller
Don't show holsters, unless he pullin' the toasters
Is that fish dead? Oh yes, he's a floater
Full of holes and I stay in rooms, full of hoes
Got Tyler lien to them all like Pinocchio, grow a nose

[Tyler]
Once upon a time, there was a boy that could rap
Rap, rap, let me talk my crap
(Go to sleep, Hodgy Beats)
