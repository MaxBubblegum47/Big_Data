[Verse: Hodgy Beats]
I don’t skate enough so why I got these Vans on my feet?
They maneuver like manure,
 
caravans on my feet
Intruder come in and shoot you going HAM is my beat
Haters clap it out I cut em’ by their hands and their feet
Cooler than Coleman Coolers getting higher then Luna’s
I Jiffy Lube ya…. Bitch up gave her a tuneup
I’m cartoon’d up, silly with the next scene
Sipping promethazine…. which is my best lean
Nigga ya best lean, is to lean back
And watch us blow green sacks on screen flats
Ok yo I get away like OJ yo
Fade away flow, oh, OJ Mayo

[Hook]
I’m Selfish I take everything
I’m creative I make everything
I switch it up the shits disgusting fuck disgusting
And Robitussin
, 
I’m the bacteria
Virus, hidden infected like I did

[Verse: Tyler The Creator]
Mary had a little lamb
Tyler had a couple wolves
Oval had a couple edges
Push me till the trigger pulled
Not ridiculous, I’m fucking incredible
I’m doper than a blue magic tablet, inedible
Peter pretty Bitch I popped her pussy, til my pickle split
Kitty juice on pocket slick
Button-ups is cheetah prints
I’m a fucking animal
It’s obvious I see the shit
You haul wack shit; it’s obvious you need a lift
Spitting like a loose tooth
Booth full of poofcorn
Satan meats and unicorn
With some extra two horns
Thrusts say El-Wolf logo, comprende
Supreme shit was good if you’re wondering how my day went
