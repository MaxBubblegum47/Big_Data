[Intro]
Say some more, never want to talk about it
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, November...

[Chorus]
Take me back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup

[Verse 1]
Ayo, What if Clancy fuckin' me over?
What if "Who Dat Boy" is rhetorical and this shit is over?
What if I'm hustling backwards?
What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes, fillin' his pockets?
And IRS show up asking me questions I couldn't answer
'Cause I was too busy tryna make classics
Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics
What if my music too weird for the masses?
And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
All my day-ones turn to three, fours 'cause of track seven
Fuck, what if I get stuck?
What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck-fifty
What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera
At them shitty apartments that's across from Bank of America?
Damn, I would be hurtin'
Writing all of these songs 'cause Wi-Fi wasn't working
Last year, in total, I put out two verses
But five-seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect
Oh, is it really? Oh, is it really? Bitch, you know the dealy
Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy, how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars, so what's their ultimatum?
Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the summer, '06, I remember the...
 
(

)
What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last? Let me pull over, quick

[Chorus]
And drive back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, what's up?
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup

My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day
My November, and I was performing and Lil Wayne rapped with me, I think I cried that night
My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film
My November was when I was gifted this Getz and Gilberto album
My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform
My November was... my brother took me to my first concert ever, which was to Kanye West's "Glow in the Dark..."
My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different
2014, Miami 43rd Street, every day was November

[Bridge]
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
I ain't doin' fine, lost my mothafuckin' mind
Time travel back and help me find
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back to November, this I kn—
"My November is right now"

[Verse 2]
I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending
'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance
The lyrics are—
Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback

[Outro]
Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone
