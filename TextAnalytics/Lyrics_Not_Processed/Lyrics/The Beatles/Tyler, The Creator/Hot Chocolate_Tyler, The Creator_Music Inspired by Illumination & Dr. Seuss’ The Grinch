[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
It's gettin' cold, chocolate
Too warm, chocolate
It's too hot (Hot), chocolate

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Leche for my (Woo!) damn self
Hot chocolate
You can use water
Hot chocolate
I prefer milk if it's 2%
Marshmallows on top and some extra whip
You can even use cinnamon, cinnamon on top
Hot chocolate

[Verse 2: Jerry Paper]
By the fire, I sip hot cocoa tonight
It makes me feel all right
It's Christmas time (Cocoa, cocoa)
Jigsaw puzzle with my buddies
Tonight is our big night
It's Christmas time (Cocoa, cocoa)

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertime
Cold that's my favorite, cold that's my favorite time
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertime
