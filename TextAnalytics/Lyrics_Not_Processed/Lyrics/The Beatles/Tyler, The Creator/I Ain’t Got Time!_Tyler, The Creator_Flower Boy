[Intro: Shane Powers]
Right now we got some new music only here on Golf Radio!
(God I love this sample)
We're going to dance
And exercise
And have some fun

[Chorus]
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time

[Verse 1]
Boy, I need a Kleenex
How I got this far? Boy, I can't believe it
That I got this car, so I take the scenic
Passenger a white boy, look like River Phoenix
First, happy birthday!
You bitch-ass nigga, yup I'm thirsty
Them little shots that you threw, they ain't hurt me
I ain't fuck with your bitch-ass in the first place

[Chorus]
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time

[Verse 2]
Nat Turner would be so proud of me
'Cause all these motherfuckers got they style from me
I bet they all looking from the crowd at me
And if I ask them, they would bow at me
But you're a house nigga, so you don't know
How that shit go, with my big lips and my big nose
And my big dick and my short hair
'Cause you already know how slow my shit grow

[Bridge]
(Hey)
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock

[Verse 3]
Been the man with a pickle plan, niggas know the dill
When I sell the carnival, I bet I get a 100 mil'
Next line will have 'em like "Whoa"
I've been kissing white boys since 2004
One me, two feet, three M's
Four, five, six years ago sucked
Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized
'Cause Vans fucked up
I'ma read commas, you gon' leave comments
Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'ma keep sporting
All smiles over here
Shout out to The Garden
(Tick-tock)
(And that's a fact boy!)
And I just handle all my business like a chessboard
(Tick tock, tick, tock)
And at them Golf boys? That's my motherfucking set, boy
Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar
Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola
Getting neck from abroad like some big shoulders
Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And the bread orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to (shhh) they gave a big loaf of
Green bread, got me chilling like a clean sofa
What's that thick odor?
Young Millie T
A young, focused black boy, oh silly me
(I ain't got time!)

[Verse 4]
Better talk shit
'Cause I'm either in my Cons or my Golf shit
Pants got a lil flood, nigga pipe down
I'm Lil Boosie, Lil Boosie, way I wipe down
(Boy I ain't got time!) Yeah, right now
'Cause niggas dying every day and I ain't light brown
And i-D ain't wanna give a nigga no post
So I went and did a 12-page spread in Vogue
(Nigga I ain't got time!)

[Outro]
Listen, man, I'm that boy
All you little niggas clones
Boy I fill that void
You better kill that noise
Turn around and remap route
When they see that boy with them big ears and that gap tooth
Tick, tock
Bitch
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Fuck, hello
