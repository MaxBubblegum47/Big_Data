[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Most niggas think I'm redundant
'Cause I like to take my shopping sprees out in London
I go to the can, I go shine in Japan
A diamond black card, I get as much I can, man
My seven chains seem so real
Imagination changed all the way that this feels
'Cause it's soft
Ice cream and ducks
My girl rock Louis Vuitton pumped you asked how much it cost
My nigga I go hard
I rock Goyard and Supreme, oh god
Thought I had to wear black just to kick Bush
Until a mechanic button pushed me just to kick push
Niggas know I'm a teenage millionaire
Got polos to match every color Care Bear
I get fit with Ralph Lauren, white tees is boring
That's why I rock the best, my nigga, get fresh

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm color-coordinated
Get fresh
They're not color-coordinated
They need to get fresh
We just color-coordinated
It's fresh
(Oooh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Burtono]
Yeah, all white polo, self-titled jeans
Filliano Burtono, dog, own everything
Your boy Filliano is OTC
And at it's worst, I shop out this country
Your boy Filliano got his own clothing
What's the name of it? It's named after me
You ain't gotta stay tuned, this ain't a cartoon
Somewhere far Mr. Burtono is coming soon
Red, white, blue, that's so fresh
Black on black, you look like a mess
The sunny part about it, I'm so funny
Yeah, I'm so fresh to death, I sweat money
I love it, chillin' in the public
Three hundred bucks for the Rockin' Republics
I don't know, but I'm not the best
I stay, I dress to impress, but just get fresh

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm color-coordinated
Get fresh
They're not color-coordinated
They need to get fresh
We just color-coordinated
It's fresh
(Oooh, yeah)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I go to Beverly Hills for perfection
Just so I can scope out the new Polo Hansen
My own clothing gives me an erection
I like to jack off to my own clothing
Nigga, check my wallet and see how much I'm holding
A new Bathing Ape t-shirt I'm unfolding
Cuff hands, block sip and attraction
With my jeans now I have a creative reaction
All my jeans get ripped up from my crew
Probably 'cause my new purple label look blue
Orange, yellow, green, pink, I got fits
My closet is thicker than silicone and Lil Kim tits
And as you can tell I'm on a mission
'Cause I got more True Religion than a Christian
I'm rockin' in public, but not in Republia
You rockin' Akadema jeans, I'm rockin' Rockin' Republic (Yup)
Paperweight O's on the check
T-shirt leaves weaves on the neck
My flow is sicker than Ace Babes just havin' sex
And you know what's next, I'm one of the best dressed
I'm not even gonna tell you the rest, my nigga, get, fresh
(Oooh, yeah)
