[Intro: Tyler]
Wolf Gang
Tyler, The Creator
Uh, fuckin' remix I guess

[Verse 1: Lykke Li]
Oh I beg you, can I follow?
Oh I ask you, why not always?
Be the ocean, where I unravel
Be my only, be the water where I'm wadin'

[Hook: Lykke Li]
You're my river runnin' high, run deep, run wild
I follow, I follow you, deep sea baby, I follow you
I follow, I follow you, dark doom honey, I follow you

[Verse 2: Lykke Li]
He a message, I'm the runner
He the rebel, I'm the daughter waitin' for you

[Hook: Lykke Li]
You're my river runnin' high, run deep, run wild
I follow, I follow you, deep sea baby, I follow you
I follow, I follow you, dark doom honey, I follow you

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Wait, you wanna fuckin' drown? Go ahead
Head first in that goddamn river, you're dead
I said that I loved you, heartbeats when you get near
So it's clear why I fucked you (I love you)
X's and O's, you must be the rose
Cause my exes are hoes, and where you gonna go
When you run through my head all day?
And I got a foot fetish, so I probably have sex with your toes
Um, life is a water park, could be fun
I'd swim in your ocean of love
If I had a life jacket cause I'm not that dumb
So next time I come, I'll bring you one
So you don't drown, when you decide to follow
And I'm gonna go deep cause you're not that shallow, right?

[Hook: Lykke Li]
You're my river runnin' high, run deep, run wild
I follow, I follow you, deep sea baby, I follow you
I follow, I follow you, dark doom honey, I follow you
