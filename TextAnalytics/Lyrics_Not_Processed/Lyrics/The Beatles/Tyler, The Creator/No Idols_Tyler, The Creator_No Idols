[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
Ladies and gentlemen, Wolf Haley and Domo Gen in this bitch
I mean the building, we came with planes and two Taliban kids
Some gasoline, me and Domo, we're two talented kids
Bitch, I'm back like my jump on Jimmy Fallon's ribs
Think I give a fuck? Axes get to hackin' at dicks
Then toss salads while you swallow you a gallon of jizz
Man this rap shit is borin', this tourin' is tearing me a new asshole
I'm not even enjoyin' the fruits of my labor
That's cause I'm up 'til four in the morning recording, fuck it
If you think I'm a dick, you bitch then why don't you, shove it
Up your fuckin' ass, 
I mastered this shit like I'm, Grudman
Cuban chain tucked cause you know I don't like, stuntin'
But since we're on the subject, I'm good bruh it's, nothin'
Lettuce in my pocket, salty niggas need to, catch up
You're full of bologna if you do not think my, bread's up
But let us get this cheese, you musta heard Rella
Never mind, you don't even like sandwiches fella
And I'm still fuckin' hungry, that's probably cause I'm African
Domo thanks for giving me the gift to wanna rap again
Actually, fuck this, Adult Swim pays good
Loiter Squad season two, bitch I wanna act again

[Break]
Uno, dos, tres, quatro (x8)

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Liftin' up like the collar of Kanye on College Dropout
To be honest, when I drop it I'm knockin' the whole block out
Off the glass, even when it look good I still box out
Bitch regardless, I'm the hardest, pullin' all of the stops out
Smellin' like success, leave the room I bet it linger
Word slinger, oh it's itchin' I'm fixin' the trigger finger
I don't get respect it's like somebody gotta die tonight
Type to hit my special five times in a title fight

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
Six in the morn, asthma flared and there's snot in my nose
The needle got me sick, whatever Robitussin will get it
I'mma dragon,
 I speak Portuguese and Spanish
I drive a wagon, momma said that I could be anything I imagine
I wanna be successful by the age of twenty-one
Cause twenty-three's too late, I'm done
I wool-knitted this purse and bullshitted this verse
But lucky enough the dick-riders will still go berserk
It's No Idols, nigga
Domo Genesis

[Switches back to the First Beat]

[Verse 4: Domo Genesis]
I got the game toe-touchin' like it's pigeon-toed
Put the homies on and flip it like reciprocals
Listen yo, quit the bitchin', why you timid?
I got this shit controlled, boy I be the illest feel it in my soul
For all you know I'm ultimate soldier type, it's a horror story
Reason you feelin' worried, cause I'm the poltergeist
I'm the evil thought that's approachin' 'em on the coldest nights
So when they ask me if I'm 'bout to kill 'em, tell 'em, "Show you're right"
I got my focus right as you could fuckin' see now
Plannin' for my spot, make you forget it like you senile
Document my awesomeness cause I don't like to freestyle
I like to hit the dougie while she suckin' on my penile
Domo Genesis, what I tell them bitches I'm finished with
Spit the sickest shit, don't put them tickets on your Christmas list
Get a glimpse of this probably make you go out and slit your wrists
Shit, watch these niggas just spaz on some schizophrenic shit
No Idols

[Outro]
Our boy Al, everybody's pal
