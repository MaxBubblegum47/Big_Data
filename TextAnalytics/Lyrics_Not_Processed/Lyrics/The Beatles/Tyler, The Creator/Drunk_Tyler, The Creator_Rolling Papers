[Verse 1: Domo]
Maybe it's all this smoke in me that's loking me got me thinking Ocean deep
Always want it close to me, I'm drifting in this potency
If you niggas cool, then ain't no one in here as cold as me
Domo Genesis, Hodgy Beats and Mike fucking G
Appropriately fucking beats, MP3's all in my sheets
Busting on the bitches wipe me down and put it on repeat
Hot shit like Mexicans sitting on toilet seats
And I'mma keep it G cause that is all I had a choice to be
Fuck lovers, play fight with rubbers
Wolf Gang I hunt her, then feed it to my brothers
Eat big for supper, scrape plates of butter
All to keep that green bouncinh in like Flubber
Sweet shit, we spit, these is, Reeses Pieces, sweet hit, we shit these bricks
We disrespect, fuck a beat, I'mma be sick, Domo G shit, fuck with me

[Hook]
I'm drunk, rolling through the interstate
Peddle to the metal on these bitches while they niggas hate
I'm buzzing, this is how it goes in my life
I've been on these niggas' hoes while you masturbate
I'm tipsy, wild as I want to be
About thirty feet deep daring any nigga to fuck with me
I'm fucked up, drinking of this beer all

[Verse 2]
I swear, last year they ain't know about Domo, bro
Now they all lined up for the Domo show
I dont need much give me beats and an ounce of dro
My main bitch, we just sit and watch the dollars grow
Like a hate plantation, and I just been waiting
For my season and watch them crops start flaking
If I'm awake then more than likely I am baking
Watch the world fall into my hands, I'm patient
I just got a dollar and a dream
I mean a wallet full of green and a pocket full of steam
And I been on the scene with the hardest of the teams
Me and my goals, ain't no stopping in between
I gotta keep it clean, I'm fly by any means
High in the air on a rocket, Yao Ming
Middle finger up, fuck what y'all think
Middle finger up, fuck what y'all think

[Hook]
I'm drunk, rolling through the interstate
Peddle to the metal on these bitches while they niggas hate
I'm buzzing, this is how it goes in my life
I've been on these niggas' hoes while you masturbate
I'm tipsy, wild as I want to be
About thirty feet deep daring any nigga to fuck with me
I'm fucked up, drinking of this beer all

[Verse 3: Mike G]
See we beyond def, so for respect O.F. will never need a pass
Far from the average, that the most will prolly see me as
I'm elevated, these niggas don't want to step up
I spit bullets see thats a real audio tech, huh?
But I ain't aiming, don't let it hit you
And have me looking for a place to put the bodies when I'm through
He bluffing, I might shoot, fuck it, I'm like you
Cause then again gun ain't the weapon I might choose
I'm a regulator, a hater decapitator
Just after sunset its murder on an elavator
So, be scared when you see them wolves mobbing
After all you prima donnas like Hoskins
Tromping, no lust, I give no warnings
Still ill, will, kill, I'm stomping
Hot boxes don't stop my nigga I gotta fight on
Rasta Mike G, I'm a lion, right on

[Outro: Hodgy]
I don't know 'bout what you heard about cash, but
My niggas get money, nigga get money
I don't know 'bout what you heard about ass, but
Domo Genesis got them honies, we got them honies
They up in the jeep smoking hydro
I'm like crazy bitch, she like I know
Yeah, homie we gon' ride slow
Odd Future, I shoot ya, die slow
