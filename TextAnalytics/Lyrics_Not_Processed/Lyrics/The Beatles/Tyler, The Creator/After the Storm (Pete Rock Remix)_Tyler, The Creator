[Intro: Bootsy Collins]
Ah, whatever goes around
Eventually comes back to you
So you gotta be careful, baby
And look both ways
Before you cross my mind

[Verse 1: Kali Uchis & Bootsy Collins]
Did you ever wonder, yeah, do you ever wonder?
What he might be going through on his own, and
The demons that he's facing alone (Sometimes it hurts baby)
I hate that sometimes I can't go home
And it just ain't the same on the phone, no
But everybody's gotta go on, don't they?
Yes, we do, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Kali Uchis & Bootsy Collins]
So if you need a hero (if you need a hero)
Just look in the mirror (just look in the mirror)
No one's gonna save you now
So you better save yourself
And everybody's hurting
Everybody's going through it
But you just can't give up now
'Cause you gotta save yourself
Yeah, gotta hang on, baby

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
The sun'll come out, nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough but winners don't quit
So don't you give up, the sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endlessly
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm's when the flowers bloom

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Kali, what you mean? I take it offensive
'Cause I'm the hottest flower boy
That popped up on the scene
Feeling better, better than ever
'Cause your umbrella, -brella (-brel-la)
Sun is beaming on me like headlights beaming on Bambi
Now let's pretend the street is the room
And you are a Camry, 'cause you drive me candy
The Tito to my Randy, now let's produce some thrillers
My chocolate wit' yo' vanilla, uh

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
The sun'll come out
Nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough
But winners don't quit
So don't you give up
The sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endless days
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm...

[Bridge: Kali Uchis]
I know it's hard
But did you even really try?
Maybe you could understand
When all you had to do was ask
And just open your mind
When everything is passing by
And all you had to do was try
Yeah, all you had to was try

[Outro: Bootsy Collins & Kali Uchis]
Try, try, try, try, try
And all you had to do was try
Try, try, try, try
