[Verse 1]
Chilling at the house on a couch with the box crayons and a line of cocaine
My nose is on fire like a button with propane, it's dripping all red of old gangs
And now you've seen your stars and your face numb like a funny bone cupping at ice
And your nose white like your head's covered in lice
But we both dazed, and I think I found my wife

[Hook]
Dazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm blown
Dazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm gone
Dazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm home



[Verse 2]
Chilling at the house on the couch, nose white
Mind is travelling, thoughts is mental
I'm trying to get into your pus just like a pimple
And I wait for the Cat in the Hat to pop through the window
The opium is in slow
Thin Though
Put My Brim Low
Let the lights dim low
