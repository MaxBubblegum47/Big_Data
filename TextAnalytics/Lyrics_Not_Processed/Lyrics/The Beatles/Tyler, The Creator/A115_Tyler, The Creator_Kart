[Chorus: Oliver Tree]
A-1-1-5
No motherfuckers left alive
A-1-1-5
None of them know how to thrive
A-1-1-5
All they do is group in hives
A-1-1-5
No motherfuckers left alive

[Verse 1: Oliver Tree]
I turn the lights off
Blowin' out the smoke with a cough-uh
When I hit the streets
They all fall down and retreat you beat
I can crack ya neck and make you do a back flip
White magic got me spittin' out a couple ad libs
Fuck, shit, fat lips
I'm pullin' out the clip
Broken legs, crack heads
Bitches let they legs spread
Get the bread, get the cred
Poppin' ass full of led

[Chorus: Oliver Tree]
A-1-1-5
No motherfuckers left alive
A-1-1-5
None of them know how to thrive
A-1-1-5
All they do is group in hives
A-1-1-5
No motherfuckers left alive

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Heyo, it's ya boy Tyler
I'm dropping rap bombs and cappin' like a liar
I'm a big man, risin' up with the trends
Who knew flowers and aliens could ever tie ends
This shit dangerous now
Gettin shot at and making guns go pow
Oliver brought scooter boys and let they glocks roll out
I wanna beat up yo ass up and hear ya scream and shout

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Oliver Tree]
Fuck you, fuck you, bitch lookin' ass
Fuck you, fuck you, bitch lookin' ass
Fuck you, fuck you, little punk ass
Fuck you, fuck you, little punk ass

[Chorus: Oliver Tree]
A-1-1-5
No motherfuckers left alive
A-1-1-5
None of them know how to thrive
A-1-1-5
All they do is group in hives
A-1-1-5
No motherfuckers left alive

[Outro: Oliver Tree]
(Ah, oh, eh, uh, eh, uh, oh woah, wah ah ah)
(Ah, oh, eh, uh, eh, uh, oh woah, wah ah ah)
