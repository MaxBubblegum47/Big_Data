[Intro: Devonté Hynes]
Follow that sea
Chase what you know
Cover your weave
Jump in the flow

[Verse 1: Tei Shi & Puff Daddy]
Yo, yeah, yo
Uh, uh, uh
Is this the way that you want it to end?
Is this the way that you leave me?
Already told you I don't wanna be friends
What's it gonna take for you to believe me?
Is this the way that you want it to end?
Is this the way that you leave me?
Is this the way that you wanna pretend?
Is this the way that you see me?

[Chorus: Tei Shi & Diddy]
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when you come around
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when I come around
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Is this the way that you leave me?
Yo, yo, yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when you come around, yeah

[Verse 2: Tei Shi]
What's it like where you are from?
Are you the star of your town?
Power up and make it your home
Apparitions of your love
Have you seen them falling short?

[Chorus: Tei Shi & Diddy]
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when you come around
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when you come around
Is this the way that you, way that you are?
Yeah, bring hope when you come around
Yeah, I still smile when you come around
Yeah, I bring hope, what
Is this the way that you leave me?
I bring hope, yeah
I bring hope, yeah
I bring hope, yeah
Bring hope when you come around

[Interlude: Puff Daddy & Tei Shi]
Yeah, gee, I don't, sometimes I ask myself, like
You know, what is it going to take for me not to be afraid
To be loved the way, like, I really wanna be loved?
But that I know how I really wanna be loved
But I'm, but I'm, like, scared to really, really feel that
You know, it's like you want something
But you don't know if you can handle it
I'll love again
You are the only one
You give me that hope that, um
I'll love again
Maybe one day I'll get over my fears and I'll receive
You'll be the only one
You'll be the only one

[Outro: Devonté Hynes & Tei Shi]
Follow that sea
Chase what you know
Cover your weave
Jump in the flow
Follow that sea
Chase what you know
You'll be the only one
Cover your weave
Jump in the flow
