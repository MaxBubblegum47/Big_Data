[Verse 1: Santigold]
Snow is falling, it's on the ground
First delayed but it's cancelled now
Late to the train broke myself off
Am I getting closer? Now am I getting closer?
Taking the streets, I'm moving slow
Sure made a sweat now, what's there to lose?
I just wanna get there before you go
I hope I'm getting closer
I hope I'm getting closer

[Chorus: Santigold]
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home

[Verse 2: Ryan Beatty & Tyler, the Creator]
I'll be there in the morning
I'll be there before you know it
Going fast as I can
But the traffic is bad
And my rental is slow
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming home
You on my team, I can't be alone
You hear that ring, I pick up the phone
Car, a plane, a walk, a train
No matter which way baby, I'm coming home
Wish that I could press fast forward
To the part where I get there
Seeing all the lights on

[Chorus: Santigold]
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Bar is low, texts slow
No goodbyes, no xo
My flight delay, no echo (Echo, echo, echo)
Hurry 'cause the plan's urgent
I'm trying to get home like the man's version
Emergency until I see you
And then you can hold mine like a hand surgeon
But let me take your bow off
Wooly knits, Prada hat so I can show off
You my gift that I can't get until I get to that front door
It's fluorescent if I leave with the lights on

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Yeah, leave the lights on
