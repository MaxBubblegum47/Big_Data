[Verse 1: Tyler]
Drip drop, the angels made a pit stop
Pissin' on the demons of the Earth
What’s it really worth? Shit, now it's fuckin' pourin'
Wanted to go skate, can't, now my day is borin', damn
Snorin' in the bed with blankets cause my head spin
Probably cause I popped a couple purple Excedrins
It's a rainy day, so I'll skip the Led Zeppelin
And play some Sade "Love Deluxe" through my headset
On my way home I punched a bitch for an umbrella
Why? Cause I really didn’t wanna get my shit wet
Run through the puddles, playin' in the mud
Fun, sucks that I'm too tall for the tub
Or I would get my toys and make a lotta noise
While my mom is in the kitchen cookin' up a meal
Fire place is startin' up, dick is barely warmin' up
Sippy cup full of whip creamed hot chocolate

[Hook: Pharrell]
I can smell it when I go outside
Then it just pours
It gives us peace then all in the town is quiet
That's what rain's for

[Bridge: Pharrell]
All the kids see rain and scream "No, no"
Run off the bus and they will just stay in
Me I love how rain fills the potholes
Me and my sailboat, that's what we played in
Ever wonder exactly where the sun goes
Did it go or did somethin' shade it?
The sun gives light cause it is the window
The rain gives life cause it is amazin'

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Lightning is striking, water hittin' on my window like Ike
I am not Tina, buddy, do not give my window pain
Lights bulbs when wearin' that wig, flyin' kites
Here's an idea, why don't I go hiking
On a fuckin' mountain where the water fountains icing
Stand there in a tank top prop that's from Baywatch
And eat about four bowls of some frozen ice cream
Get sick and then I won't have to
Go to school today, tomorrow, the day after
Sit in bed, write a bunch of raps up
And I won't be lyin' when I say I’m a sick rapper
I might fail so I won't bother
The sun is playin' hide and seek like my fuckin' father
The only difference is it comes back, full effect
In the summer heats up, the thermometers erected

[Outro: Pharrell]
The inside of clouds
That's the window into the sky
Proves there's life
