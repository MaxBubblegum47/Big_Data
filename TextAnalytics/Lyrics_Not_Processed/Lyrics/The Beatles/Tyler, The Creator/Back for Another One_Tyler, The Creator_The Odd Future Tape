[Intro]
The moment you've all been waiting for

[Verse 1: Casey]
Uh, say hello to the great one
Mixtapes for free homie, here take one
It might come in handy
A record deal was the best thing 
y'all can hand me
My squad, the new Grammy family
Uh, but they ain't feelin' it, oh well, more bars, I'm spillin' it
Every time I touch a mic they be like yo, your touch is tight
Y'all's focus I took slow shots, bash so hard and slow
Just like a robot, you not hot man
I'm sorry for the truth, Customized Greatly, killin' shit
Casey feels sorry in the booth, uh
Flow's so sweet they put fillings in my tooth, yeah
Fillings in my teeth,
 
Ace the Creator on the beat
Casey Veggies on the vocals got you niggas in a chokehold, uh oh
Yeah, yeah, he's at it again, spread the word tell your moms and your friend

Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)

[Verse 2]
The difference between me and them rappers
Is I wear clothes fresh out the wrapper
Undivided attention, the show's on
And no cancelled shit, it must go on
Nigga, volume two, uh, turn up the volume, too
I'm crazy lyrically, come get at me seriously
Niggas know I kill 'em mentally and spiritually
I hope you're hearin' me, uh
First mixtape was hot, I hope you fear me
Believe that, y'all niggas didn't believe that he rap
And now y'all bob your heads to the things that he rap
Uh, y'all niggas didn't believe that he rap and
Now y'all bob your heads to the things that he rap
This nigga hated and she clap, no handshakes leave daps

[Hook]
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)

[Verse 3: Tyler]
Damn, back for another one with robots
I'm so hot, you're cold, now here's a fucking sweater
Look, I can't have no other fun
With my pops probably cause he out with his other son
But, I'm super steezy like my last beat
My bitch super greezy like her lunch be granola bars
I spill healthy verses, call 'em granola bars
Now every bitch wanna eat her Casey Veggies with no salt
Now it's so crazy, other people than my moms is callin' me baby
My nigga get ya hopes down, you couldn't persuade me
To collaborate with you niggas, ya lyrics is lazy
I'm undefeated, but the suede shoes is Puma
I'm the cancer and the tumor with the drums and the tubas blastin'
I'm a crook and it's a castle
If I am the shit, then I'm guessin' my mom's a asshole (because I'm)

[Hook]
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one, back, back, back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)
