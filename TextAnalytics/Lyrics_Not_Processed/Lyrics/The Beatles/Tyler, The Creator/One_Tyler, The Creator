[Verse]
I'm in your room now your screaming for help
Anxiety attack so you piss on yourself
And you pray to god that one of your neighbors can help you
But that won't happen I'm helter skelter
In my lobby, they can't find me
I'm not a maniac, i'm a zombie
I'mma rap about some neo nazi
Bitch you better call on God or Gandhi
Better hope Jesus come baptize you
Because I'm about to come rape or sodomize you
Keep doing that until I realize you
Dead from the sound boom when I pound you
I'm a night stalker, catching bitches walking after dark in parks
Hit that corner, then they're gone
They can't call for help because I took their phone
Using up minutes, use them to call my homies just to tell them that I'm in it
Bitch I dare you to scream
Haven't you heard of Sarah? That's me
I made that bitch my 
milk tits
I was dressed up like Lisa Simpson
Put her to sleep, quick in my hilton
Now I'm bout to change your name to Ruth Wilson
Voices in my head like kill them
Amityville insanity pill
I can't swallow my cavities
They're strictly from these casualties, that's really good with ham and cheese
Load them up on Craigslist
My email address is:
How-you-doing-my-name-is-Tyler, and you're a dead bitch
(First)

[Hook]
(Aye, Aye, Aye,Aye)
Run bitch, run!
(Howl)
(I'm a motherfuckin' wolf)

[Outro]
You better run, bitch
