[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]
Mom told me not to ask for ish
Whenever we hit up the grocery store
So now, for the music, it's the same with an asterisk
Whenever they ask what I want from y'all
Always had a dream of the simple things
Put my mark on the game in a dimple way
Some put they mark on the game in a pimple way
'Cause videos nowadays look like pimp parades, but hip hip hooray
'Cause now they got a real artist on his way up
These niggas living the dream, they about to wake up
I got support from two dads, on some gay stuff
One live in Chi-town, the other live way up
Everything I do is dedication to them, my whole family
I ain't even asking for a Grammy
If I got one, I'd probably give it to my grammy
You understand me?
(That's all that I'm asking for)

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
My respect, a four-figure check every month for the rent
(That's all that I'm asking for)
A fake ID to get inside the bar in a mid-size car
(That's all I'm really asking for)
A best friend with a little bit of class and a girl who loves jazz
(That's all that I'm asking for)
To be internationally known so everywhere I go, I'm home
(That's all that I'm asking for)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
B, what's happening? Nigga, fuck rapping
I'm in cell 1 and 2 because I'm considering trapping
3 or 4 with some overweight groupies
And a food stamp nigga and a motherfucking hoopdy
But truthfully, I'm hungry, these rappers is lunchmeat
I laugh at AIDS victims, cold heart, fuck heat
Fuck school, do drugs, holes with no magnum, kill everyone in the industry
And drag them to the florist by the end of the chorus, so they can be alive in case
My fucking verse is boring, bass in the stairs
Stock shit like a share, I'm a virus
Having great dreams of fucking Miley Cyrus
Bitches, I bag them, jeans, I sag them
7, 8, y'all don't lay them straight, your nigga is fag them
9, 10, I'm a motherfucking sin
Turn this shit off before I say... Amen

[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]
My respect, a four-figure check every month for the rent
(That's all that I'm asking for)
A fake ID to get inside the bar in a mid-size car
(That's all I'm really asking for)
A best friend with a little bit of class and a girl who loves jazz
(That's all that I'm asking for)
To be internationally known so everywhere I go, I'm home
(That's all that I'm asking for)

[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]
What the heck I look like, trying to impress fishes?
There's plenty fish in the sea, and I love fishes
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
It's no secret, I love breasts, but I hate chickens
It's no secret, I love getting, but hate wishing
Hey, listen, I know you heard a lot of rappers
But there's a difference, I'm an emcee that's dapper
A little sex appeal 'cause I think sex is real fresh
But honestly, the music is the best
Only God comes before it like I before E, except after C
Well, you know what I mean
I just want you to see the big picture
A lot of dudes need help being cool like Kool-Aid, I'm a big pitcher
Trying to sell to a hypnotized world
What I gotta do, sing the Spice Girls?
Fine
(Ayo, tell them what you want, what you really, really want)
Ayo, I'll tell them what I want, what I really, really want
I want art, I want peace, I want sound, I want love
And what I really, really, really want to zigazig ha
(Ayo, tell them what you want, what you really, really want)
Ayo, I'll tell them what I want, what I really, really want
I want art, I want peace, I want sound, I want love
And what I really, really, really want to zigazig ha

16-Bit meets Odd Future
Yep
I mean, we really gotta stop meeting like this, Ty
I got you, my nigga
It's not even fair to the world
Come on, man, we just made a classic
From now until forever
Forever
