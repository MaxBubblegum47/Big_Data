[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
(Four, four, four, four)
(Four, skate, four, skate, four, skate, four, skate)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I don't know where I’m going (Skate)
But I know what I'm showing (Four)
Feelings, that's what I’m pouring (Skate)
What the fuck is your motive? (Four)
Man, I wish you would call me
 (Skate)
By your name 'cause I'm sorry
 (Four)
This is not apology (Skate)
You are such a distraction
 (Four)
That's what T on, aw
 (Skate)
Fuckin' up my ambiance, pause
 (Four)
You drive me cuckoo and not car
 (Skate)
'Cause I want you like Leon Ware (Fuck that)
Okay, say again it (Fuck that)
Okay, wait a minute (Woah)
I dread that shit, I am Anwar (Skate)
Curiosity killed the feline, gone
 (Four, skate)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & 
Solange
]
I think I've fallen in love (Skate)
This time I think it's for real (Four, skate)
I think I’ve fallen in love (Four, skate)
This time I think it’s for real
 (Four)
How can I tell you? (Skate) How can I tell you? (Four)
How can I tell you? (Skate) How can I tell you? (Four)
How can I tell you? (Skate) How can I tell you? (Four)
How can I tell you? (Skate) How can I tell you? (Four)

[Post-Chorus: Solange & 
Tyler, The Creator
]
I notice that you're there, but I’m always in your hair
And you're always under my microscope (
Four
)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Waste of bread, I need your attention (Skate)
I'm off balance, I need some fixin' (Four)
I’m your puppet, you are Jim Henson
 (Skate, four)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & 
Solange
]
Fallen in love now (Skate)
I think I've fallen in love
 (Four)
Fell in love now (Skate)
This time I think it's for real
 (Four)
I think I'm in love now (Skate)
I think I've fallen in love (Four)
I think I'm in love now (Skate)
This time I think it's for real (Four, four)
How can I tell you? (Shut the fuck up)
How can I tell you? (Four)
How can I tell you? (You fuckin' bitch)
How can I tell you? (Four)
How can I tell you? (Skate)
How can I tell you? (Four)
How can I tell you?
Take 'em to the bridge

[Bridge: Tyler The Creator]
(Four, four, four)
Four, four, four, four (Four, skate)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & 
Solange
]
I think I've fallen in love
 (Four)
Fell in love now (Skate)
This time I think it's for real
 (Four)
I think I'm in love now (Skate)
I think I've fallen in love
 (Four, skate)
This time I think it's for real (Oh, oh, yeah, yeah)
