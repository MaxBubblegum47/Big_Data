[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Drop it
You want me to just go in?
Alright
Uh...

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
My window is a book and I'm a fuckin' crook
Stealin' phones to call home but the line is off the hook
And if my mother answer
I'll ask her what she wants on 25th because I'm chillin' with Prancer
Rudolph, Adolf, Hitler
Rollin' with nineteen 88s like it's 1988
But my speakers are bleedin', the doctor's in uniform
Fuck cars, I have a damn unicorn that flies me to places
With spaceships, that don't need money
Where I can free at hand eat candy with Easter bunnies
Where donuts equal water, inhalers and mushrooms
And we don't have cars, we have balloons and we zoom—
Through sound and the bass is astounding
The snare plays square, no rounding
Major-ninth chords, tower synth like it's Yao Ming, Kobe
Imaginary friends, fuck homies, they don't know me
The tooth fairy blow me, swallow, don't shit this
With my Donald Trump hairpiece, you're an apprentice
You're fired and tired, you can't stay up like a limp dick
If you think you can spit, then I am the fucking dentist
My visions that I record, the instruments I adore
The happiness that I hoard can't be bought at liquor stores
You faggots can buy our chains but you [?]
And they sold on hate and reality that I ignore
You can try to walk inside my brain but I close the door
Fuck dogs, I roll around with my pet dinosaur

[Break: Tyler, the Creator]
Dinosaur
Yeah
Hodgy Beats
Drop it

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Fuck dogs, walk around with a pet dinosaur
Wing flaps on the back of my pet rhinosaur
Gold chain, 24, niggas must be shinin' more
The money gets closer when you seem to be grinding more
And it feels better than a tongue-kiss
Carbonated with the flow, orange-flavored Sunkist
We musically grow unto the world like a fungus
Amongst this, playin' the piano like a trumpet
Little guy, but his words sound so humongous
Eat 'til you obese, arteries clot, need lunges
MellowHype from Ralph Lauren to the Hundreds
My crew cliqued up like Brady Bunches
The captain that crunches, invitin' you to lunches
My nutrition have robots malfunction
I suggest you stay away from the factory
My breath chemical, I don't know how you'll react to me
It's a dog-eat-dog world, so I double doggy dare it
Hold it in my hand as I stare it
Down, like a magnifying glass to a diamond with a karat
I read through niggas that bluff like a tarot
They copy my actions, I call them fools parrots
I'm the pirate with one eyelid that weareth
Long hair for wisdom while bitchmades Nair it
I don't care if the heat I throw is unbeara—
Ble, Just know, it's sharea—ble
And there I go, where I go
I don't know, obviously, I disappear
Close your eyes, bitch, I'm all in your ear
I have your hearts as if I stabbed it with a spear
And wrote my flows with your blood smears
If you can't see a legend, I'ma make it clear
Nigga, I'm right here

[Refrain: Hodgy Beats & Tyler, the Creator]
Golden grill
Cadillac Deville
Drop it
Nigga, we pimpin'
Grill golden
Chain frozen
We pimpin'
We pimpin', we pimpin'
Golden grill
Cadillac Deville
We pimpin' (O.F.M.)
Nigga, we pimpin' (Banging on your F.M.)
Grill golden
Chain frozen
We pimpin'
We pimpin', we pimpin'
