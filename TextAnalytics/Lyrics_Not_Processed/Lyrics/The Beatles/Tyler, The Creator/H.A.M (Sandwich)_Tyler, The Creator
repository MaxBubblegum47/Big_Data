[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Bitch ass niggas don't know me, new sandwich with bologna
I ain't really y'all niggas friends, none of you motherfuckers is my homie
I bought a brand new treat, y'all niggas don't know me
A B C, 1 2 3, AK-47 hit a nigga in his teeth
He can talk a lot of shit but don't really wanna be handling the motherfucking business that he needs to
I'm a hit a motherfucking nigga in the back when I see you
Fiji Water, Fiji Water, I'mma go and piss on my daughter
You don't believe me, I'm a monster
