[Intro]
Wolf fucking Haley
I'm not fucking crazy, fucking crazy
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Okay, it's my turn to rap (Do that)

[Verse]
Fucking modern day Ian Curtis I oughta been
The motherfuckin' bulls was hotter than a Dennis Rod-a-Man
All the men and girls was tied up inside a cottage and
Raquel, Riley, Brandun, Alexis, fuckin' Milan and them
House’s egg yolking, motherfuckin' ain’t joking
Throats chokin' hulkin that motherfuckers like I’m Hulk Hogan
Halloween at Neverland Ranch? I’m Macaulay Culkin
Fuckin' Superbad swag when I murder Seth Rogen
I’m sick, this asthma, takin' 6 Robitussin
I’m fuckin' this game up no trojans for the semen
On the boat, better vote and fuckin' pray
Even though the pope is bogus
Even though I’m hyped the dopest
2Dope don’t wanna post us
Copy all we are off how we all are rockin
And they kosher but don’t trip
My pockets got a loaf of that
I’ll show you how you’re supposed to rap
Yeah, for the blonde bitches
They say they enjoy the vision
I’m the man now the boys missin' from the decision
My television is eclectic
How can he move on Waka Flocka and back to Joy Division?
Yeah, I said that I received info now the surgeon is missing
Probably cause I dressed up as a nurse
Went it to his office, gave him his cup of coffee
Aw, now he is feeling nauseous buzzin' me to walk in
Takin’ all the doctor calls, ask her to prescribe
A bunch of shit that he can munch and such
He asked what was in the coffee, I just coughed a blush
Whatchu say? (Hey! Wait, your not! WHAT THE FUCK!)
Hit him with the uppercut then cut him up
With the roughest tools
And I found out the wolves had
Aten some sections of ugly sluts
Fuck! Now I got blood on my new fuckin' sneakers and stuff
Fuck it, storage room where this doctor's getting his body stuffed
By this fuckin' awesome, thrashin' African that’s marvelous
With green supreme hats, smoker’s head, it was a pot of luck
I love Taylor Swift, Date Rape Sirloin, in a wife beater with a Chris Brown iron-on
Bitch, I’m tighter than a stogie and a lighter
The cuts thats on Taylor or the Braces when I bite her
After that I will retain her from leaving gaps and gashes
When I brush her with the rubber bands leaving gummy rashes
Laughing Gas, Pass her out, fool beat this
Cause I’ll do to her what my father didn’t really give
And that’s not hard to figure out but just in case it is
I’ll make it really hard to get it out, if you catch my drift

Wolf, Gang
Fuck
