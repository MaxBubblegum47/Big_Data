[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
You like my songs, I like your tits
But deep down, I don't really like you, bitch
You got a nice tongue and you wear a nice thong
But bitch you dumb as fuck to right from wrong (Left)
(Left) You're on my bed, but Simon's red
Now Simon says get the fuck out my life
Cause you're not my wife, bitch you're a stand for this night
And you could be a stab for this knife
I'm seventeen ('Teen), you're twenty-six (Six)
You're a divorced slut and you can't suck dick (Bitch)
You dropped outta college, you can't pay shit
But I'm broke as fuck too, bitch, we on the same boat (Float)
Where's my inhaler? I think I'm gonna puke
Cause I can't believe I lost my virginity to you (Bitch)
Yeah, you was in it and I was in it too
But I guess I'm just gonna make this fish stew because

[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]

Man, I got these bitches brewin' (Bitch)
Man, I got these bitches brewin'
Fuckin' up my gold pots
Man, I got these bitches brewin'

Man, I got these bitches brewin'  (Bitch)
Fuckin' up my gold pots

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Bitch, shake your ass (Ass), shake it until the wet sweat
Crawls right down the crack of your ass
Booty meat snackin' (Smackin'), back that ass up
Until you come back up and lick my sack up
I'm Tyler, the Creator
Hang with thrashers and skaters
I do sound like Darth Vader
But that's not stoppin' me from eating your muffin

[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator]
I think you and your friends
Should come with me to get your salad tossed
'Cause when I make this stew in your gold pot
I'm adding extra sauce
Because...

[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
I got these bitches brewin' (Bitch)
Man, I got these bitches brewin' (Bitch)
Man, I got these bitches brewin' (Bitch)
Fuckin' up my gold pots (Rrrah!)
Man, I got these bitches brewin'
Man, I got these bitches brewin' (Fucking bitch)
Man, I got these bitches brewin'
Fuckin' up my gold pots
Man, I got these bitches brewin'

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
I got these bitches brewin'
Inside of my gold pots
And there's wet pussy on my face
Shake that ass and don't make vibrations stop
Bitch
