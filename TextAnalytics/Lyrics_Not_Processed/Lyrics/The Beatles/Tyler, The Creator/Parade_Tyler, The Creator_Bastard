[Verse 1]
Welcome to the euphoria of cocaine without Abel
I can make music that makes sense, but not mentally stable
Eighteen with the whole world in front of me
Odd Future teenagers, nobody can fuck with we

[Verse 2]
I scream and jump around on couches while you sit and talk
I skip to places, smiling faces, while you fucking walk
My TV stays on Cartoon Network, fuck that Twilight shit
You have highlights about yo life, I have life 'bout my highlights, bitch
Go to college, get a job, marry, have a kid
Watch them grow and then you die? No, nigga, fuck the system

[Verse 3]
Good kids make bad grown ups, stay gold, stray old
Maturing means that your life sucks, in my wolf suit
I roam where the wild things at, still growing
Still learnin, not knowing that I'm maxed
I don't want to grow up, I know that shit for a fact
Nigga, eighteen

[Verse 4]
They say I'm immature, I say that they depressed
I talk to unicorns, I'm wearing a uniform
Of a nigga that don't give a fuck about time
You live your life all serious while I'm enjoying mine

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator & *Dr. TC*]
*Wow, that's, that's a really good way to look at it*
Yeah I mean... I don't. I mean I'm really hyper and everything with my imagination
*Ohh okay - ADHD?*
I'm not having ADHD like, one second I'm real hype as fuck, but the next minute - I can just slow that shit down
