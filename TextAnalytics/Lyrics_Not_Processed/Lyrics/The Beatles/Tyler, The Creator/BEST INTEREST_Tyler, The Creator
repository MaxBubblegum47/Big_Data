[Verse 1]
Darling, darling, darling
It's no need to worry
It’s just a couple things
(Just a couple things on my brain, you know?)
If it's you and other
It's no need to worry (You don’t have to worry)
'Cause I can sleep between you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a third wheeler
I'm a side bettor
I'm a homewrecker
Give it up
I'm a third wheeler
I'm a side bettor
I'm a homewrecker
Give it up, give it up, give it up

[Chorus]
I’ll keep your, your best interest
I’ll keep your, your best interest
I'll keep your best interest
I’ll keep your best interest

[Verse 2]
I was, I was, I was, I was out here playing games
You was out here with a lame one
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the, I’m the side nigga
I gotta sneak around and hide with you
I wanna see you, give me five minutes
Paparazzi probably got like five pictures (Click-click-click-click)
(I won't tell anybody, it's our secret)
Top, top, top, top of the morning like yeehaw
I took my shot, this is B-ball, nigga
The team you play for is seesaw
So I know that it's fake when I see y'all
Don't wanna fuck what you got up
I would never blow your spot up
I know my place, I'm the landlord
I'll carry the weight 'til my hands sore
(We can't keep doing this)

[Chorus]
I'll keep your, your best interest (It's our secret)
I'll keep your best interest
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)
