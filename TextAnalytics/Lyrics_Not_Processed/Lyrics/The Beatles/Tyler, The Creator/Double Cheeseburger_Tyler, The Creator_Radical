[Verse 1: Domo]
Six-fifty, three hundred my shirt free
Shoot for the sky like a church league, y'all heard me
Absurd G, chickens clucking for bird seeds
But I gotta apologize, no Greece like Xerxes
Won't heat or burn me, I'm the coolest nigga here
Usually defecation, now I'm pissing in your ear
My tablet is the ratchet and the pistols in the rear
I'll bang if it was bangless, now the tracks no longer here
Metaphor, chilling with better whores
Smoking then later on, I bone them like Skeletor
What would I sell this for, this is free distribution
Style, they straight jack it like mental institutions
Outfits is ruthless, now your bitch is choosing
She floating round winners, now your bitch you losing
Yeah, cause I'm the Super Sega Genesis
Salute me, game: invented it, and you can't get no membership, little bitch

[Verse 2: Wolf Haley]
Six hundred sixty-six, leave it for the tip
Of my dick, head, meltin' off and let it rip
Just like a cannon from the teen in Nick
That's equivalent, to the poison in a cigarette
Tyler the Creator invented some new shit
And it's probably from the Illuminati, Nazi descent, so
If I give a fuck, it's probably from my dick
When I'm Cheneyin' your daughter, she's tied up inside a tent, yeah
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang presents
We're back like a black bitch's hairline indent
The shit I represent is killin' niggas and shit
That's why I traded R. Kelly my sister for a new hit
I get it crackin' like the lips of a nigga, actor
Or a Dahmer when he invited me in for cheese and crackers
Just to watch the Grammys, man she's so attractive
Now he's mad and tryna run me over out with Gacy's tractor
Hop over, run backwards, with a knap sack of green Supreme hats
Like I was sponsored up by the fuckin' Packers
Shittin' on niggas, my tongue considered a laxative
Maxi pad, leave the beat brown like Rihanna lips
Back washing to my gang, you don't wanna take a sip
Fuck Wolf Gang, fuck what? Here let's take a trip
Take a look, to this bullet, now my finger slipped
My only purpose in life to kill myself up on accident
Freshjive, yeah I get it no charge
Dick soft as fuck, but somehow I go hard
Forearm with my gang name, that's an old carve
Chima Ferguson's bangin', you Ace niggas is Low Card, Wolf Gang

[Verse 3: Jasper]
Niggas rollin' deep, burners pulled out
Niggas in the street scared
Cause I got the burner in the hand~

[Outro: Tyler]
That shit was wack as fuck
Don't ever rap again in your fuckin' life
