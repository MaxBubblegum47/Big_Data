[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler, you... obviously have some fucking problems
And, this—, this is... this is the end of this session, let's... anything else you've gotta say?

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & 
Dr. TC
]
Mom is getting jealous, I see my manager more
Than I see her before I go on tour and it hurts (
Yeah
)
I miss the days when this was fun, but now it turned into work
And getting legal, so I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out
As you should, that shit's outrageous
My friends are turning into opposites
Because my life is turning into opposite of 
sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids who copy shit
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
All alone, bawling 'til my muhfuckin' eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man, fuck
I'm here to talk to you
I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
Who, Travis?
Niggas saying "Free Earl" without even knowin' him
See, they're missing a new album, I'm missing my only friend

[Interlude 1: Dr. TC & 
Tyler, The Creator
]
You have everyone around you
You have thirty meetings a day
I don't see what it is
I mean, you—you act like you don't have anyone to talk to
I'm here for you, I'm your friend
When I say "Odd," y'all say "Future!"
Odd... Uh-uh, nah, that shit's corny as fuck
Fuck!
You're doin' good, you have a cult following
You're—"Yonkers"...
Tch—To these white kids?
Oh, my gosh

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & 
Dr. TC
]
Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
Nauseous with the Nazi, but it's normal what the cops see
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see
Mommy was a living single queen with a La-ti
So while my wallets piling with symbolic-colored paper
I lace her, 'cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
20, 
why didn't she get that abortion?
Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing
Into a Grammy-winning, schizophrenic, 
fucking orphan
Oops! I mean, 
bastard,
 skinny-ass disaster
Mom works hard, still working on her masters
Son lies about taking classes at community college
Just to record some bullshit he calls 
Bastard
 (
Yeah?
)
Start a fucking cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got was a fucking shitty article in 
Thrasher

[Interlude 2: Dr. TC & 
Tyler, The Creator
]
All right, just calm down
That ain’t shit, man
Now, don’t—don’t—don’t make yourself feel guilty
That—that article was great...
No, fuck that, nigga
You're beating yourself up and you're living the fucking life right now, kid!
When I was your age, I would have loved to be fucking doing the things that you're doing right now
Fuck that, fuck all this shit!
You—You—You act like I’m not here
You're not!
I'm exactly who you’re supposed to be talking to
You don’t fucking help me with shit!
You don’t help me with shit! Fuck!
Yeah, you get... that—that—who wouldn’t do that?
Fuck you! Fuck, you!
Who wouldn’t—who wouldn't shoot their friend?
Old fucking fuck!
That’s fine, it’s not your fault
I killed my fucking friends! Fuck!
(We're gonna need security in here, and, uh…)
Fuck! I didn't fucking sign up for this shit!
(Gonna need something to calm him down)
I'm—I'm not fucking crazy—I'm a fucking table! I'm a fucking table!
(Yes, come quick, he’s losing it)
No, fuck this shit!
Tyler, calm down!

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & 
Dr. TC
]
I'ma grab the Nina (
No!
) and find a nice arena
'Cause I can’t even choose between Ortega or Sabrina
Get security in here
And I’m not even human, I’m a body-shaped demon
With some semen in my sack, and some problems in the back
Calm the fuck down!
And a life that’s fill with crap, and a finger filled with hate
And a gat that’s filled with love, now let opposites attract
I can finally be one (
No!
) like a marriage in a church
But this marriage has a hearse
And the parents of the one that’s getting married has a curse
And it’s made up inside of him
Too late to reimburse 
but, wait, it gets worse!
All the guests that’s in the church all decided to disperse (
Tyler...
)
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse 
You don't want to do this...
So they tied the knot
Now it’s too late to reverse this arrangement
Yes, it is!
And the nurse is amazed at the hurt that he was pained and
Calm the fuck down!
But it was obvious in all the photos he was painting
Now, a bunch of whispering immerse...

[Outro: Dr. TC, 
Tyler, The Creator
, 
Security Guard
 & 
Nurse
]
Yeah, he's right there, security's right there
Shit! No! Get away from me!
 (Get him)
And then the nurse blurts...
 (
Come here
)
What the fuck is his problem?
Here, we have two doses to give him, here
Why didn’t anybody ask him first?
(
Get on the ground!
)
Hold him down
I’ve been asking you this whole time, Tyler
Get the fuck away from me! Get away from me!
(
Come here, motherfucker!
)
Because nobody gave a fuck
Get the fuck off of me...
Someone gave a fuck, Tyler, and, uh...
The person that gave a fuck was me
See, you’re not going crazy...
It’s me
I’m your best friend, Tyler
I know everything, I know everything about you
You’ve been helping yourself this whole time
Your friends? They’re just figments of your imagination
Dr. TC... See, Tyler, I’m your conscience
I’m Tron Cat...
I’m Ace...
I’m Wolf Haley...
I’m...
Me
