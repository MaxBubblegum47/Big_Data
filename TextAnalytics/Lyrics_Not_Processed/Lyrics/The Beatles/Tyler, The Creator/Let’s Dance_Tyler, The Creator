[Intro]
Hey! What's your name? Oh, that's nice
Me? I'm Wolf, you can call me Tyler though
I'm eighteen, you from around here?
Oh, you look like my next victim
I said you look like my ex-girlfriend, sister

[Verse 1]
While James is jamming on the mixer
We can play Twister naked
Don't be afraid, it's just a kiss
I'm open to everything if you're inviting your sister
That's another topic, we should start a project
You could be the lab rat, I could be the doctor
Let me drug you up and put different things in you
But I'm not gonna do that until you begin to pass out
Now I can draw your face up pretty
Or do it jackass and leave your breath all shitty
Or I can get the hand held and hold held titty
And stick my dick in you but that just might offend you
Teenage parties, I recommend you
Never get drunk with a nigga like us
But I kinda like your company
And you rubbing on my dick, yeah it comforts me
Fuck, condom pocket, luckily, I brought one
Herpes virus, yeah bitch, I fought one
I don't want you to have my permit yet
That I just haven't came up with a name yet
I got some new shit, well technically, I got a new dick
The other one fell off in a pulpit
A gay coaches' white grease and Chris Stokes
Blew the fuck up in gray clouds of thick smoke
Funny, right? Ha-ha, this shit's jokes
I got the idea from a letter that the shit wrote

[Hook]
Hey, you right there
In that pretty red dress, let's dance
I said hey, you right there
In that pretty red dress, let's fuck (rough)

[Verse 2]
Well, I have a gram cupcake mix
Mix a little syrup, it ain't no way to cure him
But I don't do the syrup, I just do the sniffles
Take a couple bits, bitch kibbles, bitch I gotta riddle
What can you tickle that can make a dinosaur giggle
I'm tryna get your puss, your pimple is a push
Away from the tush, I don't smoke kush
I don't do drugs, I don't even club
I don't drink beer, why the fuck am I here
The girls are really cute but there on X
And that's a better reason to for me to take advantage with sex
And you might be next, you pass out on
Me and your mouth drool, throw you in my van now it's carpool
Let you rest your ass on my dick like a barstool
Going deep like a scuba with the snorkle
You never gonna forgive me, but your so damn pretty
I'mma drop you off home quickly
You passed out, bitch you ain't even listening
And leave your house empty, your neighbors didn't see me
Your never gonna get me, your self respect were skimpy
You was up thirty, now you're down fifty
Abracadabra your memory I'm tricky
You are what I rob so I guess your pussy empty
Just like your home by taking the store of oreos
Over by the cabin of cheerios and the mint tea

[Interlude]
Yep. But.. I had fun, tonight..

[Hook]
