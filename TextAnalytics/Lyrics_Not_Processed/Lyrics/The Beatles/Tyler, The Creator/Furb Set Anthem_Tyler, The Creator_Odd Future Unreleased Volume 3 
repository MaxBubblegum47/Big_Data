[Verse 1]
I dont give a fuck I dont give a shit
I'll get a bitch to suck my elbow
I got a sweater and its blue
I ain't got one I got three
I ain't no gang member I ain't no cuz
But I'm wearing all red cause im a yellow
Person and only im screamin'
I don't bust nuts I fill your girls mouth with white stuff

[Verse 2]
I got friends that sell drugs
Guess where we at, we at the social hall
With them bitches hitting them swishas
Give me them lips and we giving them hugs
You already know we be all gang banging
Already know that we got drugs going to the store
Probably buying some pancake mix
I dont even go to the store

[Verse 3]
Yeah, what you know about wearing a sweater
That don't match what my shoes like homie
I don't play that shit I got a gun
Homie don't walk you better skip
Fuck that trick, fuck that ho
I make money, I make cheddar
You know who I am, you know where I be
You know plus 1 plus 2 is 4
All up in the club, now I'm at the door
You don't got enough so I guess you want more
Ho I eat chocolate and marshmallows
So that's a smore
