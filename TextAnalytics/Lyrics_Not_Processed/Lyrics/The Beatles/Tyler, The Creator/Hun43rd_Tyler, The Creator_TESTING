[Intro: Thug Life]
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh
All year long bruh, stuck up in my zone all by my lonesome
Pay the hoe my dues, I brought my own funds
When it's time to war, I brought my own gun
Difference is I'm ghetto but I'm wholesome
Nigga say I switched up like I'm on some
Why you always treat me like I owe some?
Truthfully you only wanna hold some
Whip it like I've been a slave
Bucking from the twelve like I've been afraid
Motorola, burn out, couple minutes saved
Kept a pre-paid on my hip them days
143rd in front on Minisink
Cam'ron had us wearing pink
From the cradle to the grave
Putting work, hustle round the corner where my nana stay
Couldn't work, open up shop in front the corner store
Make 'em renovate, with the killer stain
Fuck a lemonade but they cook it by the Minute Maid
Couple niggas hate
But the best form of flattery is when you imi-
When you imitate, ayy

[Chorus: Dev Hynes & A$AP Rocky]
Tell me how it gonna be
Get like me, tell me how it's gonna, how it's gonna be
Tell me how it gonna be
Like me, tell me how it's gonna be
Tell me how it gonna be, oh
I'ma have a ball, I'ma cop it all, I'ma buy the store
Tell me how it gonna be
I'ma go ball, cradle to the grave
Busy gettin' paid, niggas don't shade, nigga I'ma have it–

[Interlude: Thug Life]
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
With my back against the wall, nigga, I'ma ball
Show you how to mob, got it with the squad (Yeah)
Never had a job, but I kept a broad
When I went in Saks, went and copped it all
My cougars had me lit, kept a PYT
Your mama on my dick, prettier than a bitch
And I'm overseas, and I had a ball
Seein' overseas hoes (Really litty lit, uh)
We ain't counterfeit like we have face tats
How you name go when
Where your hoes, why your chain don't spin?
Light them up, really like 'em all
Nigga, like it all, nigga, like it, tell her get like me

[Chorus: Dev Hynes & A$AP Rocky]
Tell me how it gonna be
Get like me, tell me how it's gonna, how it's gonna be
Tell me how it gonna be
Like me, tell me how it's gonna be
Tell me how it gonna be, ohh
I'ma have a ball, I'ma cop it all, I'ma buy the store
Tell me how it gonna be
I'ma go ball, cradle to the grave
Busy gettin' paid, niggas don't shade, nigga I'ma have it–

[Outro: A$AP Twelvyy, ScHoolboy Q & Tyler, The Creator]
Ball! Ball, nigga, Ball!
Ball, nigga, ball! Ball, nigga, ball!
Ball, nigga, ball! Ball, nigga, ball!
Ball, nigga, ball! Ball, nigga, ball!
Ball, nigga, ball! Ball, nigga, ball!
Ball, nigga, ball! Ball, nigga, ball!
Bow, wow, bow, wow, bow, nigga, bow!
Bow, nigga, bow! (Shoot)
