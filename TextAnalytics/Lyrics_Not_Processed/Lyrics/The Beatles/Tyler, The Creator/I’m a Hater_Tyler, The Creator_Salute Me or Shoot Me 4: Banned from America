[Verse 2: Tyler the Creator]
Umm, hey fellow how ya doin'? Well I’m doin' bad and I hope your day's ruined
When you're on stage I'm the one that’s booin' 'cause I hate your guts, hehe
I be in the bushes lurking, why you live your life so Goddamn perfect?
'Cause my life sucks and it serves no purpose, I'm gonna fuck yours up to make shit worth it
Yeah, faggot, why the fuck do you have it?
Why the fuck don't I got it and anyway? I could stop it
Is perfect, fuck your moms, dead homies and bitch you sleep with
Fuck yo food, the protein in it, and fork you eat with
Now have your wife beat dick, get pregnant and then make you think that
It's yours, now that's the real definition of sneak diss
I'm Silky Johnson's left hand, coming like the next trend
It sucks 'cause I'm your best friend, nigga

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah I'm a hater, fuck your wrists
Yeah I'm a hater, fuck your life
Yeah I'm a hater, nigga fuck your money
Fuck your car, nigga fuck your clique
Yeah I'm a hater, fuck your wrists
Yeah I'm a hater, nigga fuck your car
Yeah I'm a hater, (Nigga) fuck your money
Nigga fuck your life, fuck your clique (Squad)

[Verse 3: D-Bo]
Time is money, you can die today Audemar
Niggas dribble like they forgot how much your body cost
I'm in the hood, nobody gone
All these chains lookin' like it's fuckin' Mardi Gras
My top down, seat way back
Don't respect the squad – get your face cracked
DT young is kinda bad, that's why you stay tat
Cal the cleanup crew, no A chance
Wait hold on I'm still white, who gon' say something?
All that fessils like my youngins won't fake something
DGBSM, we gon' shake somethin'
Potato on my belt, watch me bake something
