I said Lisa you a stupid bitch
Kissed my dad gave em herpes now
He got crabs from this last girl

Bitch
I gave you what you want, Gave you what you need
Then I gave you a kiss, Now my penis bleeds
Now I'm at the clinic bitch, Now I'm stuck up at the dentist
In this motherfucking relation, I hate it bitch it's finished
You gave me war, I gave you peace
Infection on your yeast then you tried to fuck my niece
She only seven but when she turn eleven
Ya'll can fuck the indians for hotdogs at 7eleven
Huh You tried to give a kiss but the little bitch
Got herpes on her lips and here bitch listen
You was it, I wasn't pimpin'
You half black How the fuck you gonna burn up all the chicken
You can't make Kool-Aid, I'm so serious
No fruit punch so I had to drink your period
Fuckin' buying bape dildos up on my visa
I was in love with you Lisa
