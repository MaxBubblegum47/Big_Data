[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Teenage billionaires
He's beating records off the top the holes of money
He roll rover sell base for 12 a pop
Hodgy eating rapers whole, never digest I'm dope
Shit since they coming out of him like crack heads
Like fuck I should be illegal eagles flying over state
And the model bitch
(She look good)
And the head is great
The Pink stripe is for diplomatic immunity
I'm A-C-E-A-K to fuck up the community
(Holla holla holla, Spit another one real quick)
Niggas Stez biting like they Mike Tyson
Here these queers taking credit like their
Faggot card is debit fines hit me on my beepa
Could be on the keys then I push it out sneaka bitch
I'm bunny like the Basket-baller
[Ya]
I'm the dope dealer push man in the dream state
Your bitch sticks to me like purple schotch tape
[I'm lime green]
The Pink stripe is for diplomatic immunity
I'm A.C.E. aka Mr. Fuck Up the Community

[Verse 2: Blak tha Map]
I don't serve much but let me take your order
Guaranteed to get your chips while I gallop aforda
Flip a check quick like we betting with quarters
And I beat the cut like we talkin' 'bout horfa
Especially if she looks like canorfa
I not saying I would never do more than ork her
I'm just saying I would do never divorce her
But I don't know if I could afford her
But J.K. cause Ima I'm ballin'
If life was a chip then hommie I'm all in
Yesterday's money was talkin'
Yes the shit was callin'
Telling me to take over the world
Like a young Jospeh Stallin
Dirty dog records beating all the pussies
Never shopping unless were talking bout diamonds and stussy
Yo I'm probably with your chick
Playing with her cliteris
Yep
Her friend is coming for a lick
Look I'm not your father don't even bother
I pulled out early
