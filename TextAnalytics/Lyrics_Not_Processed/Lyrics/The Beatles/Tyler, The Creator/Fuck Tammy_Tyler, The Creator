[Tyler, The Creator]
Ignorant, Atheist, sound like a fucking monster
Tall, skinny, lanky, buck it, fuck it badass posture
Cops are angering the hell
Where they discounted mounted
With the devil, he was formal and some Polo and some Dockers
Dancing with him playing vengeance Cindi Lauper with some Crips
In all red like they playin' Red Lobster
My bitch is white Italian to be exact
Mobster is her father and he'll kill me
When he finds out I'm reading her Harry Potter
FUCK HIM!, Im a Demon fill your daughter up with semen
With Supreme embroidered logos, making fun of homos cause its funny
Tommy rugby hilfiger screaming nigga with the klux
I'm a fuckin' Nazi with a condom, barely give a fuck
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Fuck Lame, 91'
We hockey fuckin' awesome, hit you with the Wolf Gang puck
Puck, trucks thunder now shes in the trunk wondering why shes about to get raped and chopped up, lumber
He said, write a sixteen, well she was seventeen
And I'm only eighteen and that's statutory rape
And if you fuckin' snitch on me I guess i'll make the great escape
To have a date with your dead body and I cannot be late
Might do a Ted Bundy, I can consider ya'll some haughtys
If they find me at my home, guess I gotta fuckin roam
All alone ,in the streets, gotta hustle drugs for food
Gotta sell beats for clothes if I really wanna eat
Fuck you, 
O.F.M. Bangin' on your mothafuckin' FM
Fuck Tammy
