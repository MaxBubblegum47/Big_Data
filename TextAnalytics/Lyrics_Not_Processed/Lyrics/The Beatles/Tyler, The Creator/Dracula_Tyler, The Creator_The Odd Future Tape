[Intro]
A-C-E, O-F, uh

[Verse 1]
Wild, I'm not tame just because my visions are strange
I am normal not deranged, I am not a fucking lame
Your pee dripping wet, I need all my nutrients
On the phone, if I take you home how much can I get?
Yeah, I like you but, you act like you don't like us
We could start a whole new religion girl, in Odd we trust
You play hard to got, got me hard like cement
Here's my car I love please do not dip, please just

[Hook]
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(But please don't) wait
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(But please don't) wait

[Verse 2]
I'm a fucking monster, my Tonka is trucker
In my locker got books, I'm a nasty mothafucker
Truth or dare in the cemetery, right past the elementary
My faith lasts for the whole century
You could bite my neck or I could bite your neck
Or you could bite her and excite her you will not regret
My castle got dungeons, my dungeons got dungeons
Open up them legs, let me see what's for luncheon

[Hook]
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(But please don't) wait
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(But please don't) wait

[Bridge]
And the sky is dark
The bats invade the park
The water swims the shark
But don't just wait, go
