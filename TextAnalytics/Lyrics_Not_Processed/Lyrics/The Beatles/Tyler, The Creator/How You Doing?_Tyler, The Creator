[Intro]
Ah-ha-ha, yeah, woo

[Verse]
Fucked my granny up, just to get that bitch purse
I wore that motherfucker to the Catholic church
I'm looking pretty, your bitch looking like P. Diddy
I'm fly like that nigga, ha-ha, baby
I'm eating ham, eating dressing and bitch you know how I fuckin' beef
Look at my purse bitch, you can't find me, you can't find you
Bitch, you know, I'm in your sheets, I got the bat, I'm 'bout to beat
Your head in, bitch, yeah, damn!

[Hook: Tyler]
How you doing?
Bitch, how you doing? (I'm doing good)
Bitch, how you doing?
