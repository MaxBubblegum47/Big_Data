Ride around town in a McLaren
I’ma let the air in
I can see it in your eyes
It about to happen, it about to happen
When I’m on a mission
You the reason I’m not missin’ ooh
Why would I look both ways?
Only look your way
2X
I’m a fucking walking paradox, no I’m not
Threesomes with a fucking triceratops, reptar
Rapping as I’m mocking deaf rock stars
Wearing synthetic wigs made of Anwar’s dreadlocks
Bedrock, harder than a motherfucking flintstone
Making crack rocks outta ... fishbones
This boy Jasper trying to get grown
About 5’7’’ of his bitches in my bedroom
When I’m on a mission
You the reason I’m not missin’ ooh
Why would I look both ways?
Only look your way
2X
Take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That onе day you won't be here
I will not fеtch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothing to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, about to walk in the pen-
