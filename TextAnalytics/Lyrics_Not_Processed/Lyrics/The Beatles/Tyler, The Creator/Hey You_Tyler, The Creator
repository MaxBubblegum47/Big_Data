[Intro]
Hey... you...

[Verse 1]
Looking good in that skirt
Flirting is the effective way that this works
Bingo [Shapow] how about we go
Down to the lake and eat a couple of pringles
Picnic by the way, hey I’m single
Pardon my bad manners, french and lingo
Intentions were (my intentions were) brighter than the summer
Reflection in the lake being seen by Stevie
You're a golden lady
 and it seems that me and you
We’re supposed to be the ozone team but who
Would have thought this conversation would have grew
Into me talking about sun rays with you!
I’m turning to a creep, that just won’t sleep
Next sex, that's cause you used to that kind of poo
See I'm the new shit in town
Lets mash together and make new browns
How that sound?

[Hook]
Hey, shit, it sounds cool to me
It sounds cool to me
Oh it sounds cool to me
It sounds cool to me!
It sounds cool to me!
It sounds cool to me!
Hey girl, that shit sounds cool to me!
Shit sounds good to me!
