[Verse 1]
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do
I'm half crazy all for the loving of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
And I cannot afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet on the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
We will go tandem as man and wife
Peddling the way down the road of life
When the roads dark we can all despise
There are bright lights in the dazzling eyes

[Outro]
Daisy, Daisy Bell
(Daisy, Daisy, Daisy Bell)
