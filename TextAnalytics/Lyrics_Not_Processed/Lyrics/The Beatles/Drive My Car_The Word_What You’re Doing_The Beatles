Drive My Car

[Verse 1]
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said "Baby, can't you see?
I wanna be famous, a star of the screen
But you can do something in between"

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah
What You're Doing

[Chorus]
Look, what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
You got me running and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
The Word
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love
Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah
Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah
Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah
Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah
Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah
Beep beep-m beep beep, yeah
