Oh, yeah, I’ll tell you somethin'
I think you'll understand.
When I say that somethin’,
I think you'll think I'm grand.
I want to work here, please.
I swear I'm qualified.

Oh please, say to me,
That you'll hire me,
And please say to me,
I'm a good fit for the company.

Now, let me tell you 'bout myself:
I want to work for you.

I'm pretty good at
Writing stuff. . . no lie.
It’s such a talent, that no money
Can buy. . .
Can buy. . .
Can buy. . .

Yeah, I write great content.
From this song you can see,
When I put my mind to work,
I’m full of creativity. . .
I'm pretty great, let’s agree. . .
Come on, hire me, please.

And when I'm hired
I will work, so much.
If you were wise you would get,
In touch. . .
In touch. . .
In touch. . .

Yeah, I got that somethin'
I know you're looking for,
So please, hire me.
I want to work here, please.

I want to work here, please.
I want to work here, please.

Come on and hire me, please.
