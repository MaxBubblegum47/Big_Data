I'm sure to fall
Fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet
And so near
I'm sure to fall in love with you
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life
