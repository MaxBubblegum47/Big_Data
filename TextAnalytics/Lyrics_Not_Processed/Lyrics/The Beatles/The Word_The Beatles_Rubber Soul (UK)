[Verse 1]
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Bridge 1]
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good

[Verse 2]
Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Bridge 2]
Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read

[Verse 3]
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Bridge 3]
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light

[Verse 4]
Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Outro]
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
