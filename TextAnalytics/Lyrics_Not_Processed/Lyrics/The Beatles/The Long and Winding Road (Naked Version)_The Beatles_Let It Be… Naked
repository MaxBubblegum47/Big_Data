[Verse 1]
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you've always known
The many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me standing here
Lead me to you door

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door
