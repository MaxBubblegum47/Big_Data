[Chorus: John Lennon]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

[Bridge: George Harrison]
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free

Ah
Ah
Ah

[Verse 2]
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Oooooo

[Outro]
Free

Made for John Lennon
