Gave you them whiskey eyes
Those California dreaming nights
I never thought we’d be this high
We’re dancing side by side
And she drinking on the lime
Her heart can lie tonight
She holding onto mine
The feelings won’t subside
I don’t know why

It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
But I know that it feels right
It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
But I know that it feels right

Gave you them whiskey eyes
Those California dreaming nights
I never thought we’d be this high
We’re dancing side by side
Now we drunk in love tonight
Staring at the sky
The stars a passing by
Don’t you let me try
If it’s just this one time

It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
But I know that it feels right
It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
But I know that it feels right
