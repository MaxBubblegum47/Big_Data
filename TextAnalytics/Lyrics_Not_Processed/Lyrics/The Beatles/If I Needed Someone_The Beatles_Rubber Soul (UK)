[Verse 1]
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

[Verse 2]
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

[Bridge]
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

[Verse 3]
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 4]
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

[Bridge]
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

[Verse 3]
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah
