[Verse 1]
Since she's been gone
I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same, but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
So go away, leave me alone
Don't bother me

[Verse 2]
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own
It's just not right, when every night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

[Bridge]
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

[Verse 3]
But till she's here
Please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me

[Guitar solo]

[Refrain]
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

[Bridge]
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

[Verse 3]
But till she's here
Please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me

[Outro]
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't-
