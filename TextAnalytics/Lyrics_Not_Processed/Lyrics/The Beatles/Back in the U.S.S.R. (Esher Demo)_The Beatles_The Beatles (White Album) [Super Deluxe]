[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way, the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a awful flight

[Chorus]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Verse 2]
Been away so long, I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone

[Chorus]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S., back in the U.S
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Bridge]
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind (do do do do)
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my my mind

[Verse 1]
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way, the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a awful flight

[Chorus]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Bridge]
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind (do do do do do)
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my my mind

[Verse 2]
I've been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone

[Chorus]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S.S.R
