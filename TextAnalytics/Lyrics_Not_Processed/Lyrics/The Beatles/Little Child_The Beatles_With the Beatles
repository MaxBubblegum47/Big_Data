[Chorus]
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

[Chorus]
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

[Verse 1]
If you want someone
To make you feel so fine
Then we'll have some fun
When you're mine, all mine
So come, come on, come on

[Chorus]
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

[Instrumental break - Harmonica solo]

[Verse 2]
When you're by my side
You're the only one
Don't you run and hide
Just come on, come on
Yeah come on, come on, come on

[Verse - Outro]
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me (Oh yeah)
Baby take a chance with me (Oh yeah)
Baby take a chance with me (Oh yeah)
