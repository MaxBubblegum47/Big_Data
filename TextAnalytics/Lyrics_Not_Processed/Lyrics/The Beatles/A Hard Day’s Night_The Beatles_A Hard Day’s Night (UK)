[Verse 1: John Lennon]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah!

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Ah!

[Guitar and Piano Solo: George Harrison and George Martin]

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling  you holding me tight
Tight, yeah!

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

[Outro: John Lennon]
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright
