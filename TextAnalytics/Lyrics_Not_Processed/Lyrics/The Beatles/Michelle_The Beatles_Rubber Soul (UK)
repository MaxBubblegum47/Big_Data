[Verse 1]
Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle

[Verse 2]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Bridge 1]
I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand

[Verse 3]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Bridge 2]
I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you

[Instrumental Verse: Guitar solo]

[Bridge 3]
I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand

[Verse 4]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Outro]
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle
