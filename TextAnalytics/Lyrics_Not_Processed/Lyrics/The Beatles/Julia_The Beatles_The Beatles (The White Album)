[Intro]
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

[Verse 1]
Julia, Julia
Ocean child calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

[Verse 2]
Julia, seashell eyes
Windy smile calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

[Bridge]
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
Glimmering in the sun

[Verse 3]
Julia, Julia
Morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

[Intro variant]
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

[Verse 4]
Julia, sleeping sand
Silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

[Verse 5]
Hmm hmm hmm
Calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia

[Outro]
Julia, Julia
