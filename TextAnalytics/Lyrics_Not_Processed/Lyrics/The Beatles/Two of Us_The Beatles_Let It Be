[Intro; John Lennon]
I Dig a Pygmy
 by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Two of us riding nowhere
, 
spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
, 
not arriving
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
, 
lifting latches
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Outro]
We're going home
Better believe it
Goodbye
