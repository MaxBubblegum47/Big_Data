[Verse 1]
Anna
You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him
Go with him

[Verse 2]
Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know, now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him

[Bridge]
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

[Verse 3]
Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him

[Bridge]
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
But let me tell you now
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leave me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

[Verse 4]
Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him

[Outro]
Go with him
You can go with him, girl
Go with him
