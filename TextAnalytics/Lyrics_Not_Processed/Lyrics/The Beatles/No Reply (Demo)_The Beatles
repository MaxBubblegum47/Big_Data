Control room: No reply, take one!
One two three four, one
This happened once before
When I came to your door no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light
I know that you saw me
Cause I looked up to see your face
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home that's a lie
Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door (your face)
I nearly died
Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
Your face
If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply
This happened once before (oh yeah)
When I came to your door no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through-- your face
