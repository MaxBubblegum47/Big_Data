What key is it in?
What key is it in?
It'll be in F, for you
Yesterday
I'm in G, but it'll be in F
And it goes E minor to A seventh to D minor
Ready
Here we go
Okay man

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
There's a shadow hanging over me
I'm not half the man I used to be
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
