All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do

Everything you need is here
And everything that's not here is not there
And if if there's something missing in this God almighty plan
Could it be you need a woman?

All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
Just swallow this that's all you gotta do

Everything you need is here
But everything that's not here is not there
And if there's something missing in this God almighty plan
Could it be you need a woman?

Well all you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do

Take three times a day after every meal

All you need to do is say this little word
I know it sounds absurd but it's true
The magic in the mantra will give you the answer
And swallow this that's all you gotta do
