[Verse 1]
This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face

[Verse 2]
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

[Bridge]
If I were you, I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

[Verse 2]
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

[Outro]
No reply, no reply
