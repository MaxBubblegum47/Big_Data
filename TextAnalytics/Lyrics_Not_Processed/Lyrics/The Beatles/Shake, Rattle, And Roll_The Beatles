Miscellaneous
Shake, Rattle, And Roll
Rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
Well you never do nothing
To save your doggone soul
Well get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said to my soul:
You're the devil in the frying pan
Well I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
Well you never do nothing
To save your doggone soul
