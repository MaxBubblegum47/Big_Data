[Verse 1: John Lennon and & Paul McCartney]
That boy took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry

[Verse 3: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

[Outro: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
This boy
This boy
This boy
