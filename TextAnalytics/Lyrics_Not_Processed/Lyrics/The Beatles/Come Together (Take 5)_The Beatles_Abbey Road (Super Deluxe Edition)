[Intro banter]
Ha ha. Stop!
Five
He shut his eyes and came out on "wear no shootballs"
(Don't worry if you don't get the vocal, just keep going)
Okay, sorry. Yes. I get very involved, ya know?
One, two, a-one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Here come old flat-top, he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
He's got to be a joker, he just do what he please

[Interlude]
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Look out!

[Verse 2]
He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you, you got to be free

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Interlude]
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Hey!

[Verse 3]
He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideburns, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knees
He hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me
Yeah

[Guitar Solo + Verse 1]
Hey! He comes--he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
He's got to be a joker, he just do what he please
Look out!
Hit me

[Outro banter]
He roller-coaster, he got early warnin'
He's got darus dookers
Yes
A man like him would have it
He's got teenage lyrics
He's got hot-rod baldie
I'm loosing my cool
