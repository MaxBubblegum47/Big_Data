[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on

[Verse 2]
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And when he gives it to her, she begins to sing

[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on

[Bridge]
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

[Verse 3]
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on

[Bridge]
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

[Verse 4]
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on

[Outro]
Ob-la-di-la-da
