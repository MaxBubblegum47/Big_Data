[Verse 1]
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

[Verse 2]
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away

[Verse 3]
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

[Chorus]
Try to realize it’s all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

[Outro]
