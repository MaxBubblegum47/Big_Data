[Verse 1]
You say yes, I say no
You say stop and I say go go go, oh no

[Chorus]
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

[Verse 2]
I say high, you say low
You say why and I say I don't know, oh no

[Chorus]
You say goodbye and I say hello
(Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye) Hello, hello
(Hello, goodbye) I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
(Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye) Hello, hello
(Hello, goodbye) I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
(Hello, goodbye)

[Bridge]
Why why why why why why do you say goodbye?
Goodbye, bye bye bye bye
Oh no

[Chorus]
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

[Verse 3]
You say yes (I say yes)
I say no (But I may mean no)
You say stop (I can stay)
And I say go go go (Till it's time to go)
Oh, oh no

[Chorus]
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, oh, oh
Hello
