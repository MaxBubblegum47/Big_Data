[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"

[Bridge 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"

[Bridge 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?
