[Verse 1]
When I see you, I just don't know what to say
I like to be with you every hour of the day

[Chorus]
So if you want me just like I need you
You know what to do

[Verse 2]
I watched you walking by, and you looked alone
I hope that you won't mind if I walk you back home

[Chorus]
And if you want me just like I need you
You know what to do

[Bridge]
Just call on me when you're lonely
I'll keep my love for you only
I'll call on you if I'm lonely too

[Verse 3]
Understand I'll stay with you every day
Make you love me more in every way

[Chorus]
So if you want me just like I want you
You know what to do

[Bridge]
Just call on me when you're lonely
I'll keep my love for you only
I'll call on you if I'm lonely too

[Verse 3]
Understand I'll stay with you every day
Make you love me more in every way

[Chorus]
So if you want me just like I want you
You know what to do
