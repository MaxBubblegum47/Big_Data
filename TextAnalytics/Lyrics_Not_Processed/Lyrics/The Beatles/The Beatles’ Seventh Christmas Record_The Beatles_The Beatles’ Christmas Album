Of course, turn towards eating.

Sanctuary.

Fortunate, lucky New Year. And a good time to be had by

Saw your place in the seventies?

(Y): Everybody will just be flying around, you know.

(J): Ah, everybody will just be flying around, you see. D'you
Understand that?

(Y): The air's so crisp and all that. And just, there's
Something about it, very delicate...

(J): (Singing)
Deep and crisp and even,
Brightly shone the moon that night
On the misty cruel.
Good King Wenceslas last look out
On the feast of....

Just slowing down the process of our thinking. Anyway,
It's just really beautiful.
