[Fade-In From Chorus]
Alright

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
Well, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

[Chorus]
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
All you can [?] anyhow

[Chorus]
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Outro]
