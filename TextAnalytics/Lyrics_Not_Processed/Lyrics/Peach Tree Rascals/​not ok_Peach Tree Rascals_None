[Intro]
Cause I don't feel much

[Chorus]
Now I'm so done
I don't wake up
I don't feel right
Cause I don't feel much
I don't feel much
Now I'm so done
I don't wanna wake up
Cause I don't feel alright
Cause I don't feel much
I don't feel much
I don't feel much

[Verse 1]
I was so broken down and hopeless out
Out on my own, I found nobody round
I was so dumb and down, I'm lost without
I was so gone without, I'm gone without
But I know that I can be the only one
Running around, got my weed, I'm rolling up
With no one to bother me, It's only up
With no one to bother me, It's only up

[Chorus]
Now I'm so done
I don't wake up
I don't feel right
Cause I don't feel much
I don't feel much
Now I'm so done
I don't wanna wake up
Cause I don't feel alright
Cause I don't feel much
I don't feel much
I don't feel much

[Verse 2]
I just woke up on the floor
Cold as hell, I need a bed
Practice for the show, picture bullets in my head
If they take me to county for some shit inside my bag
Tell my mama I love her, I'll be back before the 10th
And I never could shut out all the self doubt in my head
And I never could forget all the shit I should have said
And I'm overthinking thinking, over everything I know
Eyes is frozen, keep em closed
Pillows covered over up
Thinkin' of mama, start tearing up, half a bottle and I feel the buzz
Her and daddy, they splittin' up
Younger brother, adopt a son
I support my baby bruh
I just wanna see 31
Speak to Issac when I was young
Tell them that this shit ain't

[Chorus]
Done
I don't wake up
I don't feel right
Cause I don't feel much
I don't feel much
Now I'm so done
I don't wanna wake up
Cause I don't feel alright
Cause I don't feel much
I don't feel much
I don't feel much
