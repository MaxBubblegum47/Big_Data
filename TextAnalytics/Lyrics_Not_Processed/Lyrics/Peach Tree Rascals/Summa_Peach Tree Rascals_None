[Verse 1]
Sho, I'm a runna if you wanna

Go, Dumb and Dumba
When I'm off da dro
Gotta Gotta, get my guap up
'Sho, Tell my momma that I'm goin out

After that a platinum plaque
We gon' put it on the wall
Life a movie and it feel like we
Be sittin' middle row
Only do this for my brothers

[Bridge]
All my days are right
Live for summer nights
I feel the breeze in summertime
(Summertime, summertime, summertime)
All my days are right
Live for summer nights

(Summertime, summertime, summertime)
Ah, the feeling's gettin' greater
From a little piece of paper
Givin' life a different flavor, oh

[Chorus]
Trippin' on my mind, Ima ride on a wave
Lookin' like the sun's gonna pass on away
I been trippin' through the summa
Turnin' nights into days
In the summa, what a color
Trippin' on my mind, Ima ride on a wave
Lookin' like the sun's gonna pass on away
I been trippin' through the summa
Turnin' nights into days
In the summa, what a color
Oh, ah
Oh, ah, ooh
Oh, ah
Oh, ah, ooh
