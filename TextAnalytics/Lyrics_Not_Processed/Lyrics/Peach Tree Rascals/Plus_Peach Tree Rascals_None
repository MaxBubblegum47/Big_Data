[Verse 1]
Woke up feelin' so cold
I don’t wanna go no more
I don't wanna learn no code
In a class, didn't pass so I dipped home
I just wanna feel somethin’
I just wanna feel your skin
Missin' them days you went
To my crib down the street

[Pre-Chorus]
There's something about this windin' road
All on your own, I'm cruisin' slow
And if I ever lose control
What's wrong is wrong, you told me so

[Chorus]
Winter came quick, that shit not fair
Hoodie on so I don't fix my hair
Videos, I still feel you there
Every night you are not in my bed
Money come slow, that shit not fair
Take a deep breath, we’re in mountains
It’s a cold world, motherfuckers don't care at all, at all

[Verse 2]
Don’t fill my cup, I can't take much
I'm so in love, I can't give up
I fall so high, I don’t know why
I fall so high, I fall so
No, I don't feel the same
When worlds just fade to grey
We always tend to stray from what we got
Strawberry lemonade to sweeten up my days
We always tend to stray from what we got

[Verse 3]
Gun is on safety, scared I won't make it
Too far gone, I'm gone so don't save me
One step more, I'm off it, don't wake me up
I just rolled up
And even when the school shit starts to slow up
I'm hoping that my dad's love never froze up
My brother mix lean with the lemon soda
We keep growing apart as we getting older
And how I'm gon' change if I ain't change yet
I'll still be the same if I'm famous
I'll still be the one to help out sometimes
Even with darkness all on my mind, mama I
Sometimes, I'm down on my self
Sometimes, I think they can't tell
Sometimes, neglecting my health
Sunrise, I'm loving myself
Sometimes, I'm down on my self
Sometimes, I think they can't tell
Sometimes, neglecting my health
Sunrise, I'm loving myself

[Pre-Chorus]
There's something about this windin' road
All on your own, I'm cruisin' slow
And if I ever lose control
What's wrong is wrong, you told me so

[Chorus]
Winter came quick, that shit not fair
Hoodie on so I don't fix my hair
Videos, I still feel you there
Every night you are not in my bed
Money come slow, that shit not fair
Take a deep breath, we're in mountains
It's a cold world, motherfuckers don't care at all, at all

[Post-Chorus]
Losing my way, but they can never cloud my shine
My shine away, fly away
Losing my way, but they can never cloud my shine
My shine away, fly away
Losing my way, but they can never cloud my shine
My shine away, fly away

[Outro]
Drivin' through unknown
Only I know where I'll go
I can't feel no way no more
Drivin' through unknown
Only I know where I'll go
I can't feel no way no more
Drivin' through unknown
Only I know where I'll go
I can't feel no way no more
