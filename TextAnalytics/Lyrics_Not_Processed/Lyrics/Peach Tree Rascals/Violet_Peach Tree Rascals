[Intro: Issac and with Tarrek]
Don't, don't fall asleep
I'll be okay, just give me a week
Losing my feet, losing my dreams
I've been OT, not OTC
Please let me speak, please let me go
I'll let you fly all on your own
You don't rely on me no more
It's just a sign, I guess I'll go
Don't, don't fall asleep
I'll be okay, just give me a week
Losing my feet, losing my dreams
I've been OT, not OTC
Please let me speak, please let me go
I'll let you fly all on your own
You don't rely on me no more
It's just a sign, I guess I'll go

[Verse 1: Tarrek]
I did nothing wrong
I've been writing songs
I've been stuck in waves
I've been holding on
I think it's time I let you go
'Cause I've been holding on and waiting for too long
And I don't know if I can take this
Get up in the morning
I'm feeling pretty low
I grab coffee and a cigarette
Then it's time to hit the road
I've been spending all my time
Dreaming 'bout the one I want
In a world of my own
I can't leave the thought alone


Lately I feel like I've lost myself
And I cannot deny the changes that I've
Lately I feel like I've lost myself
And I cannot deny the changes that I've

[Verse 2: Tarrek]
Lately I've been falling back in silence
My heart just stopped the fighting
Said that's enough for me
I lost the point in trying
I'm living under trees
I've grown up to loving, now I'm numb, you see
I forgot about you but you remember me
Still remember 'bout us and all our history
I can't take the thought of you up and out my mind
Stuck inside my head, now I think it's time

[Refrain: Tarrek]
I think it's time I let you go
'Cause I've been holding on and waiting for too long
And I don't know if I can take this

[Verse 3: Joseph]
Shoulda cast away, I've been evading you
At times like this I wish I coulda shut the door on you
I know it hurts to stay, the bells all ring the same
You said you love me but don't trust me that I'll do the same
Running away, need a vacay
Away from this place, don't hate me
I'm losing my faith, the birds all flew away
My heart ain't the same, don't hate me
No words to say, I'm washing away
Just like a stain, don't hate me
Letting you go, canâ€™t fight it no more
I'll be alone, don't hate me

[Bridge]

[Outro: Joseph and Tarrek]
Inside my dreams I can see you with me
If I wake up too soon I'll fall right back asleep
Inside my dreams I can see you with me
If I wake up too soon I'll fall right back asleep
Inside my dreams I can see you with me
If I wake up too soon I'll fall right back asleep
Inside my dreams I can see you with me
If I wake up too soon I'll fall right back asleep
