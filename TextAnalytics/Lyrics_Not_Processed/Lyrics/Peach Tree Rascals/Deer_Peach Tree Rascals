[Chorus]
I'm in need of some love today
It can't seem to roll my way
I've felt like I'm rollin' on roller skates
I'm in need of some love today
It can't seem to roll my way
I've felt like I'm rollin' on roller skates

[Verse 1]
Wrong way, I waited for nothin'
Slowly, I know that it's comin'
I'm holdin', closely, you know me
I'm Stoney, I can't be so lonely
I'll wait 'til I'm down and under
I'll stay in lightning and thunder
Somethin' about it, I found it
Around it, I can't live without it

[Chorus]
I'm in need of some love today
It can't seem to roll my way
I've felt like I'm rollin' on roller skates

[Verse 2]
Wastin', I feel like agrarian
Darlin', I know that I'm tired of ya
I'm hopin' you give me just one night
My whole life, I've waited for your light
I'll take the bags off your shoulders
Day-drink, a life gettin' older
I'm hopin' you give me just one night
Your whole life, you waited for my lights

[Chorus]
I'm in need of some love today
It can't seem to roll my way
I've felt like I'm rollin' on roller skates

[Bridge]
I been all alone and I know
You've been on my mind, and I can't
Get this off my chest, and it goes
On and on and on and on

[Outro]
Found you in my dreams
Rollin' next to me
Holdin' on my hands
Hopin' this would never end, no
Found you in my dreams
Rollin' next to me
Holdin' on my hands
Hopin' this would never end, no
