[Verse 1: Tarrek]
Don't wanna be so afraid
It's time to get out my way
I'm running I can't keep running
I'm running I can't keep running
I've been seeing a haze
Just wish it was just a phase
I'm running I can't keep running
I'm running I can't keep running
Feeling it more and more
Like everything's going wrong
There's something there's always something
Something there's always something
Never gone have control
I'm better off letting go
There's something there's always something

[Pre-Chorus: Joseph]
It's a game all the way we keep running away
It's the same every day it'll always be me

[Chorus: Joseph]
I'm just staring at the stars tryna find my way
When things don't go my way
When things don't go my way
When things don't go my way
When things don't go my way
When things don't go my way

[Verse 2: Issac]
In the back of the paddywagon 16
Right after selling ounce of blue dream
Cops pulled up expecting some P's
Had 2 grams on us, bitch please
I got enemies I don't know about
Couple old friends still stuck in jail
They was totin' them poles like show and tell
I was stuck in my zone stuck in the house
And I think about the days when my brother went to jail
I was sittin with my dad
Auntie had to pay the bail
Uncle had to take the gun
Still wonder where he went
Either way it goes still is what it is
No control of this life we live
No control in this life we own
If we did then we'd still be kids
Ridding round on our bicycles

[Chorus: Joseph]
I'm just staring at the stars tryna find my way
When things don't go my way
When things don't go my way
When things don't go my way
When things don't go my way
I'm just staring at the stars tryna find my way
