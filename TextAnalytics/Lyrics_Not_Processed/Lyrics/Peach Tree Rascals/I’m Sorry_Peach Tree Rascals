[Verse 1: Tarrek Abdel-Khaliq]
Take my car and I hit the road
Watch the trees and I smoke my dro for hours
Gone for hours (Woo)
Sing my songs when I'm on my own
Tears come down and I feel my soul for hours
For hours (Woo, woo)

[Pre-Chorus: Tarrek Abdel-Khaliq]
And you get no say
How I live my days
How I take my pain
I got everything I need
Everything
And I can't complain
I've been on my way
I got everything
I got everything I need
Everything (Woo, woo)

[Chorus: Joseph Barros]
Hold my pride when I go outside
Tell my mama I'll be home on time
Come on (Come on, come on)
Mmm, come on (Come on, come on)
Wash my soul, all the drugs I did
Can't go back to the place I've been
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

[Verse 2: Issac Pech & Tarrek]
I've been away too long
I've been away too long
Leavin' my phone at home today (Today, today)
And I'vе been a stray too long
I've been a stray too long
I just wanna feel at home today (Today, today)
And my baby don't love me no more
I'm waking up early, it's the sound of my phone
I'm hopin' it's a text from the girl that I want (Everything)
Even though I know for a fact that it's not
Baby, can you sing to me when I feel low?
Can you make a painting, watercolor?
I wish I was home today
I'd hold your face

[Chorus: Joseph Barros]
Hold my pride when I go outside
Tell my mama I'll be home on time
Come on (Come on)
Mmm, come on (Come on, woo!)
Wash my soul, all the drugs I did
Can't go back to the place I’ve been
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

[Outro]
I said come on
(Come on, come on)
I said come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on, come on (Uh, ooh)
I said come on, I said come on
Come on, come on, come on (Come on, come on, come on)
I said come on, I said come on (Come on)
Come on, come on, come on (Woo!)
I said come on, I said come on
Come on, come on, come on
I said come on
