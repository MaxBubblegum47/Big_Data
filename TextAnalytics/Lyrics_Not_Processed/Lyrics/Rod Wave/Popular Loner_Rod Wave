[Intro]
(Pipe that shit up, TnT)
I don't know, like
I just don't, I don't get people (D. Major, baby)
I don't fuck with nobody, I don't be around nobody
I just like being dolo, you know?
People, I don't know, I just don't understand 'em
Maybe it's they don't understand me

[Chorus]
Weight of the world on your shoulders and you're feeling all alone
You got it, my nigga, just hold on
Thug life ain't dead, I'ma be this way until they kill me
'Til then, I'ma make these niggas feel me
My nigga it's a wild, wild lifestyle
A wild, wild lifestyle
I don't get along with my peers, I'm at war with myself
So fuck you and everybody else

[Verse]
Okay, I finally get the meaning of fighting demons (Fighting demons)
Late at night, I ain't sleeping, I'm up thinking (I'm up thinking)
I'ma ball all season for last season (Yeah, yeah)
Back when I was on the bleachers, they left me needin' (Yeah)
Thug life ain't dead, niggas scared, that's how I feel (I feel)
I don't fuck with my peers, never did, and never will (I never will)
And I can't keep a bitch 'cause I be peepin' shit
I ain't with all of that beefin' shit, I'd rather leave a bitch
In the city, brought my glizzy with me, I'll delete a bitch
Niggas hating on a daily, but be on some feature shit, leecher shit
Niggas mad at me but I can't understand 'em
How you mad at me and I'm tryna feed my family?
And my school didn't feel like high school 'cause niggas fake
So I would skip classes and break in houses to get paid
Told my mama one day, one day, I'ma be straight
Stack up my chips and I'ma move far away

[Chorus]
Weight of the world on your shoulders and you're feeling all alone
You got it, my nigga, just hold on
Thug life ain't dead, I'ma be this way until they kill me
'Til then, I'ma make these niggas feel me
My nigga it's a wild, wild lifestyle
A wild, wild lifestyle
I don't get along with my peers, I'm at war with myself
So fuck you and everybody else

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You know, I'm a popular loner, you know
Maybe it's me, maybe it's not, you know, maybe it's me
Fuck it
