[Intro]
Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy, that's probably Tago
Yeah, yeah

Mmh, yeah

[Verse]
She say, 'Why you thug me like that?'
I don't mean to
Sometimes I feel like I don't need you
Unlike other people, I done been here twice before
So I know how the dices roll
So many times I had the chance to tell the truth and played you
So many times you could've went and did you, but was faithful
That's why I wanna thank you and then give you the best of me
I can't take back the past but I got the recipe
Let's jump on a plane, see the world together
Give you my last name, be my girl forever
They see the Instagram, the comments, and all the likes
But they don't see the make-up, and the breakups, and the fights
It's a cold, cold world, it's a wild, wild life
But long as I got you, girl, I'm alright
In the middle of the day, at the end of the night
Believe me, I'm right by your side
So if you need me, you can call me
I'll be running for you, darling
Whatever it is, whatever you need
I'll come full speed, guaranteed to...

[Chorus]
Paint the sky red only for you
Paint the sky red only for you
Paint the sky red for you
Paint the sky red, yeah

[Outro]
Only for you
For you
Yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, yeah, grrah
