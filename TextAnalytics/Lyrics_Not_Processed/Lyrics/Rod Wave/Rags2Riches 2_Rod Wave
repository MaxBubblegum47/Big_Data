[Intro: Rod Wave]
(Ayy, Zypitano got that gas)
(Six, chill, fool, for real, for real)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Rod Wave]
We went from rags to riches (Yeah)
Project fences to livin' luxury
Now we live luxury
Straight out that bottom, nobody gave nothing to me
Be careful while fucking with me
All of my lil' brothers 'bout it, they cuttin' for me
Yeah, they gon' cut you for me
Lay in the cut with them cutters and cut you for free
Say she in love with me (What else?)
But save your love, I just want your company (Pray 4 Love)
I fall in the club for free
I give out daps and them hugs, but no one's for me
'Cause that type of shit don't faze a player, uh (What else?)
This type of shit is what make a hater

[Pre-Chorus: Rod Wave]
When you got it out the mud, yeah
Ran it up, yeah
Really don't give no fuck, yeah
Don't give no fuck
When you turn nothing to something, yeah
Really hustlin', yeah
Young and gettin' that money, yeah
We gettin' that money, yeah

[Chorus: Rod Wave]
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches, mmm
Rags to riches (Damn)
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
To riches (Damn)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I went from rags to riches
I still go back to the trenches
We had to smash some niggas
No silver spoons, we had plastic utensils
He just came home, he still packin' his pistol
Die in these streets or get saved by the system
Or get you some millions, my lifestyle is vicious
These hoes ain't gon' miss you
They fuck on your partner, act like they forgot you, that shit have you sick
My girl, she the realest, I know how to pick 'em
I know what I did, I need you to bear with me
I know shit get ugly, but that's why you pretty
And pushin' a Bentley, my kind near extinct
I put up them millions, I'll never go broke
I'm a god in my hood, I give everyone hope
Can't remember a time when my answer was nope
I remember the times I had nowhere to go
Down to my lowest, I turned to a pro
And I'm pourin' my heart out, I bought my lil' boy house
I brought all the bros out, I never try show out
I'm never gon' go out, never that
Every time that I turn around, I'm giving back
Once they whack him, he's dead, it ain't no gettin' back
I was giving my all, not asking for it back
I had blue hearts at first, I had to turn 'em black

[Chorus: Rod Wave]
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches, mmm
Rags to riches (Damn)
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
To riches (Damn)

[Interlude: Rod Wave]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rags to riches, rags to riches
Rags to riches, rags to riches, rags to riches

[Chorus: Rod Wave]
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches, mmm
Rags to riches (Damn)
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
Rags to riches
To riches (Damn)
