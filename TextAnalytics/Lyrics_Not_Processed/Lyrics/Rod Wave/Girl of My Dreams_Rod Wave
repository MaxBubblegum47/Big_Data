[Chorus]
And I know you're not no good for me, but

The girl of my dreams, yeah, uh
She looks like the girl of my
She looks like the girl of my
She looks like the girl of my dreams, yeah
She looks like the girl of my
She looks like the girl of my, yeah (Okay)

[Verse]
Devil in a dress, angel in some Nike Airs
I could've sworn I went to sleep and she was right here
Don't know if I seen her in my dreams or my nightmares
Think it was my nightmares
And I think I need your love, I don't need no one selfish
Wonder if I give this girl my heart, could she help it?
And you know she's an angel if you let her tell it
Baby hot as hell, she got kicked out of heaven
You know I love them braces, them big lips, that red skin
You know I love the faces she make when we sexing
Can't get her off my mind if I tried, my obsession
Block both her numbers, erased all our texts, yeah

[Chorus]
I know you're not no good for me, but
You look so good to me, yeah
I don't need another broken heart or sleepless night
God, please guide me right, she looks like
The girl of my dreams, yeah (Ace Lex got a full one)
You look like the girl of my
You look like the girl of my, yeah
And I know you're not no good for me, but
You look so good to me, yeah
I don't need another broken heart or sleepless night
God, please guide me right, she looks like
The girl of my dreams, yeah, uh (Ace Lex got a full one)
She looks like the girl of my
She looks like the girl of my
She looks like the girl of my dreams
