[Intro]
We got London on da Track

[Verse 1]
I been all in my phone, I got options
And I don't wanna tell you to drop it
But I don't wanna play unfair, yeah, yeah
Somethin' that makes me look at you too often
And baby, you can give it somethin'
Baby, I can run overtime, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm talkin' crazy
I need you right in my space, but I
Need it, baby, I'm late, but I
Still can check in with you
I know that I need my friend, but I
Wouldn't wanna leave you, no, oh, I
Wouldn't wanna plead
But my heart, my mind and my body is sayin' (Sayin', sayin')
My mind, my mind, and my body is
My body is sayin' (Sayin', sayin')
My mind, my mind, and my heart
My body is sayin'

[Verse 2]
I don't know what it is
I can't tell you what it is
But you got me goin' crazy
Sex with you is so amazin'
How, how long can you go, baby?
Better last 'til my body's sore, 'cause it's crazy

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm talkin' crazy
I need you right in my space, but I
Need it, baby, I'm late, but I
Still can check in with you
I know that I need my friend, but I
Wouldn't wanna leave you, no, oh, I
Wouldn't wanna plead
But my heart, my mind and my body is sayin' (Sayin', sayin')
My mind, my mind, and my body is
My body is sayin' (Sayin', sayin')
My mind, my mind, and my heart
My body is sayin'

[Outro]
I know, oh, I
I know, oh, I
I know we ain't gotta talk, alright
I know you ain't gotta talk, alright
Baby, I, I just wanna talk to you
I just wanna talk to you
Don't this shit, don't this shit
Know that we did, oh
