[Verse 1]
Threw away your love letters
I thought it'd make me feel better
I finally got you out my bed
But I still can't get you out my head, ooh
I'm sending you one text at a time
I know you're by your phone
So boy pick up your line
And I ain’t too proud to beg
So what's been said has been said

[Chorus]
And I need you to know
You don't know what love is
And I need you to know, you don't know

[Verse 2]
And you don't know what love is
If you don't put up a fight
You don't know what love is
If you don't stay up all night, crying
You don't know what love is
If you’re too good to call a million times
And you say you know what love is
But I swear you never seen it in your life, ooh

[Outro]
I swear you never seen it in your life
I swear you never seen it in your life
