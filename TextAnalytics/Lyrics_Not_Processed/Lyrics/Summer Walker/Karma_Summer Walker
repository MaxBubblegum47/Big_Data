[Intro]
I told you, you better stay prayed up
You never thought the universe be looking for revenge

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't keep just doing them girls like that
Thinking that nobody finna bite back
Losing your mind baby
Can't be sure, time's wasting

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, I'm sorry
I'm just here to do my job
Nice to meet you, no running
Please don't fear me, I'm just karma

[Verse]
Let me dance for you, I'm sorry
You'll wanna love me strong, then I'm gone
This feeling's just for you and your wrongs
I am just here to do my job
Devil in disguise, oh
Dressed in all white, swear you so down
Think I'm supposed to ride, oh
You done told me I should be the only one around
Talking 'bout you'll make it my way
Made it my-, made it my way
Think I gotta run, boy, you don't wanna be telling me
Take me to your momma house
I'm sorry if you never doubted me
But you should've doubted
('Cause I told you, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause, don't you know you can't be doing them girls like that?
Thinking that nobody finna bite back
Losing your mind baby
Can't be sure, time's wasting

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, I'm sorry
I'm just here to do my job
Nice to meet you, then sudden
I reveal you, I'm just karma

[Bridge]
Let me dance for you, I'm sorry
Do you wanna love me strong, then I'm gone
This feeling, what we have, then it stops
I am just here to do my job
Do my job, oh-oh, yeah
Do my job

[Outro]
Oh woah, oh oh oh
Oh woah, oh oh oh
Oh woah, oh oh oh
Yeah, yeah, oh
