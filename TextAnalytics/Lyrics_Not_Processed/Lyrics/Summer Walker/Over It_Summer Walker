Am I really that much to handle?
Breakin' these niggas down like enamel (Oh)
Yet I'm ready to blow you out like a candle
Can I really just blow you out like a candle?
You a man, you say you the man (Oh)
You say you 'bout it, you say you got it planned (Oh)
I really wasn't tryna listen
You say I ain't got no discipline (Oh)
And that there why I wasn't listenin' (Oh)

[Verse 2]
But I need a nigga who can handle me (Oh)
I want a, a nigga who can handle me, oh
Nigga keep your hands off me
You wanna stay with me
But nigga, you just a fan of me (Fan of me)
Cuff your bitch, nigga
Nigga, cuff your bitch
Caught you slippin' and a nigga hit a lick on you
Are you really tellin' me that...
I could break you down like a gym, sweat

[Verse 3]
Fuck it and catch me at V-Live
I'll be sippin' D'USSE 'til I dizzy
Actin' like he care, he just don't decide
I be tryna numb the pain, I be so hizzigh (Oh)
Fuck it, you can catch me in the Hills (Oh)
Watch me close 'cause I'll be poppin' pills (Oh, oh)
All I ask for you to keep it trill (Oh)
All I ask for you to keep it real, real, real, real, real

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Real, real, trill, keep one hunnid, oh no
Not too much emotion, no, no
You know I been fucked up, yeah, yeah
