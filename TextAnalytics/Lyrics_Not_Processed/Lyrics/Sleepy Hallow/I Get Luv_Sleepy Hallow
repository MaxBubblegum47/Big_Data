[Intro]
Great John on the beat, by the way
So they fuck with it

[Chorus]
I get love in my city I know them niggas hate
All black when I’m getting busy just pray I beat the case
Fall back no you wasn’t with me I wasn’t getting paid
Ran up them 100s & 50s tryna blow a bag a day
Them niggas stealing my style can’t take my swag away
That choppa blowin’ him down if he get in my way
Got locked up I held it down & kept my niggas safe
I put that Glock on that clown you should’ve seen his face

[Verse]
Look, I know the difference, I could be goofy or be militant
That choppa knockin’ off his ligaments I’m bout’ to shit again
I’m tryna count me up 100 bands my shooters hoppin’ out of sprinter vans
Free Caesar out the can, no he don’t do it for no instagram
My niggas truer than that Buddha man
(Free Caesar out the can, no he don’t do it for no, mmm
My niggas truer than that Buddha man)
They fell in love with it so they fuck with it
Die bout’ this money if you want nigga it come get it
And you get shot up with them niggas & we ain’t missin’
And you be treeshin’ lil bitch so we ain’t kissin’
Look, money long stand tall like it’s Blake Griffin
Put my niggas on in this song we gon’ make chicken
(money long stand tall like it’s Blake Griffin
Put my niggas on in this song we gon’ make chicken)

[Chorus 2]
I get love in my city I know them niggas hate
All black when I’m getting busy just pray I beat the case
Fall back no you wasn’t with me I wasn’t getting paid
Ran up them 100s & 50s tryna blow a bag a day
(Ran up them 100s & 50s tryna blow a bag a day, Ran up them 100s & 50s tryna blow a bag a day, Ran up them 100s & 50s tryna blow a bag a day)
Stop it right there
