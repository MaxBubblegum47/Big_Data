[Verse 1: Buck Dharma]
Parched land, no desert sand, the sun is just a dot
And a little bit of water goes a long way 'cause (It's hot...)
Three good buddies were laughin’ and smokin’
In the back of a rented Ford
They couldn't know they weren't going far
Each one with the money in his pocket
To go out and buy himself a brand new car
But they all held the money they had
Money they hoped would take them very far

[Verse 2: Buck Dharma]
Sky’s bright, the traffic light, now and then a truck
And they hadn't seen a cop around all day (What luck...)
They brought everything they needed
Bags and scales to weigh the stuff
The driver said, "The border's just over the bluff"
It wasn't until the car suddenly stopped
In the middle of a cold and barren plain
And the other guy turned and spilled
Three boys' blood, did they know a trap had been laid?

[Outro: Buck Dharma]
They’re okay, the last days of May, but I’ll be breathin’ dry air
I’m leaving soon, the others are already there (All there...)
Wouldn’t be interested in coming along instead of staying here?
It’s said the West is nice this time of year, that’s what they say
