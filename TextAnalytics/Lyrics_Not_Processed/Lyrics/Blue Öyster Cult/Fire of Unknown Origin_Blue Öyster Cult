[Verse 1: Eric Bloom]
Death comes sweepin' through the hallway
Like a lady's dress
Death comes drivin' down the highway
In its Sunday best

[Chorus: Eric Bloom]
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away

[Verse 2: Eric Bloom]
Swept her up and off my wavelength
Swallowed her up
Like the ocean in a fire
So thick and grey

[Chorus: Eric Bloom]
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away

[Bridge]
Wuh uh...
Wuh uh...

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Eric Bloom]
Death comes driving, I can't do nothing!
Death goes
There must be something, there must be something
That remains

[Bridge]
There must be something, there must be something

[Chorus: Eric Bloom]
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby, took my baby away...
