[Verse 1: Eric Bloom]
Junkies down in Brooklyn are going crazy
They're laughing just like hungry dogs in the street
Policemen are hiding behind the skirts of little girls
Their eyes have turned the color of frozen meat

[Chorus: Eric Bloom & Albert Bouchard]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no, no, no, no
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave

[Verse 2: Eric Bloom]
Catholic school girls have thrown away their mascara
They chain themselves to the axles of Big Mack trucks
The sky is filled with herds of shivering angels
The fat lady laughs: "Gentlemen, start your trucks"

[Chorus: Eric Bloom & Albert Bouchard]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no, no, no, no
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave

[Bridge: Eric Bloom]
(Christina)
(Mother's home) No, no, no, no
(Christina) No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Come to mother) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Christina) No, no, no, no, no-no, no, no, no

[Chorus/Outro: Eric Bloom & Albert Bouchard]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no, no, no, no
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen
