[Verse 1: Eric Bloom]
You see me now, a veteran of a thousand psychic wars
I've been livin' on the edge so long where the winds of limbo roar
And I'm young enough to look at and far too old to see
All the scars are on the inside
I'm not sure that there's anything left to me (Me)

[Chorus: Eric Bloom]
Don't let these shakes go on, it's time we had a break from it
It's time we had some leave
We've been livin' in the flames, we've been eatin' up our brains
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on

[Verse 2: Eric Bloom]
You ask me why I'm weary, why I can't speak to you
You blame me for my silence, say it's time I changed and grew
But the war's still going on, dear, and there's no end that I know
And I can't say if we're ever
I can't say if we're ever gonna be free (Free)

[Chorus: Eric Bloom]
Don't let these shakes go on, it's time we had a break from it
It's time we had some leave
We've been living in the flames, we've been eating up our brains
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Eric Bloom]
You see me now, a veteran of a thousand psychic wars
My energy's spent at last and my armor is destroyed
I have used up all my weapons and I'm helpless and bereaved
Wounds are all I'm made of
Did I hear you say that this is victory?

[Chorus: Eric Bloom]
Don't let these shakes go on, it's time we had a break from it
Send me to the rear
Where the tides of madness swell and been sliding into hell
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on

[Outro: Eric Bloom]
Don't let these shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on
