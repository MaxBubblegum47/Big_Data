Shawty sweet, Krispy Kreme
Money long,  No Limousine

Too many racks up in my jeans
You know I got in for free wit da team
Hit from da back I’m breaking ha spleen

Verse:
.. ooh airing it out
.. yo bitch is starin, clout
.. jewler just lit up my mouf
I’m in LA but I came from da souf
.. I don’t wanna fuck so she pout
.. yo party is dry issa drought
.. I’m dogging that bitch imma mount
This not my city but I run the town
She just popped a bean now she gone
Mark Henry gas bitch it’s strong
Smoking wood roaches out da bong
Feel like Uzi cause my money long
Hood rich imma water boy
Pull off inna foreign Issa toy
Shout out all my fam in Illinois
That bitch fishy I ain’t talking Koi

Verse 2: (East20Baby)
Imma real demon just ask about me
Beat in her back then I’m back to the trap
Bad lil bitch keep her face in my lap
Smoking on _____ turn his ass to a pack
That 4 shit some hoe shit
_____ so potent (damn)
Nigga try to play imma shoot him in the face
Ride through LA and I keep me a Drake
Price on his head Issa bonus for his face
20 racks on me it’s more in my safe
Come here lil baby lemme fuck on your face
Knew you was a thot I fucked first day
Bust in her mouth and I pull on her lace
Beating your back while you arching your waist
You hoes and shit and I knew y’all was swoops
Who gone fuck first just like duck duck goose
