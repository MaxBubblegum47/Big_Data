Talkin' to myself and feelin' old
Sometimes I'd like to quit, nothin' ever seems to fit
Hangin' around, nothin' to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
What I've got they used to call the blues
Nothin' is really wrong, feelin' like I don't belong
Walkin' around, some kind of lonely clown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Funny, but it seems I always wind up here with you
Nice to know somebody loves me
Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me
(The one who loves me)
What I feel has come and gone before
No need to talk it out (Talk it out)
We know what it's all about
Hangin' around (Hangin' around)
Nothin' to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
(Only thing to do)
Run and find the one who loves me (Ooo)
What I feel has come and gone before
No need to talk it out (Talk it out)
We know what it's all about
Hangin' around (Hangin' around)
Nothin' to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down
Hangin' around (Hangin' around)
Nothin' to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get
Me down
