[Intro: King Von]
(Yo, Ayo)
(JTK)
Huh (These niggas know me for real)
What? (For real)
Von

[Chorus: King Von]
Rob who? Take what? You tweakin'
I said it was war, lil' nigga, I mean it
I done got out the floor, who got shot? I don't know
Headshots up close, lil' nigga, I seened it
Gun got dirty, lil' nigga, I cleaned it
.45 Glock on the bottom where the beam is
If a nigga move foul then we aiming where his team is
Sitting lil' niggas down, motherfucker, you ain't mean it
Get caught, just stick to the code
Got some niggas locked up and they know what they know
My homie lost trial, he'll be gone for a while
If he give up me then they letting him go
He won't be back on the streets 'til he old
Everyone that he love, they gon' be gone
I know some niggas that's quick to give police a tip
But my nigga, he never folded

[Verse 1: Polo G]
I don't really give a fuck what the blog said, too official to clear up a rumor
My homie laugh hard, heard an opp was dead, guess he got a killer's sense of humor
I heard that pussy been thinking 'bout death, well that bullet gon' stick to his mind like a tumor
Catch him and change him, look how they played him, he only gangster up on his computer
He played foul and we gave him a pass, that don't mean we won't get on your ass in the future
And I won't trip when my lil' brother clutching, know how he put in that work with that Ruger
My sneakers Louboutin, these ain't Puma's
I got a low end ho, she a booster
Nut on her face and I call her an Uber
He saving these hoes like his first name was Super
Now it's time to ride, is you ready or what?
Caught a few homicides now they ain't letting up
Thirteen hundred shots when we ride in them trucks
Get on any side and we fucking you up
I used to trap with the gangsters and clucks
Straight in the slums where they praying for luck
Like I'm Giannis, I play for them bucks
Hood on my back and I came in it clutch, bitch

[Chorus: King Von]
Rob who? Take what? You tweakin'
I said it was war, lil' nigga, I mean it
I done got out the floor, who got shot? I don't know
Headshots up close, lil' nigga, I seened it
Gun got dirty, lil' nigga, I cleaned it
.45 Glock on the bottom where the beam is
If a nigga move foul then we aiming where his team is
Sitting lil' niggas down, motherfucker, you ain't mean it
Get caught, just stick to the code
Got some niggas locked up and they know what they know
My homie lost trial, he'll be gone for a while
If he give up me then they letting him go
He won't be back on the streets 'til he old
Everyone that he love, they gon' be gone
I know some niggas that's quick to give police a tip
But my nigga, he never folded

[Verse 2: King Von]
I got my first hundred thou' and I broke it down
With my team, boy, I am so goated
I always stuck out when I'm in the crowd when I was a child
I was special and my mama noticed
That nigga cool, but Von, he the coldest
I live my life like a book and I wrote it
I drop a song then these niggas quote it
If he looking for me, I'm probably where his ho is
Only fuck bitches that's bad, ain't got no kids
I'm going crazy like I ain't got no sense
You in that car and that bitch ain't got no tint
We pulling up and we letting off four knicks
Don't need cap credit we giving out facelifts
He breathing hard, don't think he gon' make it
I chopped the block up and ain't have my face mask
So I'ma stay in, that's how my day end
Say he a heavy, we see at the weigh-in
He want a song or a verse, gotta pay then
Don't see me stopping, don't know where my brakes is
Only want blues, man Iâ€™m starting to get racist
Shit be getting real in that field and them chases
Can't go back now, I got too many cases
You don't look for me and see too many faces
Nigga, you in the way, and bitch, I'm your replacement

[Chorus: King Von]
Rob who? Take what? You tweakin'
I said it was war, lil' nigga, I mean it
I done got out the floor, who got shot? I don't know
Headshots up close, lil' nigga, I seened it
Gun got dirty, lil' nigga, I cleaned it
.45 Glock on the bottom where the beam is
If a nigga move foul then we aiming where his team is
Sitting lil' niggas down, motherfucker, you ain't mean it
Get caught, just stick to the code
Got some niggas locked up and they know what they know
My homie lost trial, he'll be gone for a while
If he give up me then they letting him go
He won't be back on the streets 'til he old
Everyone that he love, they gon' be gone
I know some niggas that's quick to give police a tip
But my nigga, he never folded
