[Intro]
DJ on the beat so it's a banger

[Chorus: King Von]
I'm like fuck it, I ain't ducking, if it's war, it's bustin'
You claim this shit but ain't outside, boy, we on your cousin
Heard your OG just got married, boy, we on her husband
Hope you niggas brought your guns 'cause we brought a dozen
See, I be thirsty, I be lurking, I'm a savage with it
It's levels to this drilling shit and I'm not average with it
I put my eyes on a nigga, then I'm bound to get him
I catch your ass up in that ocean, then you drownin' with him

[Verse 1: JusBlow600]
Like fuck it, it's bustin', one of my opps my cousin
I tell him stay up out the way, he with them opps, I'm uppin'
I'm uppin' then dumpin', that four-five get to bustin'
Now they get police rushin', rolled him up in a Creme Russian
Russian Creme, that's what you mean, bitch, I put on for my team
Me and Von just popped a bean, ready for 'bout anything
Traffic in that Trackhawk, run and get your ass caught
Don't know what your ass thought, this fight gon' be your last fault
Glock-22, it hold a fifty and a thirty
 (Fifty shots)
They just took Four-Oh, it made me thirsty, ain't no mercy
I don't want no Xan', pop his ass like a Perky
Nina on his ass, bad bitch, she be twerkin'

[Chorus: King Von]
I'm like fuck it, I ain't ducking, if it's war, it's bustin'
You claim this shit but ain't outside, boy, we on your cousin
Heard your OG just got married, boy, we on her husband
Hope you niggas brought your guns 'cause we brought a dozen
See, I be thirsty, I be lurking, I'm a savage with it
It's levels to this drilling shit and I'm not average with it
I put my eyes on a nigga, then I'm bound to get him
I catch your ass up in that ocean, then you drownin' with him

[Verse 2: King Von]
See Von been coolin', doin' music, gettin' bands and shit
Gettin' high and gettin' fly with my Amiri pants and shit
I think that nigga think I'm sweet 'cause I got fans and shit
Body count like 24, boy, who you playin' with?
I see him tweetin' on the 'Gram but I ain't sayin' shit
I'm outside his auntie crib, that's who he stayin' with
I hope TeeTee went to work 'cause I be slayin' shit
Smokin' bitches and niggas, can't tell the difference
Now here he go, I catch him comin' from the store
He lookin' down, he puttin' his keys up in his door
Now he look up, but he too late, I'm at his throat
Auntie got home and it was brains up on the floor

[Chorus: King Von]
I'm like fuck it, I ain't ducking, if it's war, it's bustin'
You claim this shit but ain't outside, boy, 
we on your cousin
Heard your OG just got married, boy, we on her husband
Hope you niggas brought your guns 'cause we brought a dozen
See, I be thirsty, I be lurking, I'm a savage with it
It's levels to this drilling shit and I'm not average with it
I put my eyes on a nigga, then I'm bound to get him
I catch your ass up in that ocean, then you drownin' with him
