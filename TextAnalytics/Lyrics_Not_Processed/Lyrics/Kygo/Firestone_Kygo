[Verse 1: Conrad Sewell]
I'm a flame, you're a fire
I'm the dark in need of light
When we touch, you inspire
Feel it changin' me tonight
Take me up, take me higher
There's a world not far from here
We can dance in desire
Or we can burn in love tonight

[Chorus: Conrad Sewell]
Our hearts are like firestones
And when they strike, we feel the love
Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
And when they strike, we light up the world

[Chorus: Conrad Sewell]
Our hearts are like firestones
And when they strike, we feel the love
Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
And when they strike, we light up the world
We light up the world

[Drop 1: Conrad Sewell]
We light up the world
Whoa, oh
World
Whoa, oh
Firestone

[Verse 2: Conrad Sewell]
I'm from X
You're from Y
Perfect strangers in the night
Here we are, come together
To the world we'll testify

[Chorus: Conrad Sewell]
Our hearts are like firestones
And when they strike, we feel the love
Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
And when they strike, we light up the world

[Chorus: Conrad Sewell]
Our hearts are like firestones
And when they strike, we feel the love
Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
And when they strike, we light up the world

[Drop 2: Conrad Sewell]
We light up the world
We light up the word
Whoa, oh
World
Whoa, oh
Firestone
