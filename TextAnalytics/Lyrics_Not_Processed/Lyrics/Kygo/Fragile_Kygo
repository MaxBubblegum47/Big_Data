[Verse 1: Labrinth]
Crazy to think that a man can't hurt
Love takes its toll every time it don't work, yeah
One door closes and another opens
But it's hard to let go when your heart's broken
I'll give you my trust, can you give me your word?

[Chorus: Labrinth]
Come take my heart of glass
And give me your love
I hope you'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile

[Verse 2: Labrinth]
After he left you in ten times ten
Could I put you back together again? Yeah
One door closes and another opens
But I won't let go cause I'm not like him
Baby just say the words, let the love begin

[Chorus: Labrinth]
Come take my heart of glass
And give me your love
I hope you'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile

[Refrain: Labrinth]
Oh oh hey
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love

[Bridge: Labrinth]
Yeah, you will take yours and mine
I got your heart of glass
You've got my love
I know we'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
Cause baby we're fragile, fragile, fragile
Cause baby we're fragile, fragile, fragile

[Refrain: Labrinth]
Oh oh hey
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love

[Outro: Labrinth]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
