[Verse 1: John Legend]
Beautiful, beautiful, no other name
I knew from the moment you came
I've seen in your eyes the dawn of a day
Where nothing will ever be the same

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend]
Feel my heart beating through my chest
I'll get used to just saying "yes"
Yes, I'll love you with all I am
Yes, tonight is where we began

[Chorus: John Legend]
Ooh, I wanna dance with you
Ooh, I'll promise to stand for you oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh I'll do anything for you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, tonight, my love all I want
I wanna sing for you
Yeah, I'll sing for you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Wrap you in love for the rest of my days
Pray you find joy through your pain
I can't protect you from every heartbreak
The world isn't easy that way

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend]
But I'll be there for you when you crawl
Dad will pick you up when you fall
Yes, I'll love you with all I am
Yes, tonight is where we began

[Chorus: John Legend]
Ooh, I wanna dance with you
Ooh, I'll promise to stand for you oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh I'll do anything for you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, tonight, my love all I want
I wanna sing for you
Yeah, I'll sing for you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you

[Bridge: John Legend]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro: John Legend]
Beautiful, beautiful, no other name
I knew from the moment you came
