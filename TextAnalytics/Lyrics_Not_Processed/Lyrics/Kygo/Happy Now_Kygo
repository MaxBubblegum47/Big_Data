[Verse 1]
We don't wanna believe it, that it’s all gone
It's just a matter of minutes before the sun goes down
We're afraid to admit it, but I know you know, know that
We should’ve known better, but kept on trying
And it's time that we see it, the fire's dying out
Can't believe that I say this, we're out of chances now
And I just want you to know that

[Chorus]
You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go, and I hope you’ll be happy now
You and me, it was good, but it wasn’t right
And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
Step by step, I’ll move on and get on with life
So I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now

[Post-Chorus]
I hope you'll be happy now
Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
I hope you’ll be happy now
Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
I hope you'll be happy now

[Verse 2]
I thought we would make it if I just held on
But it's really crazy how love could fade so fast
We said "forever," but now we're in the past
And I just want you to know that

[Chorus]
You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now
You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I hope you'll be happy now
I hope you'll be happy now
I hope you'll be happy now
I hope you'll be happy now
