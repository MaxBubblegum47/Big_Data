[Intro]
This a pain song but I'm letting everything go
I promise when, I speak specifically about anything
'Cause that's my way of showing I don't care no more
I'ma just go with my life
Until death call my name
Ayy, ayy, Youngboy, slime yeah (
Playboy on this bitch but he ain't playing though
)

[Chorus]
Too many problems, yeah
Thinking how I'm gon' solve it, yeah
So much pain in my body, yeah
They selling lies and I bought it, yeah
Don't tell me that you love me if you ain't gon' die for me, yeah
You can stay the fuck from 'round me if you ain't gon' ride for me, yeah
Told me you would never leave, how can you just lie to me? Yeah
Get from off your knees, you ain't got to cry to me, yeah
I been giving all my love, tell me, do you feel it?
Never learned how to trust sittin' in penitentiary
All for you, I'll take a slug, baby, who the realest?
Had to tell her I'm a genie, I can answer wishes, yeah

[Verse 1]
I got my static when you ride with me
We get pulled over no you ain't going to do no time for me
I put my hands up police drew down on me
So many charges make me wanna go away overseas
Reminiscing 'bout them days I was sittin' up in that cage
I was begging you to stay and you hung up in my face
Free Kodak, everything gettin' slayed
They keep begging me to change
Talked to Future the other day and he say I need to change lanes (Yeah)
Cause they gon' try to count you out til you make them count you in (Yeah)
Stimulate my brain (Yeah, yeah) had to tell 'em I ain't leaving out the same way I came in (Yeah, oh, fuck what I saying)
Whole lotta heroin, I sell that shit right in front of my momma
Swear I would never run just like a man I'ma face my problems
Even when my voice fucked up
I'ma spit in the booth I'ma go in like a goblin
Nigga got me fucked up
I'ma spin on his block, I admit that I had shot him
VVSs in my chain tell that ho Young Thug everything
Hearing voices in brain hoping everything change
I been rolling through the streets and been clutching on my heat
I put blood all on my feet and I put cameras in my trees (Baby)
Said I changed on you, but I feel that you changed on me (Changed on me)
I said my prayers and you gon' sow just what you reap (Yeah)
I been taking Adderall mixing it with lean (Mixin' it with lean)
Hope I don't wake up out my sleep

[Chorus]
Too many problems, yeah (Too many problems)
Thinking how I'm gon' solve it, yeah (Solve 'em, gon' solve 'em)
So much pain in my body, yeah (So much pain in my body)
They selling lies and I bought it, yeah (Selling lies and I bought it)
Don't tell me that you love me if you ain't gon' die for me, yeah (Oh)
You can stay the fuck from 'round me if you ain't gon' ride for me, yeah (Oh)
Told me you would never leave, how can you just lie to me? Yeah (Oh)
Get from off your knees, you ain't got to cry to me, yeah
I been giving all my love, tell me, do you feel it?
Never learned how to trust sittin' in penitentiary
All for you, I'll take a slug, baby, who the realest?
Had to tell her I'm a genie, I can answer wishes, yeah (Can answer wishes, slime)

[Verse 2]
Being in love never help me solve my problems (Solve my problems)
I wish that I could find a girl just like my mama
I don't wanna hurt nobody, but still ride around with that chopper (Yeah)
Zoe life to the end, tell them free the main sniper (Tell 'em free Kodak)

[Outro]
Yeah (I call that)
Slatt, slatt, slatt
That's all life
Sla-sla-slatt
Slatt, slatt, slatt
Yeah, that slatt
