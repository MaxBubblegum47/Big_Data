[Verse 1]
Oh, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial

[Verse 2]
Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on? How come cars don’t slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should, but I can’t let you go

[Chorus 1]
But when I’m cold, cold
When I’m cold, cold
There’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There’s a feeling within me, everglow

[Verse 3]
Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night, we’d be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And now, I’m gonna miss you, I know

[Chorus 2]
But when I’m cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you’re with me and the way you will show
And you’re with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling, this everglow

[Bridge]
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow

[Outro]
So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow
