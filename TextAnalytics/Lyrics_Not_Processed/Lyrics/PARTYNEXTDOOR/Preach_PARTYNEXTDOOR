[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm in Miami
I need to call up Miss Cassidy
My name is Party, not participation
Sorry for the miscommunication
I need a drink and some tequila with you
You know what I'm trying to do
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv
I've got some time here to blow
I've got the money to blow
I've got the money and blow
Don't have to guess how I know
Oh, it's a secret, trust me, I'll keep it
You old niggas as boring as bones
Keep put the PARTY tape on
You know what's going on, you know what's going on
She keep it wet like tsunami
She think she sunk the Titanic
I get her hot like Wasabi
She think it's wavy and gnarly
I think I'ma pop one for you
Drink one for you

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Drake]
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach
Preach, preach (Yeah), preach, preach

[Verse 2: Drake]
Still in Miami, most of these girls are too messy
I gotta do some reflecting
I gotta find me one out here that's good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr!
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type, yeah
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight, yeah
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in they feelings these days
All in they feelings these days
But hearing a scripture with that many 6s, you should be afraid

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Drake]
Young nigga preach (Preach)
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Ciara]
I'm preaching, oooh
Preaching, preaching, babe
Preaching, whooo
I'ma finally, finally, yeah
Boy you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
And I can't deny it
I want you, I'm on you
