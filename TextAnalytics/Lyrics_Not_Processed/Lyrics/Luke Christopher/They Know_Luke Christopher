[Hook]
They can send me them dirty pictures
Know they gon' grab on me in the club
Know they gonna wink whenever I'm witcha'
I know they gon' try, but there's nothing they could do
There's nothing they could do
'Cause there's nothing they could do
'Cause they know I fuck witchu', cause they know I fuck witchu'

[Verse 1: Luke Christopher]
I got twenty-one years in this beautiful world
Why would I be witchu' if I was looking for girls?
I'm past that, unless she got ass, wait... I'm tripping
You say you caught me slipping, say "I'm honest when I'm sipping"
But it's real though, for real though
All of these questions, I answer
God damn, um, guess I'd respect 'em
But baby you know this, told you before this
Girl if I'm mad and they looking, it's hopeless
I notice even when the cash goes down
You always pick me back up off the ground
Baby you my ride or die, I'mma wife ya
They just some sparks tryna light them on fire
Do I look to you like I delve in desire?
I'm just too focused on taking us higher
You need a G though, I told you I'd be that
But if I see Rihanna, you promise we'll three that?

[Verse 2: Luke Christopher]
Yeah, they show me love, they grope me up, it's true
But that ain't love, then girl I'm done for you
You saw the picture, girl, that wasn't shit
She just wanted an autograph, I just wrote it on tits
It was never that wrong, it was never that bad
She probably only did it to be balling on the gram
And niggas always say that girls is calling for your man
Nigga you should do it too, nigga you should do that
If I say a word, then it's just to get the crew ass
Some groupies by the exit, ask around, "Where Luke at?"
Know they gon' say it, they could never prove that
You tryna get a nigga, I'm just tryna see where you at

[Bridge: Luke Christopher]
Yeah, she got me feeling like
I don't wanna be a player no more
Tonight I'm only fucking witchu' girl
Yeah, I don't wanna be a player no more
Tonight I'm only fucking witchu' my baby
Yeah, I don't wanna be a player no more
Tonight I'm only fucking witchu' girl
Yeah, I don't wanna be a player no more
Tonight I'm only fucking witchu', I'm only fucking witchu'
