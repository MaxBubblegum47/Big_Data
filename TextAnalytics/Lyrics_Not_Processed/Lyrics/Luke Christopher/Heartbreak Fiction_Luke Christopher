[Hook: Luke Christopher]
I got this heartbreak fiction
I keep saying that it can't be over this fast
All the lines we've written
They're so poetic, I just can't put them in my past
Heartbreak fiction
You keep saying that there's just no way we could last
Baby am I tripping?
I keep thinking that it just all happened too fast
I'm in love

[Verse 1: Luke Christopher]
You were storming out of the kitchen
I chased you like an addiction
I got your arm, I'm yelling "Why you never listen?"
Your parents called and said we need an intervention
How could I be so stupid?
Thought it real when it was fiction, it's clear
I just never pictured us here
I should've framed it when the picture was clear
Now I'm driving in the car thinking "How I’m gonna fix this again?"
I know they talking to you, you should be dismissing your friends
They never liked me, ain't ever liked me
And I can't picture someone like you girl, I need my wifey
I'm getting lost in different women, they just don't excite me
I'd rather make love once than fuck twenty times, see?
And I ain't lying, I'm a lost cause for somebody that completes me
Or maybe just somebody that needs me
And right now girl it's really hard to be me
I'm wondering if you'd be down to see me

I got this heartbreak fiction
I keep saying that it can’t be over this fast
All the lines we’ve written
They’re so poetic, I just can’t put them in my past
Got me tripping all night long
I might as well, long I might as well call
Now we’re talking all night long
I miss you girl, you say you miss me more
I’m numb

[Verse 2: Luke Christopher]
Girl what the hell is wrong with us?
It’s like the past, the fucking past is haunting us
It’s like the axe, the fucking axe is wanting us
Say you learned a lot from the moments had its all because
You done had the feeling and you thought it was the truth now
It just started killing you, but you ain’t had no proof now
I ain’t gonna sit here acting like I didn’t do that
But anything and anyone never had shit on you now
And it’s got me feeling blue now
Yellow for these letters that I write you in the booth now
I guess there’s nothing left to lose now
I just hope I see you soon now
