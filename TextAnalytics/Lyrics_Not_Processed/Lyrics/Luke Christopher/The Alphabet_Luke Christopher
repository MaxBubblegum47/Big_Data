[Verse 1]
Yeah, it goes A's for Ambition
B what I wanna be
C past the situation that's in front of me
Doubters and Enemies F we say Fuck 'em
The irony is they inspire me to love 'em
G is past go and ignite the cash flow
And H is put your Heart in whatever's your last hope
I is I Inspire but you light the fire so we be the street's number one supplier
And J is for them Jordan's for my niggas when I make it
Gimme two of those strange no name Kicks
Earth, wind, and fire type elemental peace
That resembles me and here accounts for L-M-N-O-P
Q (Cue) the track up like R you impressed?
Get your bread kid but never let it go to your head
That's S for Success to be the best and
T is Teach back what you learnt that's next
Cause you U got the power V for voluntary action
W is Write out your life with a passion
X is Expect to fail, Y cease to dream
Even when you ain't catching them Z's and that's the alphabet

[Hook]
I've been trying for so long
Been surviving for so long
I know, I know that good things will come
I've been trying for so long
Been surviving for so long
I know, I know that good things will come, they will come

[Verse 2]
Yo, think they starting to follow me
So A is to Attempt to B the change you wanna C
And D is to be Different but tell us what you mean
Like are you one of them good guys or you one of them fiends
Either way you gotta E uh huh, Elevate your mind right
Cause F is for the Fine Life and that's how you define life
But I say G is Get back to your home
And H is Help the people that done helped you along
Aw yeah fuck if we go back to F cause that's for Freedom
G is keep your Good thoughts cause buddy you gon' need 'em
And H is if your Hood starves buddy you gonna feed 'em
Cause it's bad enough when niggas get the check and get to leave in
J is for them jump-offs we wanted as kids
Looking through the glass seeing the life we wanna live in
M is mo' money, mo' problems in N-O is NO P's and that's pessimistic profits
Q, Quit thinking and R you still with me?
And S is Stress-less and T is To infinity
U, is that it's all about You and that's why
A nigga fucked around and left out "I"
V-W is Very Wise, and X is this Example
Why lie you got zip if you ain't got fam and that's the alphabet

[Hook]
I've been trying for so long
Been surviving for so long
I know, I know that good things will come
I've been trying for so long
Been surviving for so long
I know, I know that good things will come, they will come
