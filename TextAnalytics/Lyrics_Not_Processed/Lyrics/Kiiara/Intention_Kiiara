[Intro]
Casper and B

[Verse 1]
Blood on the street, like I blacked out
Ghosts in the air, like I'm wack now
No one really cares when you talk loud
While I sit in silence, blinking while the light's out
Now I'm here thinking that I messed up
Looking at you, you don't have a chance fo
r me, no, no
Oh ya, ya

[Pre-Chorus]
(Now I'm here thinking that I messed up
And I don't understand)
And I don't know what you're saying
But you're talking so loud
(Now I'm here thinking that I messed up
And I don't understand)
Then I try to explain it
But you're never around

[Chorus]
Never my intention, no
Never my intention, no
Never my intention, no
No, no ya never my intention
Never my intention, no
Never my intention, no
No, no ya never my intention
Never my intention

[Verse 2]
Dust on the ground when I lie down
Rum on my lips, cut the lights off
Staring at the ceiling 'til I pass out
While I wait in silence, wishing you were downtown
Now I'm here thinking that I messed up
As you try to fix it all, I hesitate to trust ya
Oh ya, ya

[Pre-Chorus]
(Now I'm here thinking that I messed up
And I don't understand)
And I don't know what you're saying
But you're talking so loud
(Now I'm here thinking that I messed up
And I don't understand)
Then I try to explain it
But you're never around

[Chorus]
Never my intention, no
Never my intention, no
Never my intention, no
No, no ya never my intention
Never my intention, no
Never my intention, no
No, no ya never my intention
Never my intention
Never my intention

[Chorus]
Never my intention, no
Never my intention, no
Never my intention, no
No, no ya never my intention
Never my intention, no
Never my intention, no
No, no ya never my intention
Never my intention
Never my intention
