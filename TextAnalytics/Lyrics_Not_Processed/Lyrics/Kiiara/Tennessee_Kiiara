[Verse 1]
I’m a ghost when I walk in
Holy spirit when I walk out
You want that fame, you can have that fame
Disappearing when the light’s out
Chasing money got me feelin’ funny (Ooh, why)
We just want that real shit (Ooh, why)
All those pictures on the internet (Ooh, why)
Burn ‘em up like a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh, why) We just want that real shit
(Ooh, why) We just want that real
(Ooh, why) Now you just a memory
(Ooh, why) Sippin’ on that Tennessee

[Chorus]
Sippin’ on that Tennessee
Sippin’ on that Tennessee
Sippin’ on that Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Want that feeling when you can’t breathe
I like the color red, so I let it bleed
Something pretty ‘bout the pain, so real
It’s like a game to me, it’s like a game to me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh, why) We just want that real shit
(Ooh, why) We just want that real
(Ooh, why) Now you just a memory
(Ooh, why) Sippin’ on that Tennessee

[Chorus]
Sippin’ on that Tennessee
Sippin’ on that Tennessee
(Do it!)
Sippin’ on that Tennessee
Sippin’ on that Tennessee

[Bridge]
Do you remember when they bowed to us like kings, my friend?
We were the champions, we were the champions
Hey now even when castles half-blown to the wind
I know they talk about us now and then
Saying we were the champions
We were the champions
Sippin’ on that Tennessee
(Do it!)

[Chorus]
Sippin’ on that Tennessee
Sippin’ on that Tennessee
