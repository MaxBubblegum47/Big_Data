[Chorus]
And I got way too many feels
Way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper
Yeah, I feel I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah, I see you
I don't know, I think I'm rolling
And yeah, it's way too many feels
Way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
I get deeper, I get deeper
Yeah, I think I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah, I see him
I don't know, I just keep going

[Verse 1]
And I got way too many feelings
Way too much emotion
All the Xans inside my body
I say fuck it, keep on drowning
Yeah, you can bring a juice, I'll match you
Yeah, you mix it, pour the potion
I don't know who you are
But I'd dive into your ocean
And yeah, you say you smoking grams
I'm smoking into the GRAMMYs
Say you got them bars, but all I see is candy
Still you came through so low-key
Think you understand, I don't know me
Still, I get along with your best friends
Even better with your family

[Chorus]
And I got way too many feels
Way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper
Yeah, I think I'm rolling
If I see him, yeah, I see him
I don't know I just keep going

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's way too many feels
Way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
I got all I need, you don't know what I mean
Yeah, we pour up 'til we go up (Go-go up), ooh
And I got way too many feels
Not enough to forfeit
So many fuckin' bands
So you know we finna blow it
We be faded when I'm sober
Sober when I'm faded
Over-scrutinized by all your counterparts
There's no debating

[Bridge]
You say it's 'cause they jaded
Yeah, they jealous that I made it
Do you remember that first time
I missed you in my basement?
Back when we really didn't know it
We were searching for some
Now they pay full advance
And there ain't no fucking discussion
At the stage, yeah, they jumping because it's like that
You see all these chicks and now your girl ain't even write back
You drink all my Rose, and you know what to do
Someone dropped up a dose, so we finna get screwed

[Outro]
You know I got like way too many feels
Way too much emotion
Don't know how to make you feel
But I'm sorry, bitch, I'm flowin'
You know I just drop top in that coupe, zoom
Don't know where you been at, true
Now I'm searchin' for who? You
Yeah, I'm comin' right back
And I got way too many feels
Way too many feels
