[Intro: Kiiara]
Some days I can't get out of my head
That's just the dark side of me
Some nights, it's hard for me to fall asleep
That's just the dark side of me
If you ever ever call my name, name
You will find out that we're both the same
When the lights go out, I need to know
Are you afraid of the dark?
I'm not afraid of the dark

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I am not afraid, I am not afraid ('fraid)
Sick of the oppression and all the hate (hate)
Money and the power, social rank (rank)
Lot of pride now, not enough loyalty (ooh, yeah)
Had to change my life for the better things (yeah)
Had to boss up and overcome adversity (yeah)
I put my brother in position (position)
I know some didn't see the vision (see the vision)
I'm just livin' by tradition
And I'd die for my respect (respect)
And I'd die for my Patek ('tek, 'tek)
You might die for disrespect
And I'm not afraid ('fraid)
Last time I checked, I ain't ever been scared of nobody
I wanna know, when it get real (real)
Who gon' be out on the front line in the field? (Field)
Who gon' be there for the good times and the bad?
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back

[Chorus: Kiiara & 
Ty Dolla $ign
]
Some days I close my eyes and fade away
And I fade away
That's just the dark side of me
Some nights all the colors turn to grey
Some nights all the colors turn to grey
Just like the dark side of me
I'm not afraid of the dark

[Verse 2: Future]
I went way beyond anyone's expectations
Got the 'Rarri turned on just in case we're racin'
I was already in the third gear by the time niggas hatin'
Who gon' be in the field for me when I make it?
Started off in the trenches, how I'ma ever go pop?
Already on the moon, already with the goons
Already on shrooms (already on shrooms)
I'm already on Easter, I'm already as a teacher
Watch for the throne, I'm like Yeezus
They tryna clone me, thinkin' I don't see 'em
They take subliminal shots thinkin' we don't hear 'em
I'm one-of-a-kind, that's how I'm gon' kill 'em

[Bridge: Kiiara & 
Ty Dolla $ign
]
I've got a human heart
I've got a human heart
Are you afraid of the dark?
The dark, 
the dark
The dark, 
the dark
, the dark
I've got a human heart
I've got a human heart
Are you afraid of the dark? 
The dark
The dark, 
the dark
The dark, 
the dark
, the dark

[Chorus: Kiiara & 
Ty Dolla $ign
]
Some days I close my eyes and fade away
And I fade away
That's just the dark side of me
Some nights all the colors turn to grey
Some nights all the colors turn to grey
Just like the dark side of me
I'm not afraid of the dark
The dark, the dark, the dark
I'm not afraid of the dark
The dark, the dark, the dark
I'm not afraid of the dark
