[Chorus]
You say we had it all
That shit would drive me crazy
'Cause outside, outside
There's no feelings baby
You say it's hard to tell
What I've been thinking lately
But behind closed doors
I'm a fool for your love
You say we had it all
That shit would drive me crazy
'Cause outside, outside
There's no feelings baby
You say it's hard to tell
What I've been thinking lately
But behind closed doors
I'm a fool for your love

[Verse 1]
Her last semester's over
Parents  in Minnesota
Chicago's waiting for
Job offers on the table
And she tells all her friends
That's why they think we're stable
But I got plans of my own
But better with no label
And I'm loving the way
That you move to my vibe
And you dance to my songs
But I feel like it's 'bout to be me
Who goes off and does something so wrong
Know I take it for granted
Knew I'd be breaking your heart
'Till I vanished
Soon as you walk out that door I panic
See I'm never gonna understand it

[Chorus]
You say we had it all
That shit would drive me crazy
'Cause outside, outside
There's no feelings baby
You say it's hard to tell
What I've been thinking lately
But behind closed doors
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love

[Verse 2]
My heart she stealing
Manipulating my feelings darling
Something's gotta be different
I can't stand this feeling, hardly
See the point to be living
If you just got me wrapped in circles
But I stand, why you sitting
Speak my mind cause its honest
It's all about you, hey
Saying you want my name
Got no soul to pay with
It's a crazy game
Got no child
But you still gotta deal with childish shit all day
Still I want you
Through these nights we lay awake

[Chorus]
You say we had it all
That shit would drive me crazy
'Cause outside, outside
There's no feelings baby
You say it's hard to tell
What I've been thinking lately
But behind closed doors
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love

[Bridge]
And when we get together
She says let's make this open
Relationships are better
When you leave out the hoping
Wish I could simply just tell her
Whatever we had is broken
But it always ends
But it always ends the same

[Chorus]
You say we had it all
That shit would drive me crazy
'Cause outside, outside
There's no feelings baby
You say it's hard to tell
What I've been thinking lately
But behind closed doors
I'm a fool for your love

[Bridge]
She says let's make this open
Relationships are better
When you leave out the hoping
Wish I could simply just tell her
Whatever we had is broken
But it always ends
But it always ends the same
