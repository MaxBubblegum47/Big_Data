[Intro]
You hate when my head
Hangs low after all
These things you said
Trust it's not your fault
Can’t expect you to understand
Take it back to when it began
Had I just followed all my plans
I wouldn’t have ended up so lost
Now we’re both so off
And I’m still the one to blame
Can’t say we’ll stay the same
Can’t say we’ll stay the same

[Chorus]
Baby, baby stay here
I need some time to clear my mind
We both know it’s a problem
When you call me all the time
And I’ll say
I may just need a little bit longer, yeah
I may just need you to be stronger
If I’m not there with you

[Post-Chorus]
If I’m not there with you
I can’t hold this fight in anymore
If I’m not there with you
I can’t hold this fight in anymore

[Chorus]
Baby, baby stay here
I need some time to clear my mind
We both know it’s a problem
When you call me all the time
And I’ll say
I may just need a little bit longer, yeah
I may just need you to be stronger, Oh
If I’m not there with you

[Outro]
If I’m not there with you
If I’m not there with you
If I’m not there with you
If I’m not there with you
If I’m not there with you
If I’m not there with you
If I’m not there with you
