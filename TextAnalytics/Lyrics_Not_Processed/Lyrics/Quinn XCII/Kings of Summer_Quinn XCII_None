[Intro]
Oh yes
Oh yes, yeah
Oh yes, yeah
Yeah
Like mom's not home
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three

[Chorus]
Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home (not home)
Tell me why the best things feel so wrong (so wrong)
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long (so long)
Run with the feeling
Of being alive while we're still young
Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home (not home)
Just a couple kids livin' on our own (on our own)
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long (so long)
Run with the feeling
Of being alive while we're still young
Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home (not home)
Tell me why the best things feel so wrong (so wrong)
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long (so long)
Run with the feeling
Of being alive while we're still young
Jumpin' off the porch like mom's not home (not home)
Just a couple kids living on our own (on our own)
Summer nights
Love 'em how they take so long (so long)
Run with the feeling
Of being alive while we're still young
(Still young, still young, still young, still young)
