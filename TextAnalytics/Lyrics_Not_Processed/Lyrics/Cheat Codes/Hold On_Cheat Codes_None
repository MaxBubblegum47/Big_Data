[Verse 1]
I'm ashamed by the lies and the worthless games
But the wine and the night make me feel okay
No other you, no other me, not other us, babe
One of a kind and I won't let it slip away

[Chorus]
I can see you in my head
I can see you in my bed
I can see you doing all those things we used to do instead
Or the fights at 2 am
When you knew I was your man
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout
I really gotta hold on

[Verse 2]
Come back home, we can fight
I can take the blame
And I bet make-up sex makes us feel okay
Give it back, give me love
Don't you run away
Got a list, couple things that'll make you stay

[Chorus]
I can see you in my head
I can see you in my bed
I can see you doing all those things we used to do instead
Or the fights at 2 am
When you knew I was your man
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout
I really gotta hold on, hold on
I really gotta hold on, hold on
I really gotta hold on, hold on
I really gotta hold on, hold on you
Hold on you
I can see you in my head
I can see you in my bed
I can see you doing all those things we used to do instead
Or the fights at 2 am
When you knew I was your man
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout
I really gotta hold on, hold on
I really gotta hold on, hold on
I really gotta hold on, hold on
I really gotta hold on, hold on you
Hold on you
