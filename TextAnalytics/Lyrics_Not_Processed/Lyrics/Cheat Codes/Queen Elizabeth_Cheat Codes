[Verse 1]
Elizabeth, Elizabeth, she's the girl next door
But she's a little bit
Yeah, to me, she's a little bit more
When I'm with her, then I feel like a king
Yes, I feel like a king
To be in her grace, I would do anything
I would do anything

[Pre-Chorus]
I would go down on my knees, down on my knees
Down on my knees, down on my knees, down on my knees
Down on my knees, down on my knees, down on my knees
Down on my knees, down on my knees, down on my

[Chorus]
Oh, Queen Elizabeth
You're the one that I wanna be with
My Queen Elizabeth
Give it up, give it up, give it up just a little bit
Oh, Queen Elizabeth
You're the one that I wanna be with
You're the one that I wanna be with now

[Verse 2]
Elizabeth, I am here at your beck & call
And in a little bit, I'll have you climbing the castle walls
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Can't keep me away, keep me away
I'll be you knight any time of the day, any time of the day

[Pre-Chorus]
I will go down on my knees, down on my knees
Down on my knees, down on my knees, down on my knees
Down on my knees, down on my knees, down on my knees
Down on my knees, down on my knees, down on my

[Chorus]
Oh, Queen Elizabeth
You're the one that I wanna be with
My Queen Elizabeth
Give it up, give it up, give it up just a little bit
Oh, Queen Elizabeth
You're the one that I wanna be with now
You're the one that I wanna be with now

[Bridge]
I'll give you the world with diamonds and pearls
No other girl I want to hold on to
I confess I'd like to undress and make a princess
A prince if you want to
Lay with me, we can rule the world together
You're royalty in my eyes

[Chorus]
Oh, Queen Elizabeth
You're the one that I wanna be with
My Queen Elizabeth
Give it up, give it up, give it up just a little bit
Oh, Queen Elizabeth
You're the one that I wanna be with now
You're the one that I wanna be with now

[Outro]
You're the one that I wanna be with now
You're the one that I wanna be with now
