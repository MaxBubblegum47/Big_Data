[Intro: Killer Mike & El-P]
Run, run, run, run, run
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

[Verse 1: El-P & Killer Mike]
Oh dear, what the fuck have we here?
These motherfuckers all thorn, no rose
Egads, what a bad dream, better not sleep
Take a No-Doz, do some blow
Oh shit, what the hell have we done?
It's alive and it's hungry as fuck
Better hide all the snacks and the dough
But it is out of my control, you are shit out of luck
I don't wanna be unfair, but the pair we got
Beat that weak shit you got (True, God)
Blew up the spot with that new bop
(Crew drops) Do up ya squad without nuance
I don't wanna sound unkind but the sounds I make
Are the sounds of the hounds that are howling
Under your bed, I'm here growling
Same time, under the blanket, you're cowering

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Cowering like cowards cowering in
Concrete showers in Rikers Island
Victims, we the wolves that's wilding
We often smilin' at sights of violence
Acting brave and courageous
Ain't advantageous for health and safety
So when we say, "Run the jewels"
Just run 'em, baby, please don't delay me
And that goes for a guy or lady
The fam, goddamn, we fuckin' crazy
I'll pull this pistol
Put it on your poodle or your fuckin' baby
She clutched the pearls, said, "What in the world?"
And, "I won't give up shit!"
I put the pistol on that poodle and I shot that bitch

[Chorus: Killer Mike]
Run the jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels
Run the jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels

[Verse 3: El-P & Killer Mike]
Ay, ay, and the crowd chants, "Get that paper!" (Run)
And the mob says, "Kill that witch!" (Run)
This city get mad to the max
Better wave 'bye-de-bye' to the high scrapes, kids
Get a tinfoil hat for the raining (Run)
Hot water from the roof to the basement
I'ma smoke 'til the planet erases
Build a white flag out of Zig Zags, wave it

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Often, I'm smoking, coughing
Sip lean on a bean like Boston
My young bitch here fine like Pam Grier
When she made that movie 'Coffy'
But when my wife's in town
Ayy, Jackie Brown, just stay up off me
'Cause if they don't, then somebody getting shot
And they gon' buy a coffin

[Verse 5: El-P]
With the pull of a pin, a grenade
Get a crowd to they feet and a soul to its options
I'm a fool for the win, I been made
To be loud while these other cats drowning in softness
In a urn or the dirt get tossed in
With a grin or a smirk, get accosted
I'm a sin on the verse like a kid in a hearse
Or a nun in a cumshotâ€”stop it

[Verse 6: Killer Mike]
Big beast in a cage with a heart full of rage
It seems I can't behave
You could try till you die, oh well
You failed, it seems the world can't be saved
These streets is full with the wolves
That starve for the week so they after the weak
In a land full of lambs, I am
And I'll be damned if I don't show my teeth

[Chorus: Killer Mike]
Run the jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels
Run the jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels, jewels

[Outro: El-P]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
The goblins were awakened
