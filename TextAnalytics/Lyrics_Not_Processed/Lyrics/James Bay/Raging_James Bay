[Verse 1]
Standing in the cold in the frozen wind
I'm leaving you behind but it's not the end
No, no, no
Walking on a plane as I hold my breath
It's gonna be weeks 'til I breathe again
No, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you hate it
And I hate it just as much as you
But if you can brave it, I can brave it
Brave it all for you

[Chorus 1]
Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Don't you feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging
Lost among a million changing faces
Every day our hearts keep trading places
We've got a wild love raging, raging

[Post-Chorus]
Raging, raging
Raging, raging
Raging, raging

[Verse 2]
Checking into hotel loneliness
It's not what I've been used to, I confess
To wake up three times a night
Talking to a stranger's nothing new
She knows how to smile, but not like you
So I wait for you all night

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you hate it
And I hate it just as much as you
But if you can brave it, I can brave it
Brave it all for you

[Chorus 1]
Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Don't you feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging
Lost among a million changing faces
Every day our hearts keep trading places
We've got a wild love raging, raging

[Post-Chorus]
Raging, raging

[Chorus 2]
Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Don't you feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging
Rolling on the wind with you forever
Holding onto us for worse or better
We've got a wild love raging, raging

[Post-Chorus]
Raging, raging
Raging, raging

[Outro]
Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Never feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging
