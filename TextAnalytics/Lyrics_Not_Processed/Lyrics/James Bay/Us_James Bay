[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm beaten
Sometimes I'm broke
‘Cause sometimes this city is nothing but smoke
Is there a secret?
Is there a code?
Can we make it better?
'Cause I'm losing hope

[Chorus]
Tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us

[Verse 2]
After the wreckage
After the dust
I still hear the howling, I still feel the rush
Over the riots, above all the noise
Through all the worry, 
I still hear your voice

[Chorus]
So, tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how ‘cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes down
That even in the dark we will find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us

[Bridge]
We used to be kids living just for kicks
In cinema seats, learning how to kiss
Running through streets that were painted gold
We never believed we'd grow up like this

[Chorus]
So tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes down
That even in the dark we can find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
I believe in something
And I believe in us
