[Verse 1]
Don't fall into my arms
Don't ask me to repeat it
Don't suffocate my heart
I don't know what I'm feeling

[Chorus]
"Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?"
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you
Don't ask me
"Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?"
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

[Verse 2]
Don't fall into my arms
I'll only disappoint you, I'll let you down
Don't go soundin' the alarms
When all I do is warn you

[Chorus]
So don't ask me
"Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?"
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you
Don't ask me
"Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?"
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

[Bridge]
Let me wake up heavy head
Lying in my bed with you naked
Go put that song on, that you love
On repeat, until we can't take it
I wanna drink pink lemonade
Watching movie trailers 'til it's late
And let's remember all the ones
That we think are gonna make our hearts break

[Chorus]
Don't ask me
"Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?"
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you
Don't ask me
"Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?"
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you

[Outro]
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
I'm just thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
Thinking of you
I'm just thinking of you
Thinking of you
I'm protecting you, I'm protecting you
I'm protecting you from what I don't wanna have to say
I'm protecting you, I'm protecting you
I'm protecting us 'cause I don't wanna walk away
You
Thinking of you
I'm just thinking of you
Thinking of you
