[Verse 1]
Tried to keep you close to me
But life got in between
Tried to square not being there
But think that I should have been

[Chorus]
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back

[Verse 2]
Once upon a different life
We rode our bikes into the sky
But now we crawl against the tide
Those distant days are flashing by

[Chorus]
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back

[Chorus]
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Hold back the river, hold back

[Interlude]
Hold oho, oho, oho
Oho, oho, oho, oho

[Bridge]
Lonely water, lonely water won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Lonely water, lonely water won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other

[Chorus]
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back

[Chorus]
Hold back the river, let me look in your eyes
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river, hold back

[Bridge]
Lonely water, lonely water won't you let us wander
Let us hold each other
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Let us hold each other
