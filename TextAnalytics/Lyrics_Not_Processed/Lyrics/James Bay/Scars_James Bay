[Spoken Intro]

[Verse One]
You're setting off
It's time to go, the engine's running
My mind is lost
We always knew this day was coming
And now it's more frightening than it's ever gonna be
We grow apart
I watch you on the red horizon
Your lion's heart
Will protect you under stormy skies
And I will always be listening for your laughter and your tears

[Pre-Chorus]
And as soon as I can hold you once again
I won't let go of you, I swear

[Chorus]
We live through scars this time
But I've made up my mind
We can't leave us behind anymore

[Verse Two]
Your hands are cold
Your lips are turning blue, you're shaking
This fragile heart
So heavy in my chest, it's breaking
And in the dark, you try to make a pay phone call to me
But you're miles away
You're breaking up, you're on your own
It's hard to take
I need an hour just to say hello
And I can't make the truth of this work out for you or me

[Pre-Chorus]
And for all the pennies in your pocket
We barely get a second just to speak

[Chorus]
We live through scars this time
But I've made up my mind
We can't leave us behind anymore
We'll have to hurt for now
But next time there's no doubt
Cause I can't go without you anymore
Oh, no
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, no, oh
We get hurt

[Chorus]
We live through scars this time
But I've made up my mind
No, we can't leave us behind anymore
We'll have to hurt for now
But next time, there's no doubt
Cause I can't go without you anymore
No, I can't go without you anymore
