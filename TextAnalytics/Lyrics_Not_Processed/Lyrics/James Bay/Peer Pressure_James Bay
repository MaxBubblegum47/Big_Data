[Verse 1: James Bay]
Seven texts, 2AM
Halfway dressed, they're all saying, "Call me up"
You can’t sleep, you're testing me
Bad but sweet and I'm just tryna keep it together, oh
And now you’re sayin'...

[Chorus: James Bay]
Put your hands on my body just like you think you know me
Want your heart beating on me, don't leave me hot and lonely
I don't usually give in to peer pressure
But I'll give in to yours

[Verse 2: James Bay, 
James Bay & Julia Michaels
]
When we met, innocent
Now I'm dead every time you're touchin' me
You’re dancing around on my mind every second
I’m under control till you're in front of me
Maybe I’m scared, I don't care, I'm addicted
I'm in it
And you say...

[Chorus: James Bay & Julia Michaels, 
James Bay
]
Put your hands on my body just like you think you know me
Want your heart beating on me, don’t leave me hot and lonely
I don't usually give in to peer pressure
But I'll give in to yours
So I give you my everything and you keep on teasing
With that look in your eyes 'cause you know I believe it
I don't usually give in to peer pressure
But I'll give in to yours

[Post-Chorus: James Bay & Julia Michaels]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, I'll give in to yours
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge: James Bay]
When we met, innocent
Now I'm dead and you're sayin'...

[Chorus: James Bay & Julia Michaels]
Put your hands on my body just like you think you know me
Want your heart beating on me, don't leave me hot and lonely
I don't usually give in to peer pressure
But I'll give in to yours
So I give you my everything and you keep on teasing
With that look in your eyes 'cause you know I believe it
I don't usually give in to peer pressure
Oh, but I'll give in to yours

[Post-Chorus: James Bay & Julia Michaels]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Mmm, yeah, I'll give in to yours
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh

[Outro: James Bay]
You're dancing around on my mind every second
I'm under control till you're in front of me
Maybe I'm scared, I don't care, I'm addicted
I'm in it
