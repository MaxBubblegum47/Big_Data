[Verse 1]
I know it hurts that we don't touch anymore
It's even worse because we built this from the floor
It's just as hard for me to know I might see you 'round
It's just as hard for me to worry 'bout reachin' out

[Pre-Chorus]
The more I think about you, the more I keep the ghost alive
Yeah, the more I think about you, the more I keep the ghost alive

[Chorus]
I want you bad, but it's done
I'm bleeding out, 'cause we can't go on
I want you bad, till I shake
I want what we had, but what's broken don't unbreak

[Verse 2]
Just when I'm ready to get over you, you call me up
And then I crumble when you say you're getting over us

[Pre-Chorus]
But the more I think about you, the more I keep the ghost alive
Yeah, the more that I'm without you, the less I know if I was right

[Chorus]
I want you bad, but it's done
I'm bleeding out, 'cause we can't go on
I want you bad, till I shake
I want what we had, but what's broken don't unbreak

[Bridge]
And I won't tell you what I want to
What I want to
I'm falling through, I can't hide it
But I learn to

[Chorus]
I want you bad, but it's done
I'm bleeding out, 'cause we can't go on
I want you bad, till I shake
I want what we had, but what's broken don't unbreak

[Outro]
I want you bad, but it's done
I want you bad, but we can't go on
