[Intro: Billy Ray Cyrus & Young Thug]
Yeehaw
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

[Refrain: Billy Ray Cyrus & Young Thug]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio, woo)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X & Young Thug]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match (Woo)
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Maserati rowdy, got a V12 for my bride (Skrrt)
Foggy rocky road, got a three-wheeler inside (Ayy)
All I wanna do is take a pill, catch a chill vibe
Real prince, I'm really the real don
I'ma take a horse to the South Berry Road (Ayy)
I don't remember her name, but I painted on her nose (Ayy)
Country money, I don't gotta do no chores
I'm a menace, I got women tryna sneak me through their doors (Skrrt)

[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me, you can't tell me

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car

[Bridge: Mason Ramsey with Lil Nas X]
Hold up, let me tell y'all somethin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 4: Mason Ramsey]
Hop up in my RZR, got a thousand acres
Ride up on the cows with it, pray that it don't faze her
Aye-o, aye-o, yippee-o ki-yay
If you ain't got no giddy up then giddy out my way

[Refrain: Billy Ray Cyrus, Mason Ramsey & Lil Nas X]
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Outro: Young Thug]
Yeehaw
