[Verse 1]
I was just hot roddin', ridin' around
'Til that new girl showed up in town
Did a whole lot more than just slow me down
She stopped me in my tracks
Well, I pushed and pulled and I grabbed a wench
But since that day, I ain't moved an inch
Ba-da-baby, I'm convinced there ain't no turnin' back

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck in a puddle of love
Everything that girl does sinks me deeper in the mud
I might stay right here forever, ain't a tractor or a truck
That's gonna pull me out, 'cause, girl, I'm stuck
In a puddle of love, stuck in a puddle of love
Yeah, I'm stuck in a puddle of love, stuck in a puddle of love

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I might as well get comfy, make myself at home
Since we're out in the country, I'll sing you some country songs
And girl, I'll start with "Cheating Heart" and then "The Lovesick Blues"
'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere, at least no time soon

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck in a puddle of love
Everything that girl does sinks me deeper in the mud
I might stay right here forever, ain't a tractor or a truck
That's gonna pull me out, 'cause, girl, I'm stuck
In a puddle of love, stuck in a puddle of love
Yeah, I'm stuck in a puddle of love, stuck in a puddle of love

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck in a puddle of love
Everything that girl does sinks me deeper in the mud
I might stay right here forever, ain't a tractor or a truck
That's gonna pull me out, 'cause, girl, I'm stuck
In a puddle of love, stuck in a puddle of love
Yeah, I'm stuck in a puddle of love, stuck in a puddle of love
Yeah, I'm stuck in a puddle of love, stuck in a puddle of love
Yeah, I'm stuck in a puddle of love, stuck in a puddle of love
