[Verse 1]
The way I see it
Money ain't evil
God ain't just in a box with the steeple
Nothing wrong with city but I love country people
Friday nights, I'd rather hear Hank than the Beatles

[Refrain]
The way I see it
You sow your wild oats
Howl up at the moon
Tell a few jokes
Till you get lucky
Find yourself a keeper
Take her home to mama
Put a ring on her finger

[Chorus]
Don't get any better from where I'm sitting
Sunset swingin' with a front porch view
Right about now, ain't a thing I'm missin'
Six string in my hands, right next to you
If we're talking 'bout heaven, this night already been
Baby, you and me forever, that's the way I see it
You and me forever, that's the way I see it

[Verse 2]
The way I see it town's too crowded
Truck ain't broke in till a hundred-thousand
'Yee-haw' and 'amen' were meant to be shouted
Round here every single blessing gets counted

[Chorus]
Don't get any better from where I'm sitting
Sunset swingin' with a front porch view
Right about now, ain't a thing I'm missin'
Six string in my hands, right next to you
If we're talking 'bout heaven, this night already been
Baby, you and me forever, that's the way I see it
You and me forever, that's the way I see it

[Bridge]
The way I see it it's a real good life
Looking at you, looking through my eyes

[Chorus]
Don't get any better from where I'm sitting
Sunset swingin' with a front porch view
Right about now, ain't a thing I'm missin'
Six string in my hands, right next to you
If we're talking 'bout heaven, this night already been
Baby, you and me forever, that's the way I see it
You and me forever, that's the way I see it
