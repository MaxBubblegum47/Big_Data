[Pre-Chorus]
Hey lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh lord
The last long day she said goodbye
Well lord, I thought I would cry

[Chorus]
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over;
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

[Verse]
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
I'm In love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
And I tried and tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leaving
This is all I can say
I got a feeling called the blues, oh lord
Since my baby say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh lord
The last long day she said goodbye
Well lord, I thought I would cry

[Chorus]
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over;
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues
