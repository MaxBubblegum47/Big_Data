[Verse 1]
Don't get me wrong, it's pretty cool to be on TV
So all the folks back home can see me
And that I'm livin' it out
All the things I used to dream about
Yeah, it's pretty great, singin' on a stage
Proud 'cause there ain't an empty seat in the place
But, girl, ever since I met you
I got a whole new perspective

[Chorus]
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl
Nothin' wrong with the center of attention
Long as I'm with you, I don't mind the pictures
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I hope the first question people ask me
Is "How's your girl and how's your family?"
I could go on and on and on
Talkin' 'bout you for days
You can bet when I hear, "Congratulations"
Want it to be because we made it
Another five years
Best thing I got is right here

[Chorus]
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl
Nothin' wrong with the center of attention
Long as I'm with you, I don't mind the pictures
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Ooh, famous for lovin' you, ooh
If I'm gonna be famous for somethin'
I wanna be famous for lovin' you
If I'm gonna be known around the world
I wanna because of you, girl
And if I'm gonna go down in history
I hope it's all 'cause of you and me
If I'm gonna be famous for somethinâ€™
Girl, I wanna be famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you
Famous for lovin' you
