[Verse 1]
Yeah, she likes how sweet I like my sweet tea
And she likes my boots with these blue jeans
And she likes poppin' buttons on my pearl snap
And she likes my cowboy hat

[Chorus]
But she loves me for my twang
Reminds her of a little Hank
When she hears me on the radio
She knows that it's me by the way I sing
She loves me for my twang
Loves me for my twang

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she likes how good I pick a guitar
And she likes when I play her my songs
And she tells me I'm gonna be a big star
She's always singin' along

[Chorus]
She loves me for my twang
Reminds her of a little Hank
When she hears me on the radio
She knows that it's me by the way I sing
She loves me for my twang
Loves me for my twang

[Bridge]
Yeah, she likes how good I pick a guitar
She's always singing along

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves me for my twang
Reminds her of a little Hank
When she hears me on the radio
She knows that it's me by the way I sing

[Chorus]
She loves me for my twang
Reminds her of a little Hank
When she hears me on the radio
She knows that it's me by the way I sing
She loves me for my twang
Loves me for my twang
