[Intro: Rick Ross]
R.I.P. to all the real niggas worldwide!
Salute! Real shit

[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]
I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas, dawg (Dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg
I ride for my niggas

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Damn, life's so short
Fuck it, I don't wanna go to court (Huh!)
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer, though
Fuck it, I'm on the run for the month (Woo!)
I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil' niggas thuggin', even got me paranoid (Huh!)
I'm gettin' money, that's in any nigga category
Double M, I got Gs out in California (Huh!)

[Chorus: Rick Ross, French Montana, & Drake]
I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas, dawg (Dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin' (Yeah), niggas tryna get at me, dawg
(Young Frankie Geechi Liberace, yeah)
I ride for my niggas

[Verse 2: Drake & Rick Ross]
It bothers me when the gods get to actin' like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don't be duckin' like you never wanted nothin'
It's feelin' like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from D.C., that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million-dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty Ms
Kobe my nigga, I hate it had to be him
Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym
(Huh! Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said "fuck it," I'm tearin' holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix, and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em, "Butterfly it, she'll love it."
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin' my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fuckin' finish line; we can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker gettin' mine off rap, with my niggas (Huh!)

[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]
I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas (Maybach Music)
I slide for my niggas, dawg (Dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg
I ride for my niggas

[Verse 3: French Montana]
From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dawg (Huh)
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog (Huh)
Dwight Howard on the post, dawg (Huh)
My niggas got the powder through the post, dawg (Huh)
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head (Huh)
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the feds (Huh)
Ten grams off my last 250 now (Huh)
Big-ass crib, 250 down, damn!
Gave my nigga Max 7-5 (Huh)
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30 (Huh)
Fuck it, got me thinkin' like I'm 7-5 (Huh)
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30

[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]
Huh, I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas (Maybach Music)
I slide for my niggas, dawg (Dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg
I ride for my niggas
