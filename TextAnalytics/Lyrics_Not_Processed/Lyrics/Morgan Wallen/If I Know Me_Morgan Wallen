[Verse 1]
You say you need a couple credits 'fore they'll let you out of college
I bet you bought that beer with your Daddy's card
You're looking like you probably get a little tired of all this
Attention that you're getting when you go to the bar

[Pre-Chorus]
We can take a different route
I know you're from a different town
But you're here for now
So whatcha say we get on out and see where this night leads?

[Chorus]
If I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Bet I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate's home
Honey, when the sun come peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
If I know me, if I know me (Woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
This ain't some routine that I use every Friday
This ain't a one line, one night kiss and tell
But ever since I caught you looking over my way
All that I could do was tell myself

[Chorus]
If I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Bet I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate's home
Honey, when the sun come peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
If I know me (Woah, woah)

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh)
And I could just change my mind
And leave my number in your phone (Ooh, ooh)
And give you a kiss goodnight
And go home alone

[Chorus]
But if I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Bet I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate's home
Honey, when the sun come peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
'Cause I know me
