[Verse 1]
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's, "Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now"
Fightin' words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

[Bridge]
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
The way I talk
