[Verse: Lana Del Rey]
I had a vision
A vision of my nails in the kitchen
Scratching counter tops, I was screaming
My back arched like a cat
My position couldn't stop, you were hitting it
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it (I love it), star boy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy

[Outro: The Weeknd]
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
