[Verse 1: Noah Cyrus]
You just made the worst mistake
And you'll regret it, darling
'Cause once you give and then you take
You'll only end up wanting

[Pre-Chorus: Noah Cyrus]
Was everything hard enough?
'Cause one day you'll wake up
And then you'll say

[Chorus 1: Noah Cyrus]
“I wanna be your lover
I don't wanna be your friend”
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone, my dear
So tell me that you love me again (Tell me that you love me again)
I, I wanna be your lover
Baby, I'll hold my breath
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone, my dear
So tell me that you love me again (Tell me that you love me)

[Post-Chorus: Noah Cyrus with XXXTENTACION]
Again, babe, again
Again, babe, again
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone, my dear
So tell me that you love me again

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Ooh, she's screaming in my head
Ooh, I left her where I slept
Somewhere, I can't escape, I'm running from myself (Ooh)
Somewhere in between in love and broken, I'm in hell

[Chorus 2: Noah Cyrus & XXXTENTACION]
Saying "I wanna be your lover, I don't wanna be your friend"
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone, my dear
So tell me that you love me again (Tell me that you love me again)
I, I wanna be your lover
You'll leave when the clock hits ten
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone, my dear
So tell me that you love me again (Tell me that you love me)

[Post-Chorus: Noah Cyrus & XXXTENTACION]
Again, babe, again
Again, babe, again
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone, my dear
So tell me that you love me again (Tell me that you love me)
Again, babe, again
Again, babe, again
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone my dear
So tell me that you love me again (Tell me that you love me again)
