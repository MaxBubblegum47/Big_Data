[Verse 1]
I took your heart
I did things to you only lovers would do in the dark
It made you a God
Priests, popes, and preachers would tell me I did it wrong
But hey
You made a negro flip
What do I say
To make me exist?
Oh, stranger

[Chorus]
Still don't know my name
You still don't know my name (Woo)
And I would die your slave
Baby, right now
But you still don't know my name
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Wish you, wish you'd come over, mmm
Miss you, kiss you in make-believe
I'm dreamin' of all of the possibilities
I'm kissing all over your body, my Nefertiti
And every time I think the planets aligning
You're still so close, but yet so far

[Chorus]
Still don't know my name
You still don't know my name (Woo)
And I would die your slave
Baby, right now
But you still don't know my name
Yeah
