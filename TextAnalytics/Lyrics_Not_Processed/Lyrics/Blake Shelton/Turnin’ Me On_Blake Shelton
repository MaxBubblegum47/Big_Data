[Verse 1]
Her kisses taste like whiskey
Burning through my veins
She don't know how to miss me
She hits right where she aims
Baby's got my number and she's calling me up
Knows what she's doing with a single touch

[Chorus]
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes, I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on

[Verse 2]
Knows how to set me on fire
She's always holding the match
And when my body's beside hers
There ain't no turning back
She's Revlon red in the blackest night
Lighting up the room in the world just like

[Chorus]
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on

[Bridge]
Once she gets it started, man, it's all night long
She's the needle on the vinyl of a midnight song
She's turning me on, turning me on

[Chorus]
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on, yeah

[Outro]
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Ooh, ooh, ooh
