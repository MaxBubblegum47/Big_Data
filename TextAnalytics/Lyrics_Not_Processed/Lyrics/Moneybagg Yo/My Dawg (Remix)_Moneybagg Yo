[Intro: Lil Baby]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Yeah that's my dawg for sure

Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Deja keep on callin'
She say she ready to pull up
As soon as I get there, walk in
I'ma put her in a full nelson
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quarter million dollars on the Benz
I paid half a million for the coupe
Then I gave a whole ten to my mans
That's my dawg so I know he gon' shoot (Shoot)
That's my dawg, nigga who you? (Roof)
Eat 'em up, call that dog food
Name one spot we ain't ran through (Spot)
Piss in the trap, that's what dogs do
My bitch keep callin' my phone
When I pull up home I put her in a figure four
I got a trap bitch, tat on her ass, and it say Huncho
I give her the bag and she movin' fast, she not comin' home no more
I put your ho on a string for real, she come back like yo-yo
We hit 'em three in a row (Smash)
Ice on her neck too froze
That's my dawg for sure (Dawg)
My dawg be strapped to a pole (Strap)
No internet blog, no no
No tweets in the streets (No tweets in the streets)
Niggas can't be beat (No, can't beat)
So I iced the Phillipe (Iced it)

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Quavo]
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg (My dawg)
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row (Smash)
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row (My dawg)
Deja keep on callin'
She say she ready to pull up
As soon as I get there, walk in
I'ma put her in a full nelson
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you

[Verse 2: MoneyBagg Yo]
Soon's a nigga walk through the door
Put her ass in a figure four
Bust a nut then poured a four
Pulled off, made her serve at the store
Niggas throwin' shots, tryna get to me
I ain't really into Twitter beef
I'ma catch up with you in the streets
I'm tryna run up my M's for real
I'm tryna run up my M's
It ain't no talkin', ain't no debatin'
Bust on 'em soon as I see 'em
I did a show and turned up that bitch with a pocket rocket in my Timb'
Haters, I don't even see 'em
Cash money like I'm Slim
Get your weight up like the gym
Shawty constantly hittin' up the phone
Sendin' texts, talkin' 'bout I'm wrong
Yeah I'm on my way, but I can't stay
I gotta go home to bae
I can't be fuckin' these hoes in the city
'Cause they can't stay in they place
Lil bitch thought she was somewhere outer space
When she looked at the roof in the Wraith

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Deja keep on callin'
She say she ready to pull up
As soon as I get there, walk in
I'ma put her in a full nelson
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
Audemar Piguet wet
Diamonds get these bitches wet
Fat knots make a bitch fuck somethin'
Ass shots make a nigga cuff somethin'
One-sixty on my hair, I'm gleaming
Every time that I step I'm bleeding
Crackers get behind me, I'm speeding
That's my dawg so you know we fleeing
Shawty said she got a bone to pick
Who's this ho I been rollin' with?
Everybody callin' her phone and shit
Know me better, I don't know the bitch
Free my dogs in the cages
I'm a project lil' baby
In the projects with Lil Baby
I used to tote three-eighties
Now I tote twelve gauges
Got my Charger whip ajudicated
I'm too smooth baby
Trust me you don't need to lubricate it
My lil' snipers say them niggas be hatin' ever since you done made it
I don't know why, 'cause I could've bought the Wraith but I bought a new Mercedes
I just bought a new Mercedes, but I could've bought the Wraith
'Cause I gotta feed my family, make sure everybody ate
Make sure everybody straight, 'cause you gotta feed the team
Boy you gotta spread the cheese, boy you gotta split the cake
Don't feed your dogs, they gon' get hungry and go to lickin' on your plate
Make sure my dawg don't turn out to a mutt, he gon' be a Great Dane
That part, that's my dawg like Clifford
My dawg, my goddamn nigga
You can bring your dawg, I'ma Vick him
Don't step too hard, I'ma sic him

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Deja keep on callin'
She say she ready to pull up
As soon as I get there, walk in
I'ma put her in a full nelson
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you

[Outro]
Dawgs
Just me and my dawgs
We gon' take 'em down two in a row
We gon' take 'em down two in a row
We gon' take 'em down two in a row
Just me and my dawgs
