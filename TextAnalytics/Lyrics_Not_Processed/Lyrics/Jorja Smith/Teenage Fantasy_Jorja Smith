[Verse 1]
You weren't the boy I thought I knew
Maybe I was blind, I was young, I didn't have a clue
You were the topic of my lunch times
I'd bore the girls about our chats
And get upset when you didn't text back
I was warned by my brothers to find another lover
Stop falling for these boys who didn't want the same as me
And I was warned by my brothers to find another lover
Stop falling for these boys who didn't want the same as me

[Chorus]
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it

[Verse 2]
I've got a lot of things to do
What if I had been a fool and thought I was in love with you
I need to grow and find myself before I let somebody love me
Because at the moment I don't know me
When I was told by my father, if I look into the future
Do I really see this boy, that I think I've fallen for?
And I was told by my mother, if I look into the future
Do I really see this boy, that I think I've fallen for?

[Chorus]
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it, no
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it

[Bridge]
When we are young, we all want someone
Who we think is the one, just to fit in
There's no need to rush, take your time
Life's a big old ride, sit back and enjoy the vibe
When we are young, we all want someone
Who we think is the one, just to fit in
There's no need to rush, take your time
Life's a big old ride, sit back and enjoy the vibe

[Outro]
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it
We all want a teenage fantasy
Want it when we can't have it
When we got it we don't seem to want it
