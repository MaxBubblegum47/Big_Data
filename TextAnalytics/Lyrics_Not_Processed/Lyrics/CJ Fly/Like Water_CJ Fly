(Capital STEEZ, Rest in peace)

[Intro: Common]
They say signs of the end is near

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
And I quote, we came like them niggas in boats
Still think it's a joke? Your third eye vision is broke
We lifted from smoke and floating, that's how I got my aura open
Check the horoscopes, though; you could say I'm horror scoping
You catch me floating on a four-leaf clover
That's the pot of gold so we sonnin' them like Maury Povich
We gone need paternity tests I guess
Cause them vets ain't learning it step-by-step
It's Beast Coast, we the murderous set
We raining fire, and I don't mean the burners and techs
You gotta love it, all 47 of us
You ain't got a number, then I guess we gotta get you covered
I'm connecting to my brethren with the
West side connection cause he say he got the best there
We got the birds like 2-4-7
So I'm a hit you back in a second, cause we already

[Bridge: Capital STEEZ & Joey Bada$$]
Lifted, we lifted, we lifted, you dreamt it
We lived it, we lived it, we lived it, so we already
Lifted, we lifted, we lifted, we dreamt it
We lived it, we lifted

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Said you could run, but my niggas will still erase ya
Everywhere I go, they just copy and paste us
Pace yourself, wanksta you ain't like that ain't ya? Kerosene for your
Chaser, waste yourself, and thank your boy
Shots on me, I'm not drunk, let me explain my story
I'm not under, I'm higher than who my connect employ
Said for sure he got fire, most dankest, take a whiff
The gracious, he never lace the shit, take a trip
To the astrals, welcome to my land 
It's your first OBE? Tell me how has your body been?
Spinning wheels on the axle of my embodiment, 
Don't waste your breath, you can't BS, we know what your body meant
Through third eye codes, your third eye closed
If Steve Jobs made you purchase a third iPhone
All seeing eyes know what eye means
But 33 degrees can't make us freeze
Said they watered us down so they forced to believe
That they won us through force and greed
Eye said they warning us now so of course they need to be
Wanting a force to lead
They watered us down so they forces believe
That they won us through force and greed

[Bridge: Capital STEEZ & Joey Bada$$]
Said we already lifted, we lifted, we lifted, we dreamt it
We lived it

[Verse 3: CJ Fly]
I'm opening up my chakras; it's potent enough I chop it
I'm pointing out all impostors plotting to block my commas, trying to calm us
Down, but it ain't happening, we mad as shit
Still managing, girl can I bust if I got cannabis?
A half a zip could have her pants unzipped
Ain't enough romantic shit, so don't be sadden if you couldn't have a kiss
I'm still a bastard kid with blackened lips; I'm still a
Pacifist, but if you ask for it, then I could pass a fist
You don't smoke -ism, I'll introduce you, not a buddah
Abuser, feel like a Bad Boy when I take two puffs, I and I
Be stoned so Mary Jane is like Medusa, had keys
For dough, would have thought he was a super, but that's when I grew up
To realize I'm in a place to be
Made vacancy and still the emcee, they know they can't see, we part of the
Resistance, we'll fix things, persistence, we shifting
We drifting, we lifted

[Outro: Nas]
From the spliff that I lift -
From the spliff that I lift -
From the spliff that I lift and inhale
