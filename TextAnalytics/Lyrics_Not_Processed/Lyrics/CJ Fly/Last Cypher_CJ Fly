[Intro: CJ Fly]
Yo yo yo yo pros
Y'all try'na cypher right quick, what up bruh bruh bruh?

[Hook: CJ Fly]
I said, who wanna cypher in the room tonight? grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright
I said, who wanna cypher in the room tonight? grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Said we were just a bunch of kids, like the Brady Bunch
Style so miscellanous, cats taking speed ain't in a lane with us
Favorite line of quotes/coats you can hang em up
You straight whats up, I don't know I wrote this statement cuz
It was stating just, how homie he was fakin tough
So I gave him lumps, beat him up, broke his jaw
He claimed he got jumped
Got on an orange suit it hurt to see my mans in cuffs
It goes to show how these Brooklyn streets were dangerous
Niggas ain't playin' son, come round here shining its the timing
When things get violent, eyelids violet
, whenever they violate
That's why my style been to be silent
Unless they want the shaolin
I came into this game and ate with no one to make my plate
Said my grace, figured that they must not know what art is
Cause we just starvin' artists who become someone they all test
To them I'm just a target but I'm solid just like tar get, uh
I'm doing wonderfully you make these bitches want to flea

[Verse 2: Dyemond Lewis]
I be flippin' the bird to the public, I'm holding grudges
I'm always angry, and I dunno who to blame
So I blame the government, you gotta love it
Another youngin' that sufferin' 
I told him to fuck the world
And made somethin' from nothing
Come and see how he come in the game like an intrusion
Who's him DeShay supply the beats so I bruise'em, oozin
I'm losin' my self control, you niggas is lightweight
We times ten to four, and we bend the rules
They act like they dont know, who the Pro Era crew is?
Who Diamond Lou is, coming for they flesh we leave them left like nudist
And if you new to this you'd see I show you the ropes
I'll be your PE coach
, you know you see this smoke
How you think I'm smashing records like the CD broke, 
See Dee
In the back of the stu catching a view of the environment
I over analyze shit entirely

[Verse 3: A La $ole]
It be that young De Niro, get chicks like I get dinero
You scare hoes to the point they don't wanna get near yours
Bare flows pour'd over earlobes
Fo sure, I flow in air zones, I'm one in the same you bare clones
Coast to coastal, get mami's like I'm 'posed to, go postal when we oppose you, so don't pose dude
I approach fools with tools, leave em in cork screws
Then resume the cruise, my hand on the boob will bruise
When we interlude, she get nude for cash dough, and jewels
And I pursue, put my tube in her inner room (kaboom), Two open root chakras sex the best, so you know I get lots of
Fuck em and I duck em, never in my pivotal
I'ma love Doc. given out my persciptionals
It's the principals, I'm the prince of cool, I love broads
But I'm a young Don, so my nigga only get physical

[Hook: CJ Fly]
Who wanna cypher in the room tonight? Grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright
I said, who wanna cypher in the room tonight? Grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright
I said, who wanna cypher in the room tonight? Grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright
I said, who wanna cypher in the room tonight? Grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright

[Verse 4: Dessy Hinds]
Now as the drum kick basses, break faces
And the vibe take you places, here comes a track that niggas couldn't be tracing
From the end of mind known to trickle down your inner spine
And make these non alcoholic girls do a little wine
And in the midst of time, spittin rhymes was a trick of mine
From the effect of joints, minimize the squinted eyes
Never needed to be even to reasons
The only nigga only breathing from God
With a mental demon screamin in winter seasons
Had to reflect as the style comes correct
So it comes correct
Better than cum correct when I'm done for sex
Better text the less
So the text got the message
When a nigga bring more down from his pores
Without a single blemish, let him embellish every
Letter for ever with this 
soliloquy
, thus spittin are your suspicions, suspiciously
Come and cop the little weed, cause niggas got higher from
Single bigger beads and climb the single tree

[Verse 5: Nyck Caution]
Said I be thrown up on this plateau, mobbin with my capos
Its all about the booty like sparrow, get your arrows
Cause the bose know that the fuckin pros ho
Wait, sippin slow so, slow mo, seems to be our fate uh
Rhythm rhythm got me high as fuck
See my stock risen up, I be never findin' trust
But I found myself through the light, eyes thrice
Jumped and got ups like delivery trucks,
 I'm sick of
Cereal shmucks from the imperial clubs, offering lineal love
I'm treat it like a domino, and knock 'em down
I don't give a literal fuck
Your minerals suck, I'm a lyrical stud
Uh, look, and don't tell me what it really be
Cause all I see is indigo and symmetry
Endo road, I end yo' road
And if your lend your soul, expect the death for sho

[Verse 6: Kirk Knight]
Eh yo lets go, analytically you can see through my energy
I been ascendin', higher than my fuckin' enemies
We all gods in our mind, body and soul
Don't get caught up in 360's or you will be sold
And I don't play that shit, but PE be the BEP
Cream of the crops' circle, alienated
And I know that's my ultimatum, I know its bitter sweet
And word to the streets, its either you or me
And I'ma fuckin' eat
So check your co-sign, before I Rocafella
But they don't touch the cheddar, cause they all know better
This is the fruit of my labor so watch the land grow through my eye lids
Centrifuging, not confusing through in my intellect
And my 
Kundalini
 need my Melanin, so baby put the melon in
Or magnesium, you niggas tarnish, smell em
Your am radio active no fair

[Hook: CJ Fly]
Who wanna cypher in the room tonight? Grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright
I said, who wanna cypher in the room tonight? Grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright
I said, who wanna cypher in the room tonight? Grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright
I said, who wanna cypher in the room tonight? Grab the mic
Everything is gonna be alright

[Verse 7: Rokamouth]
If they hop on the dick, make sure you protect it
Watch how you step, plenty shit you can step in
And no disrepectin if you ain't in your section
Better watch how you talk, you stalkin my bredrin
47 goons come cool with no prevention from the coolers of the dimensions
Just mention, that you let them bring the best of your ascension
Like last night I rode the train, just to vibe
As I stood between the cars spliff in a knot
Having visions of spittin these rhymes on the mic
As I open my eyes to see lies that they hide
On that 47 shit I climb and survive and been through these rhymes
Definin through times, line by line guidin all your right lines
To find your right vibe need to get your hustle up and find your right grind
Find your right grind like

[Verse 8: Joey Bada$$]
I take tokes of the marijuana smoke 'til I float like boats in the ocean
For sure, I'm showboatin'
Slow pokes get slow poked over me
Just a kid, wait your kidding right? Nigga no joking
Too much commotion broke folk just won't stop 
talkin'
Can't play his cards right I just might poke 'em
Cause where I'm from, hearts don't get broken they got stolen
Say the wrong sentence, nigga put a semi to your colon
Paws that like dog feet, spit it sicker than bone meat
Fuck the world in orgies until that bitch bore me
My flow horny, my game nice, my style naughty
One eye low though, he'll figure that out shortly
I speak the truth and she knew this since birth
It's her nature to look like she newest to Earth, stupid
It don't take cupid, all it takes is cool kids
Some cats prey on pussy like cougars

[Verse 9: Capital STEEZ]
It all seems fictitious dreamin' with my team for the riches
They say to watch out, for the schemin' ass bitches
You better keep a lot of cream for them itches
I'm too vicious, in a stream full of fishes
So I move with the waters like my niggas that manuever with a quarters
I skimped the last order, so you can call dueces if you want in
A few Coronas got me seein' future in my aura
The future I'm controlling with my mind and my myriads
If you talkin' shit then let me fly to the pyramids
She feel nasty when she swallow the little kids
That means we had a minor outer body experience
Sticks and stones can't break my bones
So I alone cones like 47 chromes
The synchronologist, now we in the zone
In the middle of space time so tell 'em hit my phone
