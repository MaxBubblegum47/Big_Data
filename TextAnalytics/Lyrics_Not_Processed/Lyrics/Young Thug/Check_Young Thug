[Intro: Young Thug & Skooly]
I can see that bullshit from a mile away (See it)
You can stack my money 'bout a mile away (Stack it)
I got three white bitches like it's powder day (White)
Mink coat with the rolls like a Shar Pei
And all of my bitches sexy, call them Barbies (Sexy)
She lookin' back like I'm flexin', baby, no way (Uh-uh)
And lately, I been on that D'usse, yee
(We got London on the track)

[Chorus]
Got me a check, I got a check
Yeah, I done got me a check, I got a check (Sheesh, sheesh)
Yeah, I done got me a check, I got a check (Sheesh)
Yeah, I done got me a check, oh, got a check (Yeah, yeah-yeah!)

[Post-Chorus]
Money on my mind, I got money on my brain
Money in my pants, I got money I call change
20, 50, 100, 500 millions made
Big hunna Thugga, screamin' free that Gucci Mane

[Verse 1]
If I need some racks, I'ma flip me some packs
I talk like I want and she don't say nothin' back
If cops pull up, I put that crack in my crack
Or I put that brack in my brack
Call little shawty, made her fuck on my brodie
If you don't owe me, bitch, still act like you owe me
I promise I won't ever quit, bitch, I'm Kobe
And I whip that white, you can snow me
Stoner Young Thugger

I pull up in Bentleys with London, they all want to meet him
Yeah, they all wanna greet him
They pull down they pants and they all wanna eat him, uh
No, they won't tease on that dick, they won't read on that dick
They won't leash on that dick, don't Felicia that dick
Mamacita that dick, they gon' snitch on that dick
And she screamin' loud, she can't secret that dick

Eat that, lil' bitch, I'ma feast that lil' bitch, mm

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'm a Migo, I play with kilo
When I put ice on, I am Sub-Zero
All of my niggas, they hard, call 'em beetles
Niggas was fake so I kept me a Ruger in Regals
Droppin' the top on the Bentley
I'm with the Birdman, yeah, the eagle
Geeked out my mind, man, I'm tripping out
I don't know none of these people
Make my little shawty go get me a four and bring back me a liter
Yes, I got threats, I'm not worried 'bout that
They know they can get whacked and I swear I done

[Chorus]
Got me a check, I got a check
Yeah, I done got me a check, I got a check (Sheesh, sheesh)
Yeah, I done got me a check, I got a check (Sheesh)
Yeah, I done got me a check, oh, got a check (Yeah, yeah-yeah!)

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I need racks
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I want racks
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I need racks, hey!
