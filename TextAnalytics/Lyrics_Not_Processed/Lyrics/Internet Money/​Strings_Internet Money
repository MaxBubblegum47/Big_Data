[Chorus: iann dior]
She tried to pull on my strings (Strings)
Shawty got cut from the team (Uh-huh)
Get litty, causin' a scene (Scene)
Shawty a fool on the bean (Bean)
I tried to make you my queen (Uh-huh)
Birkins and diamonds are cheap (Uh-huh)
Girl, that ain't nothing to me (Uh-huh)
You were the one on his tweet (Uh-huh)

[Post-Chorus: iann dior]
I thought you'd never let me go
You switched on me, I lost control
I hope I see you on the road
So you can see how far I dove

[Verse 1: iann dior]
So deep in the water (Drip)
My bitch call me Poppa (Yeah)
Count the money up like Cartons (No-no)
If we die young, we martyrs (Woah)
You was a ratchet ho (Mhm)
Put you in designer clothes (All day)
See me in the streets, don't bother (No way)
Cut the bitch off like barbers
I dove

[Pre-Chorus: iann dior]
In the water, yeah, in the water
I'm a rock star, bitch, throwin' water
In the water, yeah, in the water
I don't bother, bitch

[Chorus: iann dior]
She tried to pull on my strings (Strings)
Shawty got cut from the team (Uh-huh)
Get litty, causin' a scene (Scene)
Shawty a fool on the bean (Bean)
(I tried to) I tried to make you my queen (Uh-huh)
Birkins and diamonds are cheap (Uh-huh)
Girl, that ain't nothing to me (Uh-huh)
You were the one on his tweet (Uh-huh)

[Post-Chorus: iann dior]
I thought you'd never let me go
You switched on me, I lost control
I hope I see you on the road
So you can see how far I dove

[Verse 2: Gunna]
See how a rich nigga move (Rich nigga move)
Hoppin' out the Bentley Coupé (Bentley Coupé)
Oh, and it got a missing roof (Yeah)
She freaky when she sip Grey Goose (Sip Grey Goose)
I'm diggin' in the pussy, feel loose
I'm in charge, fuckin' bitch by the twos (Uh-huh-huh)
Let the first say, tell me, what's the move? (What the move?)
Popped a Perc', now gettin' in the groove (Pop a Perc')
Didn't finish my first day of school (Yeah)
Wanna drop out, I'ma take you on a cruise (Take you on a cruise)
Sellin' Percs like I'm workin' at Lou's (Yeah)
I'ma get the money, I ain't never gon' lose (Never gon')
I'ma get that money, I got hundreds, all blues
When you keep it comin', all these bitches gon' choose (Oh)
She want me fuck her, smack her on the ass 'til it bruise
She want me fuck her, smack her on the ass 'til it bruise

[Chorus: iann dior]
She tried to pull on my strings (Strings)
Shawty got cut from the team (Uh-huh)
Get litty, causin' a scene (Scene)
Shawty a fool on the bean (Bean)
(I tried to) I tried to make you my queen (Uh-huh)
Birkins and diamonds are cheap (Uh-huh)
Girl, that ain't nothing to me (Uh-huh)
You were the one on his tweet (Uh-huh)

[Post-Chorus: iann dior]
I thought you'd never let me go
You switched on me, I lost control
I hope I see you on the road
So you can see how far I dove
