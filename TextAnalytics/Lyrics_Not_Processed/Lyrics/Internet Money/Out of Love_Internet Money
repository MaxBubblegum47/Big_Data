[Pre-Chorus]
It's my love, it's your love, it's our love
And I be thinkin' the world is out of love
So lovestruck, it's fucked up
And she don't really care because

[Chorus]
Everybody want the same thing
New chain, new car, and the same ring
I just wanna make money with the same gang
New glass, new frame, but the same lane
Whole team cope different, but the same pain
Rollie, Rollie, Rollie, I just want a plain jane
Bitches fuckin' different niggas for the same fame
I'm committed to myself, nigga, so I can't change

[Post-Chorus]
She wanna pop it, lock it, drop it
I'm so up, baby, stop it
Tinted windows ridin' 'round 'cause I'm poppin'
She wanna come, mop it
Showin' no love, toxic
Baby, can't trust, be honest
She want me to hit it, no boxin'
Pass the grip, toss it

[Verse]
Hop in the Bentley, the 'Rari, the Mulsanne
You got a problem with me, you can come say it
Pass the lil' thottie off, I had to relay it
Now when they say my name, they be like, "He made it"
Oh shit, that's Tecca, that boy up in NY
I'm really from Queens, but they say I'm from LI
Sixth grade up in two thirty-one with my fellas
It's so sad, when I moved out the hood, we all fell out

[Bridge]
Obvious that we don't give a fuck
They used to stick me up
And now they showin' up
And now they showin' love
I'm gettin' love from up above
No, no, don't hit me up
No, no, don't hit me up, no, no

[Chorus]
Everybody want the same thing
New chain, new car, and the same ring
I just wanna make money with the same gang
New glass, new frame, but the same lane
Whole team cope different, but the same pain
Rollie, Rollie, Rollie, I just want a plain jane
Bitches fuckin' different niggas for the same fame
I'm committed to myself, nigga, so I can't change

[Post-Chorus]
She wanna pop it, lock it, drop it
I'm so up, stop it
Tinted windows ridin' 'round 'cause I'm poppin'
She wanna come, mop it
Showin' no love, toxic
Baby, can't trust, be honest
Want me to hit it, no boxin'
Pass the grip, toss it

[Pre-Chorus]
It's my love, it's your love, it's our love
And I be thinkin' the world is out of love
So lovestruck, it's fucked up
And she don't really care because

[Chorus]
Everybody want the same thing
New chain, new car, and the same ring
And I just wanna make money with the same gang
New glass, new frame, but the same lane
And whole team cope different, but the same pain
Rollie, Rollie, Rollie, I just want a plain jane
Bitches fuckin' different niggas for the same fame
I'm committed to myself, nigga, so I can't change

[Outro]
Obvious that we don't give a fuck
They used to stick me up, stick me up
I'm gettin' love from up above
No, no, don't hit me up, hit me up, oh
