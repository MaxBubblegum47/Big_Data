[Intro: iann dior & Trippie Redd]
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' (Yeah)

[Chorus: iann dior]
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fucking with you ain't last that long
Now you gone, now you gone, now you gone, girl

[Verse 1: iann dior]
Tell me what it is, made my heart break
Saying that it's me, but you know it ain't
Took a few pills, I can't feel a thing
Got me in my feels, sippin' on drank
Tryna keep it real, girl, you really ain't
You know what's the deal, you can't get a thing
Saying that it hurts, tryin' to the game
Saying I'm a joke, laughin' to the bank

[Pre-Chorus: iann dior]
I need your love
I need your touch
I need you right now
I need you right now

[Chorus: iann dior]
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fucking with you ain't last that long
Now you gone, now you gone, now you gone, girl

[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
I just want the love, baby, not the lust
Caught up in a daze, man, I need your trust
All up in a maze, left you in the dust
Gone in a wraith, see the stars in a wraith
You see the stars in the day, bitch
Have you been to Mars on a date, bitch?
I can take yo ass to Mars in a day, bitch
I can take yo ass to Mars today, bitch, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: iann dior & Trippie Redd]
I need your love
I need your touch
I need you right now (Yeah)
I need you right now (Yeah)

[Chorus: iann dior]
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fucking with you ain't last that long
Now you gone, now you gone, now you gone, girl
