[Pre-Chorus: Don Toliver]
Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey
These bitches, they hate, and you can't miss what you never had, hey, hey

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
Off the juice (Juice), codeine got me trippin' (Juice)
Copped the coupe (Coupe), woke up, roof is missin' (Yeah)
Ice (Ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (Ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'

[Verse 1: NAV]
Addy boys, got some sixties in my bag (Addy)
Lips sealed, I ain't pillow talkin', I'm no rat (No)
In my earlobe, got two karats, VVS (Bling)
Got a penthouse near Rodeo off of stress (Stress)
All this money, when I grew up, I had nothing (Nothing)
Filled with backstabbers, my old life was disgusting (Disgusting)
Can't believe it, gotta thank God that I'm livin' comfortably (Thank God)
Gettin' checks, I don't believe her, she say she done with me
Burned some bridges and I let the fire light the way (Oh-woah)
Kickin' my feet up, left the PJs on a PJ (A PJ)
Yeah, I'm a big dawg, and I walk around with no leash (Oh-oh)
I got water on me, yeah, everything on Fiji

[Pre-Chorus: Don Toliver]
Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag

Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey
These bitches, they hate, and you can't miss what you never had, hey, hey

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
Off the juice (Juice), codeine got me trippin' (Juice)
Copped the coupe (Coupe), woke up, roof is missin' (Yeah)
Ice (Ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (Ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin' (Hey, hey)

I'm a rockstar, play guitars 
(Yeah)
, sippin' Wock', hey (Hey)
Adderall, fentanyl, Xanax bars, ayy (Hey)
I was fifteen, I was sippin' codeine with my dawg, ayy (Codeine)
Did a Percocet, Promethazine, I feel gnarly (Promethazine)
Put up a stick and I hop on a plane
Still in my war ways (War ways)
Shit is so risky, I gotta be gifted
He blessed me with fortune and fame (Fortune and fame, nice)
I remember from fifty, I couldn't go back empty
I knew I was stuck to the game (Stuck)
I'm loyal and I'll never change, nah
I'm never gon' go against the grain (Go against the grain)
I'm never gon' be the one to turn on my brother
When police has got us detained (Nah)
I won't ever love a bitch more than my mother
And that's on my government name (Nah)
I can't be no sucker, ain't hatin' on no one
I wish everybody get paid (Paid)
'Cause we countin' up every day (Every day)
Gettin' high 'til I land in the grave
