[Intro: ​iann dior & 
Machine Gun Kelly
]
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a drought, I guess I'll start again
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house (I am my only friend)

[Verse 1: ​iann dior]
Lately, I know I've been a punk and I need to sober up
Double cup, it got me stuck, I think I'm losin' it (Yeah)
'Cause every time that I've been gettin' stuck (I'm stuck)
There's a line inside my head (My head)
Of all my friends, that they've been dead since I made it out

[Pre-Chorus: iann dior]
It's every time that you cross my mind
Remember the times, but I know that you won't ever change
I'm not sobering up, sick and tired of love
If you draw that line, bae, I hope you know I'm crossin' it

[Chorus: ​iann dior & 
Machine Gun Kelly
]
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a drought, I guess I'll start again
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house, I am my only friend
Over and over again, it's like I never win
Why you puttin' me down? It don't make any sense
I'm not sober again, but I'm tryna pretend
Like everything's alright but it's over with

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I get drunk and interrupt, and my eyes look red
Because I'm mad at myself, I stab the openin'
Lately, everything I say you just tell me is wrong
I told her I won't be here long, I can't hold it in

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Every time you cross my mind
I burn another memory to keep yours inside
I saw us drown like high tide
And everything is nothing if you're not here tonight

[Chorus: ​iann dior & 
Machine Gun Kelly
]
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a drought, I guess I'll start again
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house, I am my only friend
Over and over again, it's like I never win
Why you puttin' me down? It don't make any sense
I'm not sober again, but I'm tryna pretend
Like everything's alright but it's over with
