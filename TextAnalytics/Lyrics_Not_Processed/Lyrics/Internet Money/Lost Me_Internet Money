Hey, when I hopped up in a Wraith that's when you lost me (Yeah, lost me)
Laughing to the bank, I'm lookin' saucy, yeah (Lookin' saucy)
I  don't need no bit', can't do nothing for me (Nothin' for me)
My  brother did a race and now he totin' (Race)
Oh (Oh), you don't know me (You don't know me)
Ridin'  with my niggas or I'm ridin' by my lonely (Skrrt, skrrt)
Pistol totin' (

My bro shot him in the face, he feeling like he Kobe (
Huh?

[Verse 1: iann dior]
When I first blew up, that's when you lost me (That's when you lost me)
New  chain, don't care what it cost me, yeah (Don't care what it cost)
Blew up in your face, you looking salty
Got your main on my line, I left her calling, yeah
And I can never change, I'ma stay the same
Ain't got no time for games, oh
Dealing with the fame getting to my brain
Smoking in a Wraith, woah

[Verse 2: Lil Mosey]
If you lookin', I'm around the way (Way)
Fuck fame, I'm just tryna get paid (Tryna get paid)
But I'm hurt and get out of my face (Lil' bitch)
Was at my worst but I found a way (Oh)
I'm a big scammer, rock star with a hammer (Rock star flow)
Three gram 'Wood, big gas, no bammer (Gas)
Bad bitch with me, take her home, I slam her (Lil' bitch)
I don't do a dance for you, bro, 'bout to slam her (Mm, yeah)

[Verse 3: Lil Skies]
Ball out like Ginóbili
I don't know you, nigga, how you know me?
Not my brother, you too phony
I be on my grind just like I'm Tony
Write my pain when I write these songs
And when I sing it, they gon' sing along
I took some time, I guess I needed space
You say you got a problem, say it to my face, yeah

iann dior
