[Intro: The Kid LAROI]
(Perfect!)
(Internet Money, bitch, hahahaha)
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I remember times when I ain't have shit
No food in my crib, now I live lavish (Oh, no-no-no)
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you, I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
My life been tragic, thank you for askin'
I've seen too many of my fam end up in caskets
I've seen too many of my friends turned into ashes
Wish I still had them
Light a blunt, put it to the sky, I'm tryna get high (High)
They won't stop, look me in my eyes, tell me it's alright (Alright)
Had to cut plenty people off, money on my mind
I can't fuck with 'em, I can't trust nobody but I (Yeah)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I remember times when I ain't have shit (Yeah)
No food in my crib, now I live lavish
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you, I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & The Kid LAROI]
They hate so bad-bad, huh, my money up, they fake as fuck
I know they mad-mad, huh, I still ain't done, I ain't switchin' up
I ain't givin' up, I'm goin' in, word to my friends
I ain't thinking clear, tell me what I did, I just whipped the Benz
I'd give it all back right now just to see you smile
I'd give my hoes back, on slime, just to hear you now
They ain't my friend, ain't my woadie, ain't my dawg
For to get some money be the only reason that they come around
And the top down, everythin' goin' smoothly
Hope they don't try me, come out on top, I'm shootin' 'round
When I'm up in town
Haters after me but got so many of 'em for me (Yeah), I can't let 'em down

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & NBA Youngboy]
I remember times when I ain't have shit (Yeah)
No food in my crib, now I live lavish (Top)
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you, I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would
