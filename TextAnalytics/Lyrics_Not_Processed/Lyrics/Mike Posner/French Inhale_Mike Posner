And you ain't gotta roll one cause its already rolled
Check out my technique, jus weed, let it flow

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I take it to the face, inhale it through my nose
Blowin with the homies on the low
, 
man fuck these hoes
And crack-a-lac, pin it back
What you call a mack who crack a mad bitch like that?
A cracker jack
Im like a florist,
 
tourin like a tourist
Godzilla flyin on a pegasorous
Niggas know about it, even fore I pull it out
I put some fire on it, n now they beggin me to put it out
Im in the hallway, rollin on the purple psyche
I know the in's and out's so I'mma do what the fuck I like
