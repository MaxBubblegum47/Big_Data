[Verse 1: Blackbear]
She only wants the dress inside the magazine
She thinks that ever after she'll be living happily
And this sudden curiosity you have for me
Show me something 'bout your personality
Ooh, and these cars, and clothes and calories
To her it’s just an everyday reality
So, what is you want, girl?
What is it you want, out of me?

[Chorus: Blackbear; Tyler Carter]
'Cause maybe it's the SoCo
Maybe it's the Hennessy
Maybe it's the fast life
Maybe it's the limousines
Maybe it's the good weed
Maybe it's the nicotine
Maybe she's a dancer
Maybe she's a beauty queen
All these cars and clothes and calories (Yeah)
All these, cars and clothes and calories, yeah

[Verse 2: Tyler Carter]
She only wants to fuck my ego
We all know everything there is to know about her: gold digger
As the pile of money gets bigger, all the girls get richer
Sip, sippin' on Conja like Luda
Have her feeling sweet like sugar
Lick it off your body
Drip it low, I can give you what you want
You could be my Christina Milian from 2004
(That was okay, yeah? I ain't playing, I'm for real)
Uh, yuh, I wanna make a request, I wanna feel blessed
I wanna get you out of that dress
It’s all about the way that you move
To make a man wanna spend it on you
Work hard, play hard, that’s what you do
And baby love, Miss Independent
Could do it on her own, but she feels like a princess
That’s alright 'cause she takes the crown
Yeah, when she, uh

[Chorus: Blackbear]
'Cause maybe it's the SoCo
Maybe it's the Hennessy
Maybe it's the fast life
Maybe it's the limousines
Maybe it's the good weed
Maybe it's the nicotine
Maybe she's a dancer
Maybe she's a beauty queen
All these cars and clothes and calories
All these, cars and clothes and calories, yeah
