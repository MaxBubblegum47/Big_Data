[Verse 1]
I could see a million faces
I could been a million places
See every season change
But I made up my mind
Spotlight on the center stage
All alone and my thoughts replaying
Same feeling, just a different day
Still got you on my mind

[Chorus]
I'll give you the time, if you're ready to leave
But when you say that it's over
No, it's not over for me
When you're done with your searching
And you know what you need
When it's finally over, I hope you find me
When it's finally over, I hope you find me

[Verse 2]
Do you feel me when you feel the breeze?
Do you see me when you fall asleep?
Do you need me and begin to reach when you realize I'm not there
'Cause I know we were meant to be
And it makes it easy to believe that
You'll be coming back to me from wherever you are

[Chorus]
I'll give you the time, if you're ready to leave
But when you say that it's over
No, it's not over for me
When you're done with your searching
And you know what you need
When it's finally over, I hope you find me
When it's finally over, I hope you find me

[Bridge]
I hope you find me
Oh, I hope you find me
I hope you find me
Oh, I...

[Chorus]
I'll give you the time, if you're ready to leave
But when you say that it's over
No, it's not over for me
When you're done with your searching
And you know what you need
When it's finally over, I hope you find me
When it's finally over, I hope you find me
Finally over, I hope you find me
