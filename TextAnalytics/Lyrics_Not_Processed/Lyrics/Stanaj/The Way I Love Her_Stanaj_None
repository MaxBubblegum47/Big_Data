[Intro]
Stanaj
This is the way I love her
Oh, RedOne
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me

[Verse 1]
Butterflies come out when she opens up her mouth
Never heard more perfect sounds
I'm so deep in I could drown
Her eyes are on my eyes
While that girl is walking by
But I could have that anytime
Baby, you're my only type

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the best
You're the worst
Feels so good and then it hurts
It hurts, oh
I'm blessed, I'm cursed
But it all makes sense to me

[Chorus]
This is the way I love her
Don't wanna touch no other
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
Like I never wanna touch another
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I don't give out my codes
So I wonder how she knows?
How to reach inside of me
Chain me up then set me free
She's a real perfectionist
I know where perfection is
When she climbs on top of me
In the moments no one sees

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the best (You're the best babe)
You're the worst
Feels so good and then it hurts
It hurts, oh
I'm blessed, I'm cursed
But it all makes sense to me

[Chorus]
This is the way I love her
Don't wanna touch no other
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
Like I never wanna touch another
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me

[Bridge]
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her
Like I never wanna touch another
This is the way I love her
Ooh

[Chorus]
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
This is the way I love her (I love you babe)
Like I never wanna touch another
This is the way I love her
Even though it's killing me
