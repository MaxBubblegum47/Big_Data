[Verse 1]
Baby, I know I've been here before
Ohh, something feels familiar
Strange, that when I gaze at you, it's deja-vu
Strange, I never thought I'd feel the way I do
Like my future and my past
Got the same name, got the same eyes
Got the same smile
Maybe in a past life, you were queen
Maybe in my past life, I was king
Maybe we were made eternities ago
And maybe we didn't know
Oohhh

[Chorus]
Stranger things had happened
How strange would it be
If I told you I believe you were made for me
Made for me yeah
Oh, made for me yeah (made for me)
Oh, made for me yeah (made for me)
Made for me, made for me
Ain't it funny how strangers
Became less entangled
And ain't it funny I don't ever wanna let it go
Ain't love strange

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know I've seen you before
It's like staring in a mirror
Strange life, we in a twilight
But it feels so right
Strange that we're never changing
But you changed my life
Maybe you and I possibly could find
That we are divine, heavenly designed
Falling for each other at the same time
Calling to each other, calling to each other
Maybe we were made eternities ago
And maybe we didn't know
Ooooohhh

[Chorus]
Stranger things had happened
How strange would it be
If I told you I believe you were made for me
Made for me yeah (made for me)
Oh made for me yeah (made for me)
Oh made for me yeah (made for me)
Made for me, made for me
Ain't it funny how strangers
Became less entangled
And ain't it funny I don't ever wanna let it go

[Bridge]
But maybe we are from a place
Where time and space won't end
Maybe
Maybe we came from the stars
Maybe an angel flung into my arms
Maybe baby

I've seen crazier days

[Chorus]
Stranger things had happened
How strange would it be
If I told you I believe you were made for me
Made for me yeah (made for me)
Oh made for me yeah (made for me)
Oh made for me yeah (made for me)
Made for me, made for me
Ain't it funny how strangers
Became less entangled
And ain't it funny I don't ever wanna let it go
Ain't love strange

[Outro]
Ooohhh ain't love strange
