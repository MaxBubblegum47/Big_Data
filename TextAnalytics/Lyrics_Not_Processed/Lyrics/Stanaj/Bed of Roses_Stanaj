[Verse 1: Stanaj]
I see the fear in your eyes
Can't find the feeling inside
You can run, you can try, living on your own
But I just can't let you go

[Pre-Chorus: Stanaj]
And I think that you might have been
In my heart all along
And I know that if this is real
Then how could it be wrong?

[Chorus: Stanaj]
Wanna make you my only
Let me heal what's broken
Lay your head down softly
In a bed of roses
You don't have to be lonely
Let me heal what's broken
Just lay your head on me
In a bed of roses

[Verse 2: Stanaj]
I'll be the fire inside
The one who's making you wild
And I know you're afraid it'll never last
'Cause it happens so fast

[Pre-Chorus: Stanaj]
And I think that you might have been
In my heart all along
And I know that if this is real
Then how could it be wrong?

[Chorus: Stanaj]
Wanna make you my only
Let me heal what's broken
Lay your head down softly
In a bed of roses
You don't have to be lonely
Let me heal what's broken
Just lay your head on me
In a bed of roses

[Outro: Stanaj]
Wanna make you my only
Let me heal you what's broken
Lay your head down softly
In a bed of roses
In a bed of roses
In a bed of roses
