[Intro]
You remind me
You remind me

[Verse 1]
I wouldn't say that I'm sorry
I wouldn't say that I would do it for someone else
I wouldn't say I apologize
You know me better than my flaws and from my mistakes
I could lie, yeah, you know I could
But I need you more now every day
And I try, yeah, you know I do
But nothing can compare to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Put your lovin' on me now, mama
I wanna love ya, love ya
Tell me what you wanna do, mama
I wanna love ya, love ya

[Chorus]
Oh, you remind me, you remind me
Remind me oh, of a long lost love (You remind me)
Oh, you remind me, you remind me
Remind me oh, of a long lost love (You remind me)
(You remind me) But you remind me, you remind me
Remind me oh, of a long lost love (You remind me)

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't say that I'm broken
'Cause when I close my eyes all I see is you
In every way you're the opposite
I feel your heart beat wherever I go
I could lie, yeah, you know I could
But I need you more now every day
And I try, yeah, you know I do
But nothing can compare
No, nothing can compare to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Put your lovin' on me now, mama
I wanna love ya, love ya
Tell me what you wanna do, mama
I wanna love ya, love ya

[Chorus]
Now you remind me, you remind me
Remind me oh, of a long lost love (You remind me)
Now you remind me, you remind me
Remind me oh, of a long lost love (You remind me)
(Woah, you remind me, woah, you remind me)

[Bridge]
Put your lovin' on me now, mama
I wanna love ya, love ya
Tell me what you wanna do, mama
I wanna love ya, love ya

[Chorus]
Oh, you remind me, you remind me
Remind me oh, of a long lost love (You remind me)
Oh, you remind me, you remind me
Remind me oh, of a long lost love (You remind me)
(You remind me)
