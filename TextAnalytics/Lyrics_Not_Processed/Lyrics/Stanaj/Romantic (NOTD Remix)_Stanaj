[Verse 1]
You say I make you shy
I don't know why
Every time we kiss
It gets better every time (Yeah)
Underneath the light
You're shining so bright
The tension in the air
You could cut it with a knife (Yeah)

[Pre Chorus]
See, I'm just tryna be somebody
You got me in love so deep
No, I don't got to do these things
But you make me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You make me wanna be a romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna act different
I love you for who you are
You make me want to run circles around you
So glad that I found you
You make me wanna be a romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna be a romantic
Make me wanna be a romantic, yeah

[Verse 2]
Have you got the time?
We could do dinner and wine
I could compliment you
But that would take all night (Yeah)

[Pre Chorus]
See, I'm just tryna be somebody
You got me in love so deep
No, I don't got to do these things
But you make me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You make me wanna be a romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna act different
I love you for who you are
You make me wanna run circles around you
So glad that I found you
You make me wanna be a romantic
You make me wanna be a star

[Chorus 2]
You make me wanna be a romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna be different
I love you for who you are
You make me wanna do circles around you
So glad I found you
I just wanna be a romantic
I just wanna be a star
You make me wanna be a romantic
Make me wanna be a romantic, yeah

[Bridge]
You make me wanna do things I never seem to do
Never said those three words
But I say 'em to you
You make me wanna say things I never seem to say
Make me ask, "Why am I always acting this way?"
You make me wanna do things I never seem to do
Never said those three words
But I say 'em to you
You make me wanna say things I never seem to say
You make me ask why the hell I'm
Acting this way

[Chorus]
You make me wanna be a romantic
You make me wanna be a star
You make me wanna act different
I love you for who you are
You make me want to run circles around you
So glad that I found you
You make me wanna be a romantic
You make me wanna be a star
