[Chorus: Stanaj]
And even when there's no more alcohol
I still think about you, baby
’Cause I never thought we'd be in love
Even when we're sober
Now it’s almost morning, I don't want this to be over
'Cause I never thought we'd be in love
Even when we're sober

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
My mind made up, fallin' is courageous
Pretty please, pray for us (Us, us)
Once you change up, I see you a traitor
Now I think you're dangerous (Oh)
Nobody said you had to live a boring life
No typical shit, we switchin' up the vibes
Nobody said you had to live a boring life (Hey)
I’m feeling you, I wish I could extend my night (Yeah)

[Chorus: Stanaj & 
Swae Lee
]
And even when there’s no more alcohol
I still think about you, baby
'Cause I never thought we’d be in love (
Ayy
)
Even when we're sober
Now it's almost morning, I don't want this to be over
’Cause I never thought we'd be in love
Even when we're sober

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Ayy, ayy
Last call for alcohol, screamin', "Fuck the law!"
Last time I got a taste, it wasn't enough at all
Body language say it all, stop tryna play it off
She got a bad attitude, I'm 'bout to break her off
She too eager to hop into my two-seater
When I asked about her man, she caught amnesia
Damn, I can't believe I'm sober in Ibiza
Damn, I'm drippin' and she like the way I clean up (Hey)
She like, "I need, I need, I need, I need ya," ayy
She like, "I need, I need, I need, I need ya"

[Chorus: Stanaj & 
Swae Lee
]
And even when there's no more alcohol
I still think about you, baby
'Cause I never thought we'd be in love (
Ayy
)
Even when we're sober
Now it's almost morning, I don't want this to be over
'Cause I never thought we'd be in love
Even when we're sober

[Bridge: Stanaj]
(Oh)
Go ahead now, do what you do
Well, I guess I got nothing to lose
I just wanna stay here with you

[Chorus: Stanaj & 
Swae Lee
]
And even when there's no more alcohol
I still think about you, baby
'Cause I never thought we'd be in love (
Ayy
)
Even when we're sober
Now it's almost morning, I don't want this to be over
'Cause I never thought we'd be in love
Even when we're sober
