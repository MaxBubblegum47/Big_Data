[Verse 1]
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she’s nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch, but she’s warm as a devil
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
She takes 'til I break and I can’t get more

[Chorus]
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change
No, I wouldn’t change this love
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change
No, I wouldn’t change this love
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me

[Verse 2]
Alone in the night ‘til she knocks on my door, oh no
Wasted again
, but I can’t say no, whoa

[Refrain]
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Gave you my heart, but you took my soul

[Chorus]
You got me in chains (Oh baby)
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change (I wouldn’t change)
No, I wouldn’t change this love
You got me chains
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change (I wouldn’t change)
No, I wouldn’t change this love
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me

[Refrain]
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Gave you my heart, but you took my soul

[Chorus]
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
I wouldn’t change
No, I wouldn’t change this love
You got me chains (Oh baby)
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change
I wouldn’t change this love
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me
