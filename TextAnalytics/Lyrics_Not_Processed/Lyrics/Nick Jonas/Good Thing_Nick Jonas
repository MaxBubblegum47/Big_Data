[Intro: Sage the Gemini & (Nick Jonas)]
(Ooh)
Yeah
Uh, and they already know me, S-A-G-E (Ooh)
Look

[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
They be speaking on what they don't know
They don't know because I keep it low
When I go low, she tell me where to go
I make her act up, when I come back up
She says her feelings too strong, make her wanna back up
And I respond like "damn"
Believe me when I tell you I agree
(Like damn) An hour later it was gon' be you or me
(Like damn) Now I don't wanna let you go
But there's something that you gotta know

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
This ain't nothing but dangerous
We about to be over it
Why can't it just be what it is?
Why can't it be what it is?
We’re both getting emotional
Same time getting so sexual
Why can’t it be what it is?
Why can’t it be what it is?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I know, you know, we know
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening
I know, you know, we know
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
I ain't never felt the way you make me feel
Continue so I know it's real
Think about me like I know you will
Fall for me, let it fall for me, give it all to me
Stand in the middle of the floor, throw your bra to me
This is real, yeah, this is real, let your guard down
This is good shit, ain't no time to call it off now
(Like damn) Now I don't wanna let you go, but there's something that you gotta know

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Sage the Gemini)]
This ain't nothing but dangerous
We about to be over it
Why can't it just be what it is?
Why can't it be what it is?
We’re both getting emotional
Same time getting so sexual
Why can’t it be what it is?
Why can’t it be what it is?
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Sage the Gemini)]
I know, you know, we know
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening
I know, you know, we know
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening, yeah
No, no, no, no
(I don't wanna let you go, I-I don't wanna let you go)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
We’re both getting emotional
Same time getting so sexual
Why can’t it be what it is?
Why can’t it be what it is?
Yeah, ahh

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I know, you know, we know
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening
I know, you know, we know
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening
We can make the good shit keep happening
Good shit keep happening
