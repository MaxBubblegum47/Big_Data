[Verse 1]
Tell me, where did we go wrong?
We should be singing Christmas songs
Instead of shouting all night long like we do
We keep fighting in the street
When we should be home wrapped in the sheets
Putting presents underneath the tree for me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we had our fair share
Of breaking up, and making up
I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up, no

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll be together
Baby, all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Verse 2]
It hasn't been the greatest year
But through thick and thin we made it here
Just keep holding onto me, and I'll hold you
But we made it through the hardest part
And I followed you, the brightest star
I just wanna be where you are, right where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we've had our fair share
Of breaking up, yeah, and making up
But I promise you we'll get there
So don't give up, no, don't

[Chorus]
If we can make it through December
Maybe we'll make it through forever
'Cause all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this
If we can make it through December
Every New Year we'll have together
Baby, all I want for Christmas
Is you and me to fix this

[Bridge]
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah
A-a-all I want, yeah

[Outro]
If we can make it through December (A-a-all I want, yeah)
Every New Year we'll be together (A-a-all I want, yeah)
'Cause all I want for Christmas (A-a-all I want, yeah)
Is you and me to fix this (A-a)
