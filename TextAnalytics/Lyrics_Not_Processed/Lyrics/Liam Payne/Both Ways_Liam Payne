[Intro]
My girl, she like it both ways
She like the way it all taste
Couple more, we'll call it foreplay
No, no, I don't discriminate
Bring it back to my place
Yeah, she like it both ways

[Verse 1]
Girl, I can feel it, oh yeah, I can feel what you want, yeah
Like that you're different, yeah, do what you want
I won't judge, I won't judge

[Refrain]
Lovin' the way that she's turning you on
Switching the lanes like a Bugatti Sport
Nothing but luck that she got me involved, yeah
Flipping that body, go head, I go tails
Sharing that body like it's our last meal
One and a two and a three, that's for real

[Pre-Chorus]
She said we're young and we're stupid
She said, "Come on, boy, let's do this"
Make every day my birthday
Let's celebrate, like oh my gosh
She do things you won't believe

[Chorus]
My girl, she like it both ways
She like the way it all taste
Couple more, we'll call it foreplay
No, no, I don't discriminate
Bring it back to my place
Yeah, she like it both ways (Both ways)
Both ways, both ways (Both ways)

[Verse 2]
Four in the morning
Yeah, who else you wanna invite?
Never too many hands all on your body
And mine, you're all mine

[Refrain]
Lovin' the way that she's turning you on
Switching the lanes like a Bugatti Sport
Nothing but luck that she got me involved, yeah
Flipping that body, go head, I go tails
Sharing that body like it's our last meal
One and a two and a three, that's for real

[Pre-Chorus]
She said we're young (We're young) and we're stupid
She said, "Come on, watch me while we do this"
Make every day my birthday
Let's celebrate, like oh my gosh
She do things you won't believe

[Chorus]
My girl, she like it both ways (Both ways)
She like the way it all taste (The way it all taste)
Couple more, we'll call it foreplay
No, no, I don't discriminate
Bring it back to my place
Yeah, she like it both ways (Both ways)
Both ways, both ways (Both ways)

[Bridge]
Make every day my birthday
Let's celebrate, like oh my gosh
She do things you won't believe

[Chorus]
My girl, she like it both ways (Both ways)
She like the way it all taste (She like the way it all taste)
Couple more, we'll call it foreplay
No, no, I don't discriminate
Bring it back to my place
Yeah, she like it both ways (Both ways)
Both ways, both ways
(Said bring it back to my place, yeah, she like it both ways)
(Both ways)
Both ways, both ways
(I said bring it back to my place, yeah, she like it both ways)

[Outro]
Both ways, both ways
