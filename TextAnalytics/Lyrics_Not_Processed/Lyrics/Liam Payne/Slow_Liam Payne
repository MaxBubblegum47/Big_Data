[Verse 1]
Though this is done, I will turn a blind eye
Don't tell me goodnight, cause' it means goodbye
Know, that we're broken
Know, this was over months ago, months ago

[Pre-Chorus]
Got me pretendin' you ain't done with us
It got me runnin' round the obvious
Yeah, baby, why you gotta rush?

[Chorus]
If you’re gonna let me down, let me down slow
Tell me what I already, already know
I know that your mind's already made up
But gimme one more night now before we give up
If you’re gonna let me down, let me down slow
Just another minute, I ain't ready to go
Before we let the light in, baby, just hold me like you don't know
That you're gonna let me down, let me down slow

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Let's leave it unsaid, just one more second
If you don't say it, then it ain't true yet
Know, that we're broken
Know, this was over months ago, months ago

[Pre-Chorus]
Got me pretendin' you ain't done with us
It got me runnin' round the obvious
Yeah, baby, why you gotta rush

[Chorus]
If you’re gonna let me down, let me down slow
Tell me what I already, already know
I know that your mind's already made up
But gimme one more night now before we give up
If you’re gonna let me down, let me down slow
Just another minute, I ain't ready to go
Before we let the light in, baby, just hold me like you don't know
That you're gonna let me down, let me down, slow

[Post-Chorus]
Let me down, let me down slow

[Bridge]
So let me down, let me down slow
Why you gotta rush, when I already know
That your mind's already made up
And I know you wanna give up
So before you let me down, let me down slow
Give it one more minute, 'cause I don't wanna go
Before we let the light in, baby, just hold me like you don't know
That you're gonna let me down, let me down, let me down, let me down slow

[Post-Chorus]
Let me down, let me down slow, yeah
Let me down, let me down slow
