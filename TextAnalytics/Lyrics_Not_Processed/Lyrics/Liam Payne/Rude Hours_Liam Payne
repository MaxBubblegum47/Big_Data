[Verse 1]
Meet me in the parking lot
Yeah, might be a bad idea, I prob'ly do your ass in the car
You'll say, “Quit being naughty”
Oh, that’s what your body always does to me (Ooh)
Check in at the Hard Rock Hotel, baby
It's not too far from here

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't run the lights unless you're close behind
Really want to get there, let's be safe tonight
'Cause we both been drinking
Key unlocks the door, take you on the floor
Always back for more, think I'll be ready for

[Chorus]
Sweat drippin' down your back
You've been here on top of me, feel crazy 'bout you
(Crazy about you, messed up about you, ooh)
I bet we forget
Everything else, it won't exist for hours
Hours, hours, hours, hours

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh-oh
Hours, hours, hours, hours

[Verse 2]
See, what I like about you is you know how to take direction
Don't wanna let it go too fast, let's save the best for last
The way you throwin' it back, yeah, I love it, love it like that
Mama, little mama, yeah, you hold on tight
You gon' make me book another night
Let's keep this between us, won't tell, baby
'Cause it ain't none of they business, baby, I know you with it

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't run the lights unless you're close behind
Really want to get there, let's be safe tonight
'Cause we both been drinking
Key unlocks the door, take you on the floor
Always back for more, think I'll be ready for

[Chorus]
Sweat drippin' down your back
You've been here on top of me, feel crazy 'bout you
(Crazy about you, messed up about you, ooh)
I bet we forget
Everything else, it won't exist for hours
Hours, hours, hours, hours

[Bridge]
Sexy ass dress, leave it on, babe
Another level with the foreplay
You know how to take instructions
Take it any way you want, babe
And that's real, I'm 'bout to lay it down
Take you out 'bove the clouds, don't come down
We gon' be here for hours, hours, hours, hours

[Chorus]
Sweat drippin' down your back
You've been here on top of me, feel crazy 'bout you
(Crazy about you, messed up about you, ooh)
I bet we forget
Everything else, it won't exist for hours
Hours, hours, hours, hours
Hours, hours, hours, hours
