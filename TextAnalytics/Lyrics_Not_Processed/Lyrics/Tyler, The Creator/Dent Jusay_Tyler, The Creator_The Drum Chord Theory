Dent Jusay you wanna fly away someday?
So won't you roll with me then?

[Verse 1: Syd]
Why you keep flexin' on me
Like I'm just anybody
The view from here's a sight to see
You don't know what your missing
You might lose my attention
Darling our flight's about to leave

[Verse 2: Steve Lacy]
So you say you wanna fly?
But you say no, you're scared of heights
He don't keep you satisfied
But I'll be here when you decide (ohhhh)

[Hook]
Dent jusay you wanna fly away someday
So won't you roll with me then
Dent jusay you wanna fly away someday
So won't you roll with me then
Dent jusay
Dent jusay
Dent jusay
Dent jusay

...Sneaking it into my titties but then I don't know—
Don't
If one of those kind of shows where people be smoking in the crowds
Dang, you know—do-don't sneak the weed into your titties bro, like we'll be there in a second just put it- you can smoke with us too-just put it one of our like instrument cases and you'll be straight
So don't leave it in the car? 'Cause we said we walking right now to go to the place
I mean you could leave it in the car 'cause we don't perform until midnight so we can always go back and get it
And I got a blunt now rolled up—yeah we already got a blunt anyway—yeah we got hella weed too so and you got all access so you can like some back-in the back with us
Alright, we here-we just parked, we just gonna walk in
Alright shawty
