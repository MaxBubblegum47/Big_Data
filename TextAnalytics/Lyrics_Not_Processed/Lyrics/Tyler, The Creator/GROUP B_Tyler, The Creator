[Intro]
That's all I wanna do
Ayy, yo

[Verse 1]
Bucket hat like I'm Gilligan
Hit Wallace, I just ordered a Cullinan
Milkin' the cow, what are you niggas uttering?
Churning the butter, sensitive niggas crying
Stepping in puddles in them new (Giannos, nigga, come on)
The team I'm assembling, you trembling
We in a circle huddling, fumble and we coming in
Tackling your empire, it's Robert crumbling
One nom'? Huh, shit is humbling
I'm a fucking jumbotron, juggernaut
You a G? No, you're not
New balloon, watch it p-
Concave on a skateboard
Don't do surfboards, I don't ride waves
Been around forever, Murray's Pomade, nigga
Been like a decade, yeah, haha, uh, ayy, yo

[Verse 2]
Keep it buck, I switch it up
You niggas don't, that's why you stuck
I needed seven figures, hit Australia, pick it up
Find some young twink and get my nipples sucked
Bad yellow bitch look like pimple pus
Bad chocolate bitch look like Lionel knuckles
Y'all got too much baggage and I pack light, Louis trunk
Luggage double C, emeralds double V
Uni tee, but the sweater vest is me
Lemonade, elderflower with the rose
Sony re'd up, I'ma split it with the bro, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Niggas like, "Act your age, T, you trippin'"
Pushin' thirty, but the skin say different, well
If I act my last deal, I'm probably twelve
I put some niggas on, nigga set a lob
Then they hurt theyself, niggas Cheddar Bob (Pew, pew, pew)
Foot is on the gas, I ain't letting off (Skrrt)
Every car is gas, pissing Greta off
And they Group B and the leather soft
And I knew the cow, and he better off dead

[Outro]
One take
It's like 7 a.m., haha
