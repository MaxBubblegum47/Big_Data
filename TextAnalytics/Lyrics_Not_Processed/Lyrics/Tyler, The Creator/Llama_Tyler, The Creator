Lyrics from snippets

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
My mom caught me jackin' off to Hanna Montana with a banana peel
Sippin' a Cherry Fanta to match my dress and my purple heels
Lookin' like Santa, but skinny in a black weave, it's real
In a stolen truck with a license to kill
I tell em' I'm Frank from Montana, the king of the hill
Except I'm a n****r from the Junkyard Gang
Bill Cosby couldn't spot me if I copied a duck and a bill
Simply 'cause I do not give a fuck like virginity
Illmatic with the tactics
I don't give a fuck how you feel, I got Wolf
I flow backwards like heat when it chills on a thermometer
I skatin', rappin', composin' photographer is back like a black bitch's hair line kilometer
Hotter than Madonna, "Doo Doo Mama" back up dancers
With the windows rolled up inside the Honda
Drivin' through Nеvada in the summer
Tyler, comma, Thе Creator is a fuckin' animal
In such, I'm spittin' like a llama, n***a
I'm a bastard, I'm a walrus, I'm a mothafuckin' llama, n***a
