[Verse 1]
I'm Ace, what's your name? (Britney)
Oh that's nice, do you wanna hang out some time
That time on the clock, we could either go to Rosco's or Wingstop
Unless, you wanna see a flick, my homie work at pacific
That means I could get a ticket for a couple six bucks
But that's priceless compared to getting my dick sucked girl
I'm just playing, I'm not really hanging out with you for laying
I'm tryna mold a relationship I'm claying
So I can hear your thoughts and see what your saying
Favorite color, AP Government,
 this conversation I'm loving it
We can talk about your favorite music, talk about politics
I got an open mind I'm into all type of shit

[Hook]
I just wanna be your friend girl (you're so respectful Tyler)
I just wanna be your friend girl (we could be friends)
We could go to the movies, you don't gotta kiss me
I could pull my pants down, you don't gotta lick me
Even if we go to the bathroom, I'll help you, we don't have to getta quickie
We could have study groups, girl just hang with me
(Best friends) yeah, (forever)

[Verse 2]
Look bitch (yeah) I'm not here to conversate, and listen to all your feelings, aight?
I got things to do, my daughter hungry, bills to pay, and games to watch (what are you talking about?)
I don't feel like listening to your feelings and how you feel and your favourite colour and all that (*gasp*)
If I can't put nothing in you, I shouldn't put no time in you (*gasp*), you understand what I'm saying? (no!)
Holla at your boy, here's a lesson to all men (what are you talking about?)
Yo, if she trying to stay in that friend zone, zone her ass to her friends (gasp!)
(I cannot believe you) N-no, don't give me that, don't give me that
Bitch, roll up
(Aww, I thought you were different)
