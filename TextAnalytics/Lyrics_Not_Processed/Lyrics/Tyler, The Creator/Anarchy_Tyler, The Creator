[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I am sinful sentiment
Criminal Demon sent
The fuck your rumor lifestyle
What is your profile?
Bet it ain't zero to one eighty in two point five
I'm in a five point five
With my three five seven
Five bitches in the back listen to my voice like reverend
I drop them off in a parking lot
They run to their civic chevron
More meddling to the peddling
Going home to her hesband (hesband? FUCK YOUR HUSBAND BITCH)
Nigga I break your Mac-zilla to the max-i-mum
Blondy va-cuums cum, sucks like drac-u-la
Dirt De vil Cruella,
 white chocolate vanilla
Polka dotted spotted wallet interior croc-a-della
I'm cultivated face it smiles motivated braces
Start with your clothes and make up
Lashes rings and bracelets
Our strippers so naked
American Apparel spandex
Blows like a air conditioner
I'll make her a fan next
O.F. shows six tickets to row six
She catch six I throw six
She stretch dicks aerobics a blow fish
I know this, this ho-bitch
I sold tits to old rich motherfucks who she gold-digs (GIMME THAT GOLD!)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Guns n Roses!
 Fucking Posers!
Nigga keep spittin' that snotty noses
Keep preaching that hocus pocus
I keep three sixes cause the shit is bogus
Boloney, malarkey, 
hutch and starsky
Shit is gettin' fishy wit' a box of sardines
Now I gotta eat them like shark and the shit is
Getting harder than a concretes dick
O.F. Sergent
Cleaner than a virgin tryin' to fuck de-tar-gent
Thats a bargain
Wolf gang wolf gang cats is barking
Try calling the bounce
Nigga guns is sparking!
Light is darkened end is starting
The car of giving a fuck is parking
Feel that heart beat n' get that car key
And drive the motherfucker into that anarchy!!
Start that car
Drive to nowhere and nowhere's far
And when you get there say hi to the dead kids walking
GO!
