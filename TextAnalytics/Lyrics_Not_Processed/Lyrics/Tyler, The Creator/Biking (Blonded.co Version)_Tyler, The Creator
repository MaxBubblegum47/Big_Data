[Verse 1]
From Coldwater to the Shaw
Alcoholic way I handle the bars
This a PK, PK Ripper
Nah, you can't fuck with the boy
That’s my problem, yeah, I got 'em
My tire smokin' when I stop
Okay, nobody fuckin’ with me
My accolades hang from my neck
Pedal, I drown in the heat
My sapphires drown in my sweat
White mags, but I jet
Jackson, I'm savin' the streets
I'm Roger Rabbit in the air
I don't care, Big Willie Style, yeah
Nigga one wheel, one wheel, one wheel
Nigga one wheel, I fishtail downhill, yeah
I rose my rate, brand new brakes
Why I name it Slater? Ask my date

[Outro]
I got rockets on the back
Of my BMX bike
And my heart does wheelies when the
Light hits your pale skin
