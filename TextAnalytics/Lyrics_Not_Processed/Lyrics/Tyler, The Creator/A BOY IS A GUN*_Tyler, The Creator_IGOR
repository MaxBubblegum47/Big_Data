No, don't shoot me down (Okay)
No, don't shoot me down

[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
(You started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
'Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck
We show 'em no respect

[Post-Chorus]
(You started with a mere hello)
When the time's right, yeah
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (A boy is a gun)
(Turn me up a little bit)

[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down

[Verse 1]
Take your hoodie off, why you hide your face from me?
Make your fuckin' mind up, I am sick of waitin' patiently
How come you're the best to me? I know you're the worst for me
Boy, you're sweet as sugar, diabetic to the first degree
My spidey sensies got me on the fencies
Whole squad in Ginza, travel bag by Balenci'
Big dawg hittin' big wheelies on the six speed

[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down

[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
(You started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
'Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck
They show 'em no respect

[Post-Chorus]
(You started with a mere hello)
When the time's right (Yeah)
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (A boy is a gun)
(Look)
No, don't shoot me down

[Verse 2]
Oh, you passive-aggressive? Oh, you fakin' you're mad?
(You started with a mere hello)
Oh, you wanna go home? Cool, you better call you a cab
I ain't takin' you home, yeah, I'm brushin' you off
'Cause this parka is Comme, you're my favorite gar√ßon
Don't leave, stay right here, yeah, I want you right near
(You started with a mere hello)
You invited me to breakfast, why the fuck your ex here?
Well, let's see if you 'round a god around this time next year

[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down

No, don't shoot me down
No, don't shoot me down

[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
(You started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why I start to think it's lame as fuck
(Well, I'm here for you)

[Post-Chorus]

When the time's right (Yeah)
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (A boy is a gun)

[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down

You're a gun 'cause I like you on my side at all times
You keep me safe  (No, don't shoot me down)
(You started with a mere hello)
Wait, wait, depending on, you know (All the time)
You could be dangerous to me (Time, time)
Or anyone else

[Verse 3]
Look, they be bringin' us up
(You started with a mere hello)
Yeah, like now and again
Give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout, I see you as a 10
I'ma leave it at that, I'ma leave us as friends
'Cause the irony is I don't wanna see you again
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
I ain't gon' repeat myself, but stay the fuck away from me

[Outro]
(You started with a mere hello)
(A boy is a gun)
No, don't shoot me down
(You started with a mere hello)
(A boy is a gun)
