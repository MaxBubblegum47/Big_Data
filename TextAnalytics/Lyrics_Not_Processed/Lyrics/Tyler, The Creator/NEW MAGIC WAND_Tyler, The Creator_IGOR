[Intro: Jerrod Carmichael]
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Nigga)
New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & 
Santigold & Jessy Wilson
]
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (
Don't leave
)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (
Don't leave
)
Please don't leave me now (
Don't leave
)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
Please don't leave me now (
Don't leave
)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & 
Santigold & Jessy Wilson
]
I wanna be found, passenger in your car (
Don't leave
)
You wanna be mean, mixed signals, don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (
Don't leave
)
We can finally be together

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain'tâ€“
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned
New magic wand
