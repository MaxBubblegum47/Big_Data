Part 1 - FUCKING YOUNG

[Intro]
Day that I met you, girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck, I can't sing, whatever, look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion began
'Cause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't

[Pre-Chorus]
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, "I don't know"? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, 'cause

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & 
Tyler, The Creator
]
'Cause girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (
For me
)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love

[Verse 1]
A six-year (Difference)
Is a ten year (Sentence)
And with the (Pigment) on my skin
I don't want to be another (Statistic)
You bring me (Joy, joy, joy, joy)
And you fill a void that was once missing
And (I can say I'm in love)

[Pre-Chorus]
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, "I don't know"? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, 'cause

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & 
Tyler, The Creator
]
'Cause girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (
For me
)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love

[Verse 2]
When you're 35, I'll be 41, and when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb, and when that time comes for that 1-8
I'll probably run, 'cause I'm fucking terrified
Yo this is dumb,
 you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention "hang," I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck

[Outro]
(But you're too fucking young)
I really like you
I don't know what to do
(And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
Funny thing about this is
By the time you hear this
It won't even matter
I'll be in the clear
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young
Part 2 - PERFECT

[Intro: Kali Uchis]
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)

[Verse 1: Kali Uchis & 
Tyler, The Creator
]
I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I’ll exit and wait a while
Just say the word girl
Can't you see the answers are all there
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
But you're too fuckin' young
And girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin’ hurts
Fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one
That you're the one, for me
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me, yeah

[Outro]
I rock (I rock)
I rock (I rock)
I rock (I rock)
