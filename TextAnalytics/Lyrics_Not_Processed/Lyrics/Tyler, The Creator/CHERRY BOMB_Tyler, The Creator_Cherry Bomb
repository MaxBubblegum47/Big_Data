[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
I really made this song just so I could perform it
I don't even know what it mean
It means something

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Aw, nah, boy don't cut that wood
Found out your flowers don't smell that good?
But if they smell real good to him
Then he don't need nobody else nose to win
Look, I am a God, nobody prays to the sight of you
All y'all niggas wear camouflage
I'm in a field wearing pink and blue
I wear pink, they can see me
Nigga, you don’t create, you just repeat
Nigga, you don’t got drive, you just beep beep
Beep beep, talk shit from the backseat

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Come and light my fire
I'll blow your fucking face off
Nigga, I'm the goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tie the knot (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Kick the chair (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Float in the air (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's cherry bomb

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
You motherfuckers want war? Then come get it
You motherfuckers don't really want it
You motherfuckers want war and I want more
Nigga, fuck you and everything that you come for
You motherfuckers wanna blow?
Pow, pow-pow, pow-pow
Then let’s take ‘em to the gun store
I don't got enough time, fuck your Rolex, nigga
Don’t compare him to mine, ‘cause I don’t know that, nigga

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Come and light my fire, I'll blow your fucking face off
Nigga, I'm the goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tie the knot (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Kick the chair (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Float in the air (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's cherry bomb

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You motherfuckers want war?
Fuck that, light this, that cherry bomb
Fuck that, light this, that cherry bomb
Fuck that, light this, that cherry bomb
Fuck that, light this, that cherry bomb
Fuck that, light this, that cherry bomb
Fuck that, light this, that cherry bomb
Fuck that, light this, that cherry bomb
Fuck that, light this, that cherry bomb
Fuck that, light this, that cherry bomb
Fuck that, light this, that cherry bomb
Fuck that, light this, that cherry bomb
Fuck that, light this, that cherry—

[Refrain: Syd, Tyler, The Creator, Both]
Firecracker and I’m ready to blow
Don’t fire me up, I lose control (I lose control)
Firecracker and I’m ready to blow
Don’t fire me up, I lose control (I lose control)
Firecracker and I’m ready to blow
Don’t fire me up, I lose control (I lose control)
Firecracker and I’m ready to blow
Don’t fire me up, I lose control (I lose control)
Firecracker and I’m ready to blow
Don’t fire me up, I lose control (I lose control)
Don't fire me up, I lose control (I lose control)
I'm ready to blow, don't fire me up (I lose control)
Don't fire me up, I lose control (I lose control)
Firecracker, firecracker, firecracker (I lose control)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I lose co—)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
