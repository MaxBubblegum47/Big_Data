[Verse 1]
Been that man since Batman had a sidekick
Robin, and I'm giving to the poor Mike Tyson
Don't drink extavia bitch I put rice in
Here bitch, ziploc bag filled with my dick
Give it to your parents and tell them that it's a nice gift
Of my semen, futures as I'm a psychic
Do you wanna ride? Because I don't know where my bike is
I've lost my mind
Can somebody page Amanda Bynes and maybe she can help me find it?
Pink and blue all on my neck, fuck I'm blinded
I'm a nigga bitch, bring that pink pale pussy here and take some nigga dick
Spitting, get it cracking like some nigga lips
Bad to the bone, I don't know where my appendix is
I'm kidding it's right here
In the pocket of them pants covered in white smears
Engine to my left, 
Clipse plays in my right ear
When I steer that third gear, people fear when I drive here
I'm fast motherfucker in a whole other lightyear, what's up?

[Outro]
Yo, that flow is sick
(Yeah)
I'm going to figure out how to do some shit
