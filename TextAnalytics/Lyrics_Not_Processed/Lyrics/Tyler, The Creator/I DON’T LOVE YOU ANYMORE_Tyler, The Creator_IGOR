[Verse 1]
See, um, heavy feelings for you, yeah, yeah, it's no secret
You too cool for me and I ain't tryna freeze up
Like the Johnsons, nonsense, I would speak up
And realize there's more fish in the sea, I'ma re-up
Like, bitch, I know my shit is bumping, it's eczema
So I won't walk around with my head down like I got beat up
Um, you do you, I'll do me, Iâ€™ll just chuck the peace up
I ain't tryna keep up, because

[Chorus]
I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
But this just might be better for us, you know?

[Bridge]
('Cause I don't love like I used to)
Where did time go, I need location
('Cause you don't wanna talk about it, baby)
That's all that I know, I, I, I, I
Where did time go?

[Verse 2]
But now, movin' on, but how?
Uh, somethin' put my feelings in the lost and found
Now I'm stuck forever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever
Forever, and ever, and ever
I don't love you no more
Tell me where to go
Can I have my heart back? (Heart back)

[Chorus]
I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore (You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore
But this just might be better for us, you kn-
