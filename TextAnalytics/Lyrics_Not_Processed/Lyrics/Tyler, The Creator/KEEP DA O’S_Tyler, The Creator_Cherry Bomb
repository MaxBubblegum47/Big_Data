[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the O's
Keep the O's, nigga keep the O's
Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
Keep the O's, (nigga) keep the O's
Know they know me by "Treat Your Nose"

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Look, UFO, bow, land
Skrr landed on the ass and
Adidas leaf in the grassland
My finger got a yellow Pac-Man
Blow your purple, go in circles, so inertia
Go reverse it, no rehearsin', gold is perfect
Open curtain, flow inversion, golden person
Yeah I'm nerdy, yeah I'm swerving
Yeah you heard me

[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the O's
Keep the O's, nigga keep the O's
Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
Keep the O's, (nigga) keep the O's
Know they know me by "Treat Your Nose"
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the O's
Keep the O's, nigga keep the O's
Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
Keep the O's, (nigga) keep the O's
Know they know me by "Treat Your Nose"

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Your garden is full from raking these hoes
A handful of green and a couple of stones
Your lawn mower's foreign, you rent you a home
But nigga, how much of that shit do you own?
See me, I don't compromise
I know my accomplishments
Fuck all yo compliments
Bitch, I got confidence
I don't need your approval, my nigga you suck
I do not have to adjust to stunt
Don't talk don't jump don't cheer bitch shut the fuck up
You're speedin' and gleamin' and stuntin' so Evel Knievel
You beaming and circle in Bimmers you hoping them niggasâ€™ll see it
Results may vary, my chain, it's not too heavy
I'll rather pedal smooth on my bike than to crash in that Bugatti
But back to the garden, Niggas gone do you dirty
Already started, killing your flowers
It seems impossible, it's the new slave apocalypse, so sad and obvious that
All y'all stupid niggas got the whips and no drive

[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the O's
Keep the O's
Keep the O's
Keep the O's
You gotta keep the O's
Keep the O's
Keep the O's
Keep the O's
You gotta keep the O's

[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator]
Keep the O's
You gotta keep the O's (Keep the O's)
Cause you never know when it's over
You want the doors that go up
You want the girls with the big butts
You want the diamonds, you want the stones
You gotta stunt on these niggas
Stunt on these niggas one time
Find your wings
Find your wings
Find your wings
And fly
Cause you'll find your wings
You'll find your wings
Learn how to fly (learn)
Let me tell you what I want you to do
What I want you to do
You'll find your wings
You'll find your wings
Learn how to fly
(Learn)
Keep the O's

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm rapping about diamonds, and cars, and money now
What the fuck has gotten into me, man
