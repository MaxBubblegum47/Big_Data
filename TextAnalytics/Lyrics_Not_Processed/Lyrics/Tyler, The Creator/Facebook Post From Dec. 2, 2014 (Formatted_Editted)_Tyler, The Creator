All of you negative motherfuckers should look to me as inspiration. I'm 23 fucking years old and I built a fucking monster and I'm not ever gonna fucking land. Stop being scared and negative. Start believing in yourself and stop living for all these other fucking idiots. Some of y'all should put that fucking blunt down and go do what the fuck you know you need to do. Do it for yourself. I believe in everyone because I believe in myself. Fuck reaching for the stars, that's setting a limit. Fuck those. Some of you don't like yourself. Some of you aren't comfortable with yourself. That's so fucking sad. Stop that shit. Some of you can't. That's why y'all ask for likes on Instagram and shit, because y'all's self esteem is so fucking low. Cut that shit out and start liking yourself. When that happens, you will start trusting yourself, then you trust your ideas, then you fucking become that person you really want to be. If you don't have any confidence, let me be your fucking confidence
I'm gonna be a fucking great years from now and I fully believe that and fully do not care about anyone's opinion on why I'm not because I know. Start smiling more and start hanging around people that makes you feel good or make you want to be better. Stop associating with losers. If a nigga only hits you up to smoke or drink or turn up and have nothing else to offer to get you where ever you think about being when you are alone daydreaming, then get the fuck away from them. Time is going by so fast and before you know it, you're gonna be on your deathbed telling stories about how much you sucked and how you regret not living the life you wanted to live, loving the people you wanted to love, taking the chances you wanted to take. THERE ARE NO RULES. FUCK THE RULES. GO. FIND YOUR WINGS. I FOUND MY WINGS AND I'M STILL FLYING AND I WILL NEVER EVER LAND. Some of you have to find yourself. I knew who I was at like age 10. I knew the music, I loved the colors, and I knew what I was into. Most of you listen to what ever is hot or what your friends like, y'all dress how everyone else dresses, y'all do what everyone else does. FUCKING STOP BEING A FUCKING FOLLOWER. Read the comments, the weak ass follower that will never make a difference ever because they fucking suck are gonna say some shit like "easier said than done" or "you are a hypocrite" or "you changed" or some stupid shit like that, because they are the weak fucks that I'm talking about and they can't cope with it, cause they are scared. DON'T BE SCARED
I don't know why I'm typing this. I'm on a lake on vacation just drawing and listening to music (I've been playing CC The World for like 6 hours) and I just realized, "Oh wow! I'm on a vacation for no reason, this is crazy. I've dreamed of this. How did I get this far? Oh yeah, by trusting myself and not following the path that my mom wanted me to go, and by surrounding myself with other people that wanted more out of life and trusted my wild ideas, and I put my art out there and people liked it and trusted me, and now I'm here. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want everyone to win. I want everyone to smile. I want everyone to be in a good mood and annoying and always jumping around like me cause I'm so fucking happy and grateful, but I realize niggas is scared. Or who knows, maybe I'm just a special one. I don't know anything. I'm in the woods and I really want to meet a moose in person. If I see one I'm gonna get a photo. Hahahahahaha. Oh, and RACISM IS FUCKING WEAK AS FUCK ANTI GOLF BOYS. This saturday, there will be another fall/winter drop from GOLF. Love you. Today, I want you to find your wings
