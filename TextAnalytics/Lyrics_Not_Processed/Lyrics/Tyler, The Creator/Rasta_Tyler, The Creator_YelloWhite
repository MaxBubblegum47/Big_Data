[Intro]
Yeah, welcome to the show
I hope you like us and if you don't, fuck you

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Black rasta band, fitted caps, no dreads
Look into the crowd, I see soldout heads
Tyler hit the drums while I pump up the fans
Left Brain with his shirt off jumping in the stands
Everybody hyped up and waving they hands
Spotlight so bright man, we all gon' have tans
Take this purchase like grams, Odd Future goes harder
Than sliced Thanksgiving honey roasted ham
Getting butter to the jam, so jam
Start in the PM, and end in the AM
I spit Stride flows, getting hit by the ram
I patrol control, so a fucking controller
These niggas crying, put 'em in a stroller
I stroll up in the fucking Range Rover
Red Rover, green Rover and I'm finna run you over

[Interlude]
Today's Friday, what do you do on Friday? Get high
You could hang with some friends, get some people, get together
You buy some tickets, you gon' see a great fucking show
Ace, Hodgy Beats, Left Brain, bitch!
Welcome to the show! Welcome to the show, bitch!
I hope you like us! You should love us actually, we work hard
Now, I'm gon' introduce you to the man on the drums
Ace the Fucking Creator, bitch!

[Verse 2: Ace aka Tyler the Creator]
Roll up a dutchie, I don't smoke weed, I do coke
But I guess that's why the white girls wanna fuck me
Man this bitch musty, man that nigga lucky
I bout to get his bitch, and get that bitch to come and touch me
Bob Marley blaring, it's hot as fuck, sweaty
My skinny ass flexing, so that fat bitches is sexing
My nigga Brain Leftin', O-high like Cleveland
Niggas in the evening, chilling like a villain in December
Drunk as fuck so I can't remember a thing
I'm 'bout to fall, timber
Odd Future rasta, I'm a fucking monster
Lochness, throw me in the beach (Comprende)
Man I got this bitch and her yeast on my tongue
Hopefully she cum.. fuck, drunk off this rum
And she from the home of the fucking Middle East
So her pussy bomb, peace
