[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Bitches think I'm crazy, but I'm normal
I just come off as a psycho maniac when I'm performin'
That's an act so I won't bore you to death, 'cause I adore you
And it's the summer, so (Yeah)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room? (Yeah)
Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
You can bring your bitches, I'ma bring my niggars
You can practice liking I, I'ma practice that guitar, baby
It's summer camp, Golf Wang, where the talking trees are (Shit)
You and your girls can roll, if you (Yeah)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room?

If you meet me by the pier, bring the peer, we can menage
Ooh, your girlfriend Nicki gots the back I like to massage (Yeah)

Lovesick, where’s the clinic aid?
We’re young, fun is what we’re having
Fuck it, pour a glass of lemonade
It’s snowcone and pop tarts I got and I got you (Snowcones, pop tarts)
Let me take a dip and you can take a break
That’s only if you meet me by the lake (Yeah)

So, come along
Just me and you, and like, nature
Bring a life jacket
'Cause you're gonna need it
So go ahead, take a dip
The water's pretty deep
