[Intro: Kali Uchis]
Boy, I know
That we could be more
Than just friends
But you're scared
Boy, I know
That we could be more
Than just friends
But you're scared

[Verse 1: Kali Uchis (Tyler the Creator)]
I know that there could be
Something for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
Oh darlin', it's in the way you want me
(Just say the word, girl)
You can see the answers are all there
(But I'm just too blind to see)
You and I are cut from different fabric
(I wonder why, I wonder why with you, girl)
Don't be too material to see
(But I'm just too blind to see)
Some how this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck em' all, baby, it's just you and me

[Pre-Hook: Tyler, Kali & Austin]
You make me better
And I know this don't make sense
But you make me better

[Hook: Austin Feinstein]
Alone, alone, alone
Ah-lone
Alone, at home, alone
Yeah, oh
Alone
Ah-lone
Lone
(Oo-oh)
