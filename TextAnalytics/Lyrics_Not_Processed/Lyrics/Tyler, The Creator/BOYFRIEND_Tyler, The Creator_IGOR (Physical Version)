[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & Charlie Wilson]
Compliments to smiles, or light to sun
This feels natural, no substitute, not one
Can't buy you the world, but my time is yours
Let you roll the dice, but I made my choice
Da na na na na duh duh, na, da na na na duh duh
Da na na na na duh duh, na
Guessin', don't be guessin' (I just want you to know)
Guessin', don't be guessin' (You're so special)
Guessin', don't be guessin'

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Baby, you gotta, you gotta understand (Oh)
Ain't no time (Uh), to play these games
You hear me? (Uh)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Hey, hey, aw, this shit is money now
Say, say, aw, my heart is pumping now (Uh)
Hey, hey, aw, we're getting funky, fuck what they
Say, say, aw, we should be together, baby
Never again, never again (Uh)
I'm tryna be more than a friend, my heart's on the run
I wanna be your boyfriend, 'cause you are the one
I wanna be your boyfriend, I know you're the one
I wanna be your boyfriend, they don't understand
I'm tryna be your boyfriend, Cuban link with the hand
I'm tryna be your boyfriend, and tell you what's up
I'm tryna be your boyfriend, but it's damaging, 'cause, 'cause

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
We the same (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Alright (Uh, woo, woo, woo, woo)
Alright (Ooh, woo, woo, woo, woo)
Alright (Uh, woo, woo, woo, woo)

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
I invested too much time
I done spent all of my money (Oh)
You need to read between the lines (Oh)
And stop pretending shit's funny (Yo)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Hey, hey, aw, this shit is money now
Say, say, aw, my heart is pumping now
Hey, hey, aw, we're getting funky, fuck what they
Say, say, aw, we should be together, baby
Never again, never again
I'm tryna be more than a friend, my heart's on the run
I wanna be your boyfriend, 'cause you are the one
I wanna be your boyfriend, I know you're the one
I wanna be your boyfriend, they don't understand
I'm tryna be your boyfriend, Cuban link with the hand
I'm tryna be your boyfriend, and tell you what's up
I'm tryna be your boyfriend, but it's damaging, 'cause, 'cause

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
We the same (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
We the same (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
We the same (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
We the same (One hundred percent)

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator, Charlie Wilson and Santigold]
Guessin', don't be guessin'
Guessin', don't be guessin' (I've seen all your cards, ooh, we are)
Guessin', don't be guessin' (I've seen all your cards, ooh, we are, ooh)
Guessin', don't be guessin' (I've seen all your cards, ooh, we are)
Guessin', don't be guessin' (I've seen all your cards, ooh, we are, ooh)
Guessin', don't be guessin' (I've seen all your cards, ooh, we are)
Guessin', don't be guessin' (I've seen all your cards, ooh, we are, ooh)
Guessin', don't be guessin' (I've seen all your cards, ooh, we are)
Guessin', don't be guessin' (I've seen all your cards, ooh, we are, ooh)
Guessin', don't be guessin' (I've seen all your cards, ooh, we are)

[Spoken Word: Jerrod Carmichael]
Exactly what you run from, you end up chasing. Like, you can't avoid, but just chasing it and just like trying. Giving it everything that you can. There's always an obstacle-
