[Intro: Young Nigga]
Ballin'

[Verse 1: Young Nigga]
Nigga we ballin'
All of my niggas get airtime
Niggas call burner "The Barber"
The way I put shit to his hairline
Nigga gotta problem, hit the nigga with the llama
If a nigga gotta problem, shoot a nigga in his dick
I'm the slumpy man
Good night little bitch it's bedtime
30 around my belt loop, and i'm not talking my waist size
Burner in the cut, nigga
Pasta eat that for lunch nigga
School of hard knocks I got a degree in
Swagging on you fuck niggas
I smoke like a Rasta
Eat like Italian that expensive pasta
You don't want that problem
I'm Dr. Dolittle, I talk to the llama
I should buy a whale I just bought a lion his name is Damonté
I just bought Bugatti, I drove all the way to San Clemente
Young Nigga spend thirty racks on his belt cuzz
Young Nigga got bread like a homeless shelter
I make snow angels with the cocaine
All my niggas keep heaters, we don't need jackets

[Hook: IceJJFish & Young Nigga]
I spent a lot of money, I’m happy
I slumped a fuck nigga, I’m happy
I fucked a Thotiana, I’m happy
I just bought a Bugatti, I’m happy

[Verse 2: IceJJFish]
Happy

You niggas can’t down me
I’m always happy
As long as I got money
And these bitches on me
They really want meee
Girl, get up on me
You know that I want you
You know what me, and money can do

[Hook: Young Nigga]
I spent a lot of money, I’m happy
I slumped a fuck nigga, I’m happy
I fucked a Thotiana, I’m happy
I just bought a Bugatti, I’m happy

[Verse 3: Jasper Dolphin]
Bad yellow bitch, oh god, she on me
Nasty nigga eat the pussy like macaroni

Turnt up nigga in the club
With a bad bitch, nigga I’m smoking bud
I don’t give a fuck, crash here in the club

Me and my partner, J
All we do is smoke weed, I’m over here

[Verse 4: IceJJFish]
Aba-akeh I kill 'em

Cause they see me on my shit, nigga
