[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Life after death, death after life
Made mistakes before, I swear I wasn't gonna do it twice
You love me and it wouldn't change
So I'm by myself which will remain the same
And it was just one girl who left me sprung
And it was just one girl who had me going dumb
And it was just one girl who was where I was from
Gave me her feelings and I left that bitch with none

[Verse 2: Tyler the Creator]
I was in love, but I jumped out quick
Gave her my heart, she broke it, put it in the bucket
On another level I'm bitter, I wanted to keep her
But now this shit is coming out your speaker
Wish that you could meet her
But she's chopped up in my freezer
By the mixed vegetables, I'll eat her
Looking in the iris, I knew she was lying
Cuz she wasn't crying, laughing
So I starting grabbing
And she started gasping for air
She told me the truth, I didn't care
The dead made me win
And her death made me grin
Like a mouth with a side of nipples and limbs
This the end, yeah
Potatoes and grits on the plate of her
I should have stayed away from her
But she cheated
And now she's in my freezer bleeding
Her parents looking for her, good luck
You dirty bitch

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
Met the bitch, tied the bitch up
And then I ate her up because she want to go and fuck my cousin up
Nigga's balls in the room and now this bitch is mad at me cause I made a song with autotune with my nigga G
She looking at me all mad and all sad
But now I'm glad that she's wrapped up in that Glad bag
And that shit's all black and I'm wearing all black
And now she mad cause I found out she was fucking, sucking other niggas
Busting, cumming, running, here I'm coming with a motherfucking knife and now I'm gunning
And now this bitch is screaming for help, yelp, dealt, the motherfucking card that she dealt
But that's her fucking fault, I don't give a fuck
I fucking more, she fucking one and now these cases that I caught
Shit, but I ain't even fucking tripping
I need a new chick, I'm sick of dealing with these bitches

In the club, niggas in the club
