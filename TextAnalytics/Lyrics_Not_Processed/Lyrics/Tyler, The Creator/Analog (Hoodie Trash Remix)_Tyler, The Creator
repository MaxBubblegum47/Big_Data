[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby could you meet me by the
I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby could you meet me by the

[Verse: Hoodie Trash]
My boy and I got kind of a thing
Hundred degree Florida heat
Take him out to buy some bling
In my Camry, take a seat
On Ryan’s sofa, making out
His trust in me would take a hit
Hope my dad won’t kick me out
But hope you into freaky shit
Golden rubbers in my jeans
Denim’s a look that I can rock
Playing Mario Kart in teams
With the bedroom door locked
Let’s drive up to Mickey Ds
Get some fries and then a shake
I know I love you, bitch, you see
So just meet my by the lake

[Hook: Tyler The Creator, *Tyler, The Creator and Hoodie Trash*]
I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby could you meet me by the
I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby could you *meet me by the lake*

[Bridge: Hoodie Trash}
Fuck, these lyrics are stupid

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby could you meet me by the
I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby could you meet me by the lake
