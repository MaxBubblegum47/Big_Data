[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
Cops tripping on a nigga cause they know I'm a black man
The flow dirty like a real stinky trash can
Niggas don't really want no problems, I got guns, I solve em
These bitch niggas know I sell crack like concrete
And if you don't believe me, you can find me in the streets
My niggas be listening to fucking N Sync
Mike, Doms The real shit, nigga in pink
Y'all niggas don't got problems ok niggas don't talk none of that stuff
Get muffed, give a fuck
And if you wanna laugh, I'll stick a fucking bundle of bananas in my ass
Pussy motherfuckers you need to shut the fuck up
You niggas need to learn me and Lionel in a fucking G rolling on sherm
Smoking PCP bath salt nigga
Y'all niggas just all talk nigga
Wolf gang don't bark nigga we bitch niggas
When we see the spark nigga, I call on the cops
Snitch on a nigga, I give no fucks
If you got a problem with my bitch y'all a pot
I got fake Gucci, I got fake Louis, I got a fucking dookie
I got a hoopty, bills ain't paid
Got a fucked up line up, with no fade
Nigga, Look at all of these asses over here
Y'all niggas wanna talk shit about my ears
Get your face took
Imma cyber bully and snitch on Facebook
Y'all niggas tell me that I'm ugly nigga
That shit ain't even funny nigga
My momma love me nigga, so i don't care about your opinion
