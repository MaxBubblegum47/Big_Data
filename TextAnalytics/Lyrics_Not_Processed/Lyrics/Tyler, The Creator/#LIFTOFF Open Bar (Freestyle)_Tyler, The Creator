I'm on the fucking bus and I just ate lunch
And I'm looking for a slut and I'm really tryna' bust a fat nut
On her motherfucking forehead, but damn, my iPhone dead, shit
I need a charger, fuck it I'll just go outside and charge a bitch
And tell the bitch to come on the bus and suck my shit
And maybe if I'm a little more horny, get little drunk, I can open up her and shit probably lick her clit
But shit, that probably won't happen, fuck
Fuckin' all this pussy off rappin', fuck
Man, they think I'm cool, they start to clappin', fuck it
Give me a hand job, yeah, I'm the man
I'm the motherfuckin' nigga that was just on stage
Bitch, open up your fucking book and let me lick that page
But wait a minute, that shit clean? Let me get spray out of the bathroom
Where I took a shit, took off my Fruit Of The Looms and took a doo-doo-doo
Poo-poo-poo, lick on your ass and poo-poo, doo-doo
You got a problem with T? Well fuckin' know a couple dudes that'll get the burner and shoot-shoot
And shoot-shoot if you got a problem, yeah bitch, get that
Get rat, nigga get that, nigga getgat, with the liklak and a Tic-Tac
Jasper rollin' up a zig-zag, after you suck my dick, here, take a Tic-Tac
And a fuckin' double mint, bitch I'm the devil men
Bitch know what the fuck I meant, heard Bastard

I'm, alright I'm off of here
