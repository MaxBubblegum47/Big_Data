[Intro]
Random disclaimer!
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay?
It's fucking fiction
If anything happens, don't fucking blame me
White America, fuck Bill O'Reilly
Four, three, two, one

[Verse 1]
What the fuck I look like? Saying I'm sorry
To a bunch of fucking fags that can't potentially harm me?
I ain't never gonna bow down to your expectations
By the way, I got sixty fucking wolves that'll guard me
That skate hard, Thrash' black hoodies, try something
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a Glad bag
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tyin' 'em with a shoestring

[Pre-Chorus]
And fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing

[Chorus]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical

[Post-Chorus 1]
(Left, right, left, right)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang
We came together cause
We ain't have nobody else
Do you?
You just might be one of us
Are you?

[Verse 2]
Fuck cops, I'm a fucking rockstar
Rebel and defiance makes my motherfucking cock hard
Fuck pigs, fuck guards, all some fucking retards
Fuck school, I'm a fuck up? Fuck Harvard
I ain't got no fucking money (hey mom)
I ain't got no motherfucking daddy, he ain't teach me shit
Child support ain't come, that faggot still ain't bought me anything

[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing

[Chorus]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical

[Post-Chorus 2]
(Left, right, left, right)
They want us to go to they schools and
Be fucking miserable at they fucking college, studying that bullshit
Fuck that
Do what the fuck makes you happy
'Cause at the end
Who's there? You

[Chorus]
Fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical

[Post-Chorus 3]
You hear that, nigga?
That's cult shit right there, nigga
Wolf Gang!
Fuck everybody else, nigga!
Stand for something, get money, nigga!
Wolf Gang in this bitch, nigga, we sixty deep
Fuck with me, nigga
Odd Future, nigga
Stand the fuck up!
I'm not saying just to go out and do some stupid shit, commit crimes
What I'm trying to tell you is
Do what the fuck you want
Stand for what the fuck you believe in, and don't let nobody tell you can't do what the fuck you want
I'm a fucking unicorn
And fuck anybody, who say I'm not
Wolf Gang

[Bridge]
Fuck your traditions, (and) fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion, (and) fuck your decisions
(See,) they're not mine, so you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Fuck your traditions, (and) fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion, (and) fuck your decisions
(See,) they're not mine, you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Fuck your traditions, (and) fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion, (and) fuck your decisions
(See,) they're not mine, so you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Go
You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go
You gotta let 'em go...

[Outro: Dr. TC & Tyler, The Creator]
You gotta let these shits go, man. It's not making sense to you right now, but... all these little dreams you got, they're not shit. All this rebellion, all this crazy shit you got, saying this shit... getting too old for this shit, man, you gotta grow out of it. Growing up, your dreams are getting bigger. You gotta look at reality, understand that shit, so you don't get caught. I'm just being real
Nigga, fuck you
I'm just trying to help you, man, trust me
Look, I mature day after day, nigga, you don't know shit, you're a fucking therapist
Whatever
