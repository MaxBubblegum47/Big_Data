[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
There's somethin' 'bout the way you pick your (cherry bomb) cherries, cherries
You blow me away
With your cherries
Make me feel like 4th of July
Cherries
You light my fireworks
There's somethin' 'bout the way you pick your (cherry bomb) cherries
You blow me away

[Bridge: Syd]
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la

[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
There's somethin' 'bout the way you pick your (cherry bomb) cherries, cherries
You blow me away
With your cherries
Make me feel like 4th of July
Cherries
You light my fireworks
There's somethin' 'bout the way you pick your (cherry bomb) cherries
You blow me away

[Bridge: Syd]
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la
