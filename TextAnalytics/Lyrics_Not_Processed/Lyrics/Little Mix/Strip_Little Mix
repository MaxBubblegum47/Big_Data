[Chorus: Jade,

, (Jesy) & 
Perrie
]
Take off all my make-up 'cause I love what’s under it
Rub off all your words, don't give a uh, I'm over it
(Jiggle all this weight, yeah, you know I love all of this)
Finally love me naked, sexiest when I’m confident

[Verse 1: Jade & 
Perrie
]
You say I ain't pretty
Well, I say I'm beautiful, it's my committee
Say we too provocative
Still look at me, look at me, look at me, yeah
Come for my girls, you blind
Daily Mail ratin', mañana a la noche
I don't owe you nothin'
Nah, I don't give a, no, not anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne w/ All,

Ah-ooh

If you got little boobs, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it
If you got a big ass, grab it, grab it grab it, grab it, grab it (
Ah-ooh
)
If you got nothing, babe, rock it
It’s your life, go get it, if you want it
Up in the mirror like, "Aw, yeah"
Lovin’ my figure like, "Aw, yeah"
When I'm slim or I’m thick, I'm like, "Aw, yeah"
Swear I'ma kill 'em like ah

[Chorus: Jade & 
All

Love who you wanna
Don't give a damn if it's a man or a woman
Wanna talk about colour?
It's the skin that I'm in, yeah, I get from my mama (Uh-huh)

Baby, I'm growing, my stretch marks are sexy

[Verse 3: Sharaya J]
First of all, you got to love who you are
Don't let social media tear you apart
H.B.I.C., I'm head Banji in charge
I'm ready and I got a hundred bars
I don't care if you got a hundred cars
I don't care if you got a hundred mil'
'Cause even if you had a hundred deals
That money won't buy you what confidence will
Skrrt, pull up with the drip (With the drip)
Got juice (Got juice), take a sip (Take a sip)
I'm so (Uh-huh) serious (What, what?)
Little Mix in a mix period (Period)
Still a cover girl, even with no makeup
Live your best life, even with your A-cups
I ain't gotta act, I just gotta be me
Put me on a track, I'ma ride like Kiki (Ayy)

Take off all my make-up 'cause I love what's under it
Rub off all your words, don't give a uh, I'm over it (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Strip!
Jiggle all this weight, yeah, you know I love all of this
Finally love me naked, sexiest when I'm- (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
