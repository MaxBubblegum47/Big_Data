[Verse 1]
I ain't lonely, but I spend a lot of time alone
More than I'd like to, but I’m okay with stayin' home
My how the last few months have changed
I’m smilin' more despite the pain

[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learnin' how to build a better boat

[Verse 2]
I hate waitin', ain't no patience in these hands
I'm not complainin', sometimes it's hard to change a man
I think I'm stronger than I was
I let God do what he does

[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin'  out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learnin' how to build a better boat

[Chorus]
I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin', what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out
Now and then I let it go, I ride the waves I can't control
If it's workin', I don't know, when I get done the thing may not float
But I'm learnin' how to build a better boat
