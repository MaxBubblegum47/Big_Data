[Intro: Stunna 4 Vegas]
Produced by Cre8
Uh, uh, uh
Put him in the air like he flyin'
Fuck a nigga
Gang shit

[Verse 1: Stunna 4 Vegas]
Put him in the air like he flyin'
All that cap in his raps, he lyin'
These niggas ain't living they punchlines
He want smoke, then I'm calling up one time
Hit his bitch, then I pass her to bro Hi-Five
Know I got that Glock when I ride
We got the chicken like Popeyes
Bitch, Stunna flexin' like Popeye

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
I stop yo' ass like a stop sign
Beat a lil' nigga up if he my size
Up that Glock on his ass, now he cock-eyed
Numbers high over there, low on my side
Guarantee to make any trap boom
We can't fuck at the crib, get a room
Get it in and I'm out of there, zoom
Left her hair on the floor, get a broom
I got a bitch for every single day of the week, I don't know what to do
You told that yo' day was Tuesday, I fucked you on Thursday, you got me confused
I'm Flavor Flav without the clock
I'm Nino Brown without the cops
I'm Eazy E without the AIDS
I'm Bobby Shmurda with the Glock
Yeah, everybody know I'm a hot nigga
We ain't gon' say too much, we just drop niggas
Give a fuck how you feel, you ain't my nigga
Why my dog look like that? He just try niggas
Better stay out our way, 'cause we do that
Get a fade once a week, fuck a durag
I flew in, fucked his bitch, then I flew back
Get a verse or a pound for like, two flat

[Verse 3: Stunna 4 Vegas]
Boy, I get on yo' head like a durag
So it's best that you use it, 'cause it can get blew back
I told my lil' nigga, "Shoot that"
I know for sure he gon' do that
No, we ain't coppin' no pleas
No, we ain't dodgin' no beef
We leave that shit in the streets
Slide down they block, leave an opp in the streets
We pick the rental with speed
I fuck that lil' thot, she a freak
Stunna a dog, no fleas
Whoop a rapper, put him on Say Cheese
Fuck a ho, I want bucks
Drop back like Andrew Luck
We catch a opp, he fucked
Tie his ass up and it's stuck (Cook 'em)
We trying to fry him
She want me like some designer
Clips on his head like a lineup
Rich Whammy fitness, come sign up
But you got to come with a homie
Wanna hang around me, catch a body
I play him close, I'm slimy
I say the word and they slide
