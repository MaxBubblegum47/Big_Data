[Chorus: DaBaby]
I'ma shoot at a nigga, no dribble (Go)
I pull up with two hundred 'bows in my rental (Go, go, go)
They was already sold when I sent 'em (Gone)
Take a Backwood, I put strong in the middle (Let's go)
On these lil' niggas' ass and they feel it
I hit a lil' bit of gas and I peel it (Zoom)
She like to talk when she fuck, she a freak
She got a lil' bit of ass and it jiggle (Go)
I'ma shoot at a nigga, no dribble (Go)
I pull up with two hundred 'bows in my rental (Go, go, go)
They was already sold when I sent 'em (Gone)
Take a Backwood, I put strong in the middle (Let's go)
On these lil' niggas' ass and they feel it
I hit a lil' bit of gas and I peel it (Zoom)
She like to talk when she fuck, she a freak
She got a lil' bit of ass and it jiggle (Go)

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle (Ah)
I give her dick, she walk out like it's Thriller (Yeah)
She do a dance on a the dick, make a Triller (Dance)
Make a TikTok on the dick, she official (Go)
Check my wristwatch, that's a motherfuckin' blizzard (Bling)
Icy, icy, icy, icy
She thinkin' 'bout sexin' a nigga, she like me
I'm having checks on me, nigga, I'm Nike
Do it, do it, do it, do it
These go for thirty-three, these bitches Ewings (Ews)
They put the box in the air and they flew it (Vroom)
Soon as they drop over there, they run through it
Run it, run it, run it, run it (Go, go)
Broke nigga unemployed, the nigga Tommy
He want a job, I paid him for the body
Pulled up beside 'em lookin' like my mommy

[Chorus: DaBaby]
I'ma shoot at a nigga, no dribble (Go)
I pull up with two hundred 'bows in my rental (Go, go, go)
They was already sold when I sent 'em (Gone)
Take a Backwood, I put strong in the middle (Let's go)
On these lil' niggas' ass and they feel it
I hit a lil' bit of gas and I peel it (Zoom)
She like to talk when she fuck, she a freak
She got a lil' bit of ass and it jiggle (Go)
I'ma shoot at a nigga, no dribble (Go)
I pull up with two hundred 'bows in my rental (Go, go, go)
They was already sold when I sent 'em (Gone)
Take a Backwood, I put strong in the middle (Let's go)
On these lil' niggas' ass and they feel it
I hit a lil' bit of gas and I peel it (Zoom)
She like to talk when she fuck, she a freak
She got a lil' bit of ass and it jiggle (Go)

[Verse 2: Stunna 4 Vegas]
I'ma shoot a nigga off the dribble (Bah)
I don't wanna argue, I'm poppin' his pimple (Poppin' his pimple)
She a freak, give me top through the zipper (Thot)
She dance on the D, I ain't finna tip her (Uh-uh)
I make her blush, I spent a bunch on my dutch (I make her blush)
I get him flushed, they let off a flood in his rental (Boom, boom)
I want him touched, then I put a ton on his mental (I want him touched)
We fill him with lead, he a pencil (Fill him up)
Fold that fuck nigga up like a pretzel, uh
I swing that stick like Wayne Gretzky (Baow)
Still in the field like a taxi (Uh)
I put dick on her, then hit her bestie (Uh-huh)
She give me face time, no textin' (Face time, no textin')
I'm havin' cake like a wedding (Cake)
Nigga play with this shit, it get deadly
Ayy, bitch-ass nigga, cuh

[Chorus: DaBaby]
I'ma shoot at a nigga, no dribble (Do it)
I pull up with two hundred 'bows in my rental (Do it, do it, go)
They was already sold when I sent 'em (Gone)
Take a Backwood, I put strong in the middle (Let's go)
On these lil' niggas' ass and they feel it

She like to talk when she fuck, she a freak
She got a lil' bit of ass and it jiggle (Go)
I'ma shoot at a nigga, no dribble (Do it)

She like to talk when she fuck, she a freak
She got a lil' bit of ass and it jiggle (Go)
