[Verse 1]
I’ve been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringin' me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singin' on my own
Now I can’t find the key without you

[Pre-Chorus]
And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
So, if you want the truth

[Chorus]
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

[Verse 2]
I’m sorry if it’s all too much
Every day you’re here, I’m healin'
And I was runnin' outta luck
I never thought I’d find this feelin'
'Cause I’ve been hearin' symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me (A rhapsody for you and me)
And every melody is timeless

[Pre-Chorus]
And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
So, if you want the truth

[Chorus]
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

[Interlude]
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on, to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth (Oh)

[Chorus]
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
