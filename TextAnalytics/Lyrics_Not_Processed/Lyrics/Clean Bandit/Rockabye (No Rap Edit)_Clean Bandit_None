[Verse 1]
She works the nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away from her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come, she's got to save him

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She tells him, "Oh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"
She tells him, "Your life
Ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"

[Chorus]
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye, no, oh oh, rockabye

[Verse 2]
She found her love, way too early
He left her there, with more than tears and hurt to carry
They said too young, what are you thinking?
They told the truth, she chose to use her heart and keep him

[Bridge]
Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When she says "oh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"

[Chorus]
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye, no, oh oh, rockabye

[Bridge]
Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe when she says

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She tells him, "Oh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"
She tells him, "Your life
Ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do", yeah

[Chorus]
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye, no, oh oh, rockabye
