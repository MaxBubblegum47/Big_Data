[Chorus: MNEK]
Before you came into my life
Everything was black and white
Now all I see is colour
Like a rainbow in the sky
So, tell me your love will never fade
That I won't see no clouds of grey
'Cause I don't want another
You bring colour to my life, baby

[Verse 1: MNEK]
Life was so heavy, I was giving up, na-na
But since you came along, I'm light as a feather, ah
You give me something incredible, sensational, baby
When we're together, everything is better
My darling

[Pre-Chorus 1: MNEK]
Only you can brighten up my day
You make everything change, you rearrange
So don't go away
Let me tell ya

[Chorus: MNEK & Hailee Steinfeld]
Before you came into my life
Everything was black and white
Now all I see is colour
Like a rainbow in the sky
So tell me your love will never fade
That I won't see no clouds of grey
'Cause I don't want another
You bring colour to my life, baby

[Post-Chorus: MNEK]
Now all I see is colour
You bring colour to my life, baby
Now all I see is colour
You bring colour to my life, baby

[Verse 2: Hailee Steinfeld & MNEK]
I never thought that I would meet anybody
Who knows my body how you know my body (ah, yeah)
I can't deny I see us stick'in around 'cause we paint the town
Anyway that we want it
Like red and yellow and pink and green
That's what I see when you're here with me
Everything is brighter 'cause the limit is the sky
Baby, that's the way you make me feel
You know that

[Pre-Chorus 2: Hailee Steinfeld, MNEK & Both]
Only you can brighten up my day, yeah
You chase all those grey clouds away (you chase all those clouds away)
You helped me find a brand new shade of me (me)
You make everything change, you rearrange
So don't ever fade (don't fade)
Don't fade, don't fade, don't fade, don't fade
You bring the colour, you bring the colour
Yeah, you bring the colour (oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld, MNEK & Both]
Before you came into my life
Everything was black and white
Now all I see is colour
Like a rainbow in the sky
So, tell me your love will never fade
That I won't see no clouds of grey
'Cause I don't want another
You bring colour to my life, baby (to my life)

Before you came into my life
Everything was black and white (now all I see is colour)
Now all I see is colour (now, all I see, I see, yeah)
Like a rainbow in the sky
So, tell me your love will never fade (tell me, tell me, tell me)
That I won't see no clouds of grey (tell me, tell me, tell me)

[Post-Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld, MNEK]
Now all I see is colour
You bring colour to my life, baby
Red and yellow and pink and green
That's what I see when you're with me
You bring the colour
You bring the colour (now all I see is colour)
You bring colour to my life, baby

[Outro: MNEK]
Aah
Na-na-na-na, na-na
Now all I see is colour
You bring colour to my life, baby
