Dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you’re holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
3. 

[BECCA]
That toot toot
Lemme give you that beep beep
Running her hands through my 'fro
Bouncing on 24s
While they say on the radio...

Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rolling

[Yeah...] I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go

10. 

[CALAMITY + EVERMOIST]
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence, caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head they are crying
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
11. 

[SADDLE UP]
What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn’t mean I’m lonely when I’m alone
What doesn’t kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn’t mean I’m over ‘cause you’re gone

Jump in front of a train for you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I’d do anything for you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Your words in my head, knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
And I'm o-

[SADDLE UP (+ EVERMOIST)]
Wake me up when it’s all over
(Zombie-ie-ie)
When I’m wiser and I’m older
All this time I was finding myself
I didn't know I was lost

What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger
Wake me up when it’s all over
(Zombie-ie-ie)
When I’m wiser and I’m older
All this time I was finding myself
You know I’d catch a grenade for you
I didn’t know I was lost
