[Verse 1]
I don't hate you
No, I couldn't if I wanted to
I just hate all the hurt that you put me through
And that I blame myself for letting you
Did you know I already knew?

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't even see you through the smoke
Lookin' back, I probably should have known
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone

[Chorus]
Loved me with your worst intentions
Didn't even stop to question
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven
Loved me with your worst intentions
Painted us a happy ending
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven

[Post-Chorus]
And it's so gut-wrenchin'
Fallin' in the wrong direction

[Verse 2]
On my tip-toes
But I still couldn't reach your ego
Guess I was crazy to give you my body, my mind
Don't know what I was thinkin' 'til now
Everyone thinks that you're somebody else
You even convinced yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't even see you through the smoke
Lookin' back, I probably should have known
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone

[Chorus]
Loved me with your worst intentions
Didn't even stop to question
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven
Loved me with your worst intentions
Painted us a happy ending
Every time you burned me down
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven

[Post-Chorus]
And it's so gut-wrenchin' (Ooh, ooh)
Fallin' in the wrong direction (Ooh, ooh)
How did you sweep me right off my feet?
Baby, I can't keep
Fallin' in the wrong direction
How did you sweep me right off my feet?
Right off my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't even see you through the smoke
Lookin' back, I probably should have known
But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleepin' alone

[Chorus]
Loved me with your worst intentions
Didn't even stop to question (No)
Every time you burned me down (Me down)
Don't know how; for a moment it felt like heaven
Loved me with your worst intentions
Painted us a happy ending (Ooh)
Every time you burned me down (Me down)
Don't know how; for a moment, it felt like heaven

[Post-Chorus]
And it's so gut-wrenchin'
Fallin' in the wrong direction
