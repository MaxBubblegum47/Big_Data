[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Turn my vocals up, alright

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody findin' their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up, I'm feelin' the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I've been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you, would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I, even need you? Should I leave you?
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you?
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

[Post-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
I gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is about...
Aight check this out

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Life is about makin' mistakes
It's also about trying to be great
Do not let failure scare you away
I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us, I can speak about it 'cause I did it (true)
Ladies and gentlemen, here's the exhibit
It's my life, look a little closer, you can see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waitin' for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
Tell me could you love me? Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you...

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly + Hailee Steinfeld]
This song's for anybody
Who feels like I did, never the cool kid
This song's for anybody
Who fought their way through, always remained true
This song's for anybody
The one's who trying to get it, the one's who dream it and live it
This song's for anybody
This song, this song, this song, this song, this song, this song

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
Ohh, I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

[Post-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
I gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is about...
