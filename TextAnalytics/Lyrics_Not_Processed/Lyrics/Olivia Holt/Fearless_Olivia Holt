[Chorus]
I'm stuck in your head, I'm back from the dead
Got you runnin' scared, I'm fearless
I'm callin' you out, I'm takin' you down
Don't you come around, I'm fearless
I'm fearless!
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 1]
I got the upper hand now, and you're losin' ground
You never had to fight back, never lost a round
I see the gloves are comin' off, tell me when you've had enough
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Ready for the showdown, and we're face to face
I think I'll rearrange it, put you in your place
You don't get the best of me, check it, you're afraid of me!

[Chorus]
I'm stuck in your head, I'm back, back from the dead
Got you runnin' scared, I'm fearless
I'm callin' you out, I'm takin' you down
Don't you come around, I'm fearless
I'm fearless!

[Verse 2]
You used to make my heart pound, just the thought of you
But now you're in the background, whatcha gonna do
Sound off if you hear this, we're feelin' fearless
We're feelin fearless!

[Chorus]
I'm stuck in your head, I'm back, back from the dead
Got you runnin' scared, I'm fearless
I'm callin' you out, I'm takin' you down
Don't you come around, I'm fearless

[Outro]
I'm stuck in your head, I'm back, back from the dead
(I'm fearless) Got you runnin' scared, I'm fearless
(I'm fearless) I'm callin' you out, I'm takin' you down
Don't you come around, I'm fearless
I'm fearless!
