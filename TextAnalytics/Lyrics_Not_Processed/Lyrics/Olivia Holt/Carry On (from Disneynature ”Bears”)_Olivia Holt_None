[Verse 1]
There's always going to be some canyon in the way
There's always going to be a river I can not cross
Somewhere along this path that's chosen me
I know I'm gonna fall down, feel lost, feel weak
But wherever it leads

[Chorus]
No one said this would be easy, my love
But I will be by your side when the impossible rises up
We will travel this life well-worn
No matter the cause, no matter how long
We will leave our footprints behind

[Post-Chorus]
And carry o-on
Carry o-on
Carry o-on
Carry o-on

[Verse 2]
Some will ride you off before you ever started
Some will say the journey's just too hard, hum
Somewhere between right here and the other side
There will be fear in dot in the deep dark night
But we will survive, yeah

[Chorus]
No one said this would be easy, my love
But I will be by your side when the impossible rises up
We will travel this life well-worn
No matter the cause, no matter how long
We will leave our footprints behind

[Post-Chorus]
And carry o-on
Carry o-on
Carry o-on
Carry o-on

[Bridge]
We may fall behind
Lose miles along this road
We will be alright
I will never let you go

[Chorus]
No one said this would be easy, my love
But I will be by your side when the impossible rises up
We will travel this life well-worn
No matter the cause, no matter how long
We will leave our footprints behind

[Post-Chorus]
And carry on
And carry on
