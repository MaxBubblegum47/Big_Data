[Verse 1]
I can feel you comin' from a mile away
My pulse stops racin' from the words that you say
And you say so many of them like you don't have a clue
That I'm signed, sealed, delivered with a stamp on

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to try too hard
You already have my heart
You don't gotta thing to prove
I'm already into you
So...

[Chorus]
Hold, hold, hold, hold me tight now
Cause I'm so, so good to go
Don't say, don't say good night you know
You had me @ hello
You had me @ hello
You had me @ hello
Don't say, don't say good night you know
You had me @ hello

[Verse 2]
Close your mouth now, baby, don't say a word
Cause you ain't sayin; nothin' I ain't already heard
Plus, all them words get buried when the beat's so loud
And the speakers blowin' up to this dance song

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to try too hard
You already have my heart
You don't gotta thing to prove
I'm already into you
So...

[Chorus]
Hold, hold, hold, hold me tight now
Cause I'm so, so good to go
Don't say, don't say good night you know
You had me @ hello
You had me @ hello
You had me @ hello
Don't say, don't say good night you know
You had me @ hello

[Bridge]
Oooooh, Ooooh, ooh, ooh
Oooooh, Ooooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, aaah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to try too hard
You already have my heart
You don't gotta thing to prove
I'm already into you (oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah)
So...

[Chorus]
Hold, hold, hold, hold me tight now (tight now)
I'm so, so good to go (so good to go)
Don't say, don't say good night you know (you know)
You had me @ hello
(You had me) You had me @ hello
(You had me) You had me @ hello
Don't say, don't say good night you know (you know)
You had me @ hello
