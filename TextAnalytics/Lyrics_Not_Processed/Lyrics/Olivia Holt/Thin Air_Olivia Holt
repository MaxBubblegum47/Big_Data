[Verse 1: Olivia Holt]
People keep stoppin' me
People, they're noticin' somethin' is different
Everything's different 'bout me
I was just mindin' my business
When I saw the light, somethin' is different
Everything's different this time

[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Holt]
Don't stop takin' all of my time, make it all yours
Keep on, 'cause my heart likes the rush
So please give me more, more, more, more

[Chorus: Olivia Holt]
Boy, this is crazy 'cause ya' came out of thin air
You must be magic
Whatcha doin', it ain't fair
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)
You got that perfect timin', baby
And I swear our chemistry is glowin'
Made the whole world stare
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)

[Refrain: Olivia Holt]
Boy, you came out of thin air, thin air, thin air
Like you always been there, been there, been there
Before you, I didn't care, I didn't care, I didn't care
You came out of thin air, you came out of thin air

[Verse 2: Olivia Holt]
I want gold with your love
I won't ever give you up
Pull me in closer
Not scared to admit I want your touch
Your voice is a symphony
Singin' sweet melodies
Pull me in closer
'Cause when my world's over, ya' got me

[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Holt]
Don't stop takin' all of my time, make it all yours
Keep on, 'cause my heart likes the rush
So please give me more, more, more, more

[Chorus: Olivia Holt]
Boy, this is crazy 'cause ya' came out of thin air
You must be magic
Whatcha doin', it ain't fair
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)
You got that perfect timin', baby
And I swear our chemistry is glowin'
Made the whole world stare
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)

[Refrain: Olivia Holt]
Boy, you came out of thin air, thin air, thin air
Like you always been there, been there, been there
Before you, I didn't care, I didn't care, I didn't care
You came out of thin air, you came out of thin air

[Verse 3: Jordan Fisher]
Oh!
Like you checkin' on me
Yeah, I've been watchin', too
It's like you're just a diva
But, baby, it's because of you
You never knew I felt this, too
But now we're here with nowhere left to hide
The way you're lookin' at me, it's how I look at you
Don't need space in between
Just cut the tension right through
Real soon, we can fly to thin air to check the view
Ye-yeah!

[Chorus: Olivia Holt]
Boy, this is crazy 'cause ya' came out of thin air
You must be magic
Whatcha doin', it ain't there
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)
You got that perfect time and baby
And I swear our chemistry is glowin'
Made the whole world stare
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (yep!)

[Refrain: Olivia Holt]
Boy, you came out of thin air, thin air, thin air
Like you always been there, been there, been there
Before you, I didn't care, I didn't care, I didn't care
Came out of thin air, you came out of thin air
