[Verse 1]
I got all of these bad thoughts in my head (ooh-ooh)
Spent too many cold nights in my bed
Feelin' so lonely
I hate feelin' lonely (turn up!)
Gon' give you that good love you deserve (ooh-ooh)
Gon' give you that "Ah" touch, till it hurts
Just want you on me
Hey, say that you want me (heh!)
Turn up!

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta pocket full of gold
What's your vice?
Anywhere you wanna go?
Well, just ask nice
You caught me on a good day
Oh, tell me what you like
I'll get it right
I'll. Get. It. Right

[Chorus]
I’ma taker, not a giver, but I'm into to you
And the way you lookin' at me got me in the mood
I’m feelin' generous
Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha
I’m feelin' generous
Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha
So, let's have the type of night you never had before
Give you all of my attention, then I'll give you more
I’m feelin' generous
Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha
I’m feelin’ generous
Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha
Turn up!

[Verse 2]
You don't gotta feel guilty, just lose control (ooh-ooh)
Kinda makin' me dizzy
You know it’s not your fault
You make me want you
You know I look good on you
I look good on you, on you, babe
Turn up!

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta pocket full of gold
What's your vice?
What's your vice?
Anywhere you wanna go
Well, just ask nice
Just ask nice
You caught me on a good day
Oh, tell me what you like
I'll get it right
I'll. Get. It. Right

[Chorus]
I’ma taker, not a giver, but I'm into to you
And the way you lookin' at me got me in the mood
I’m feelin' generous
Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha
I’m feelin' generous
Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha
So, let's have the type of night you never had before
Give you all of my attention, then I'll give you more
I’m feelin' generous
Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha
I’m feelin’ generous
Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha
Turn up!

[Bridge]
Gotta pocket full of gold
What's your vice?
Anywhere you wanna go?
Anywhere you wanna?
Well, just ask nice
Just ask nice
You caught me on a good day (good day)
Oh, tell me what you like (what you like)
I'll get it right
I'll. Get. It. Right

[Chorus]
I’ma taker, not a giver, but I'm into to you
And the way you lookin' at me got me in the mood
I’m feelin' generous
Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha

Ha, ha, ah, ha, ha
So, let's have the type of night you never had before
Give you all of my attention, then I'll give you more
