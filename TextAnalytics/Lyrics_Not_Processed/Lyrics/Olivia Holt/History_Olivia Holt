[Verse 1]
Sorry, I don't really see this workin' out
It's nothin' you did
I just can't do this right now
No easy way to say this and I don't know how
It's nothin' ya' did
But here goes lettin' you down

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you're so perfect
But he's the perfect one for me
I know that you're worth it
But somethin' 'bout him gets to me
Gets to me, all I need
Plus, we got history

[Chorus]
I used to love him, he used to love me
Yeah, we go way, way, way, way back
We love, love, love like that
(Now)
Now, I still love him, and he still loves me
Yeah, we go way, way, way, way back
We love, love, love like that
(We go way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way back)

[Verse 2]
I didn't know I felt the way I did before
It's nothin' I did
Now, I guess I'm sure
It's like we never really ever closed that door
It's nothin' we did
But, now, our hearts want more

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you're so perfect
But he's the perfect one for me
I know that you're worth it
But somethin' 'bout him gets to me
Gets to me, all I need
Plus, we got history

[Chorus]
I used to love him, he used to love me
Yeah, we go way, way, way, way back
We love, love, love like that
(Now)
Now, I still love him, and he still loves me
Yeah, we go way, way, way, way back
We love, love, love like that
(We go way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way back)

[Interlude]
Baby, you're so perfect
But...
Baby, you're so perfect
But...
Baby, you're so perfect
But (he's the perfect one for me)
Baby, you're so perfect
But (he's the perfect one for me)

[Breakdown]
Baby, you're so perfect
But he's the perfect one for me
I know that you're worth it
But somethin' 'bout him gets to me
Gets to me, all I need
Plus, we got history

[Chorus]
I used to love him, he used to love me
Yeah, we go way, way, way, way back
We love, love, love like that
(Now)
Now, I still love him, and he still loves me
Yeah, we go way, way, way, way back
We love, love, love like that
I used to love him, he used to love me
Yeah, we go way, way, way, way back
We love, love, love like that
(Now)
Now, I still love him, and he still loves me
Yeah, we go way, way, way, way back
We love, love, love like that

[Outro]
Yeah, we go way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way back
