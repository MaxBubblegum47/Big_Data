[Verse 1]
I guess it's one of those nights
When I'm bound to want you, bound to want you
I guess it's one of those nights
When I'm fighting the truth, fighting the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You show up and it's out the blue
You know how I wouldn't want you to
And it kills us
'Cause we both know that we're not well
There's so much love it feels like hell
And it kills us

[Chorus]
All my instincts keep pulling me into you
Tryna stay distant 'cause I don't wanna make a
Wrong move, wrong move, wrong move
Back to you, back to you
Wrong move back to you

[Verse 2]
Are we really surprised that we're not in control, not in control?
Hey, are we really surprised when both of us fall, both of us fall?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'll show up when it's out the blue
I know you wouldn't want me to
And it kills us
'Cause we both know that we're not well
There's so much love it feels like hell
And it kills us

[Chorus]
All my instincts keep pulling me into you
Tryna stay distant 'cause I don't wanna make a
Wrong move, wrong move, wrong move
Back to you, back to you
(You want more, you want more
You want more, you want more)
Wrong move back to you

[Bridge]
There's something about you
Empty without ya
I'm moving closer back to you
You said that it's over
Over and over
Still, I'm moving closer back to you

[Chorus]
All my instincts keep pulling me into you
Tryna stay distant 'cause I don't wanna make a
Wrong move, wrong move, wrong move
Back to you

But all my instincts keep telling me that it's love
Tryna stay distant but I'm dying to make a
Wrong move, wrong move, wrong move
Back to you, back to you
(You want more, you want more
You want more, you want more)
Wrong move back to you
