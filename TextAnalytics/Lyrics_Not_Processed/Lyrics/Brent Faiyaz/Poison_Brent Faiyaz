[Intro Skit]
I feel like there's no such thing as a relationship with condoms
It's 
a
 one

That's it, real shit
Gotta go raw
I-I know that’s what Fay ‘bout

Real shit
You know, they says, without is better so

No pull out game
Pull out game weak
No condom
It's embarrasing
That's what they say
That's what the- That's what they say
And girls hate condoms too, everybody hate condoms
Yeah condoms are just terrible dog
Except for the people who got burned before
Niggas need- niggas need to live like the 70's and shit
I mean shit, if we talking and you doing that thing bro, after two three times bro, that shit like
Two or three?
This nigga said the first time

[laughing]
For real?

It's funny how certain bitches you'll hit raw and then the other ones you just like
Yo it's just the vibe dog
Yeah you gotta feel the vibe

Ah that's true
I'll start thinking who the fuck she gon' ask
Word
Word, that's true
I won't be thinking so...

[Verse 1]
Know you ride it right
I might just die tonight
But you know i'm still coming through baby
I know its bad for me
And you know it tastes so sweet
I think i need your abuse baby

[Chorus]
Girl you do damage to me
You know I love it, Yeah I love you
Ain't nothing better for me now
Girl you do damage to me
You know, I love it, yeah I love you
Ain't nothing better for me now
Than your poison baby

[Verse 2]
Angel of the night
Drown between your thighs
I'm still here, ain't no excuse baby
I see you in my sleep
I'm scarred beyond belief
Ain't nothing you can't make me do, baby

[Chorus]
Girl you do damage to me
You know I love it, Yeah I love you
Ain't nothing better for me now
Girl you do damage to me
You know, I love it, yeah I love you
Ain't nothing better for me now
Than your poison baby

Girl you know I play my role when i'm inside that
With my hands around your throat I know you like that
Girl I'll do anything
To hear you scream my name, I love your game, I do, I do

[Outro]
Girl you do damage to me
But i love it babe
Oh you're poisonous baby
