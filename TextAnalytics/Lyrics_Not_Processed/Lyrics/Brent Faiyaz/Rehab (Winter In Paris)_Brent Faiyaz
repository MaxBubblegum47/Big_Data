[Verse 1]
I got too many hoes
But they ain't you
You like to put that shit in your nose
But I still love you
Be doing shit that nobody knows
In the streets, they be thinkin' you a lady
But at home (You a motherfuckin' porn star, I swear to God)
(Home)

[Chorus]
If you ain't nasty, don't at me (Nasty)
I been workin' all day (All damn day)
I like to run the streets 'til it's dark out and then come home and blow your back out
I hope that's okay
I can’t leave you alone, 'lone, 'lone
(Not for no 24 hours) (All damn day)

[Verse 2]
Lately I been thinkin' 'bout us (About us, about us, about us)
You as real as they come
But you would rather be on them drugs (Drugs, the drugs, the drugs)
And I would rather hang with my thugs
Fuckin' with you been drainin' me out, you know that?
But you blow that well, where that throat at?
You better kiss it before I go (Oh)
(You a motherfuckin' porn star, I swear to God)

[Chorus]
If you ain't nasty, don't at me (Nasty)
I been workin' all day (All damn day)
I like to run the streets 'til it's dark out, then come through and blow your back out
I hope that's okay
I can’t leave you alone, 'lone, 'lone
(All damn day)

[Outro]
(All damn day)
(About us, about us, about us)
(All damn day)
(Drugs, the drugs, the drugs)
(All damn day)
(Cool)
