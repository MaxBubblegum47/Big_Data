[Chorus]
Wanna fuck the world I’m a walkin' erection
Spend without a thought, we do it reckless
Your nigga caught us texting
You said, “Baby don’t be mad, you know how Brent is”

[Verse 1]
Don’t open your mouth if you ain’t speaking good to me
I ain’t built like him
You fuckin' with a G
Just 'cause I fuck you, that don’t mean I trust you, I don’t
You got some high hopes
High hopes, baby
Fuck me crazy and I’ll tell you 'bout me
I was nothin' at all
Took a trip to London just to hear how they talk
Back to 410
You should hear how they talk
He might be Mr. Track and Field but I done ran through 'em all
Yeah that nigga play D1 but you still watch how we ball
I ain’t never home for long but you pull up when I call
All the hood niggas respect me
Strippers wanna sex me
You bluffed on him
Now he mad because you let me
If it ain’t fucked up don’t change it
I’d prolly be dead if I was basic
Would you still give me head if I had day shifts?
I work when I want
I do what I want
She get what she want
I call her my wishing wand
Wash it off when you top me off you know I be slumped

[Chorus]
Wanna fuck the world I’m a walkin' erection
Spend without a thought, we do it reckless
Your nigga caught us texting
You said, “Baby don’t be mad, you know how Brent is”
Your nigga caught us texting
You said, “Baby don’t be mad, you know how Brent is”

[Verse 2]
Don’t come around, if you ain’t close to me
I ain’t built like them, you gotta work for me
Just 'cause I haunt you it don’t mean I want you, I don’t
You got some high hopes
High hopes

[Chorus]
Wanna fuck the world I’m a walkin' erection
Spend without a thought, we do it reckless
Your nigga caught us texting
You said, “Baby don’t be mad, you know how Brent is”
Your nigga caught us texting
You said, “Baby don’t be mad, you know how Brent is”
