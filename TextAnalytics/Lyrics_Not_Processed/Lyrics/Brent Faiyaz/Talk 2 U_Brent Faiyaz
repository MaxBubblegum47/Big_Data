[Verse 1]
I bet they say the same damn thing
Got niggas paying top dolla to holla
Talking 'bout that pretty brown frame
And I don't mean the impala, that you just hopped out of
Go on 'bout yo' business
You must be religious
'Cause God done took her time on
And you're tired of hearing those same old lines

[Chorus]
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
I know we
(Tend to look the same to you)
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
Put me on
(How does one get on with you?)
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
I know we
(Tend to look the same to you)
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
How does one?
(How does one get on with you?)

[Verse 2]
Truth is, I came to know ya
Don't give a damn about the things they told ya
'Cause they don't have a clue
But they don't read you like I do
You don't need champagne
You'd rather be held tight and maintained
I wanna know everything about you
But first I gotta talk to you

[Chorus]
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
I know we
(Tend to look the same to you)
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
Put me on
(How does one get on with you?)
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
I know we
(Tend to look the same to you)
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
How does one?
(How does one get on with you?)

[Bridge]
If you don't mind
I wanna be the only one in your mind
And if you don't mind
I wanna get the chance to spend some time
Can I talk to you?
Can I talk to you?

[Chorus]
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
I know we
(Tend to look the same to you)
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
Put me on
(How does one get on with you?)
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
I know we
(Tend to look the same to you)
Can I
(Talk to you 'bout something new?)
How does one?
(How does one get on with you?)
