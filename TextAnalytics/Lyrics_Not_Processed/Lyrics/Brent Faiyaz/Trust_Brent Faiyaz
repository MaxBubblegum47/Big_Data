[Intro]
Either you down or you ain't
You either riding or you can't
Down or you ain't

[Chorus]
You told me I could trust you, don't lie
I could really use it
(Everybody need love, even niggas like me)
(You down or you ain't)
You told me I could trust you
And I could really use it

[Verse 1]
So much I wanna talk about
But I ain't got no one to talk to (Shit, I don't)
I'm always tryna work it out
But somehow it always falls through
And I know that I get rough
But I just wanna feel love sometimes
(Either you down or you ain't)
(You either riding or you can't)
Real shit, bitch

[Chorus]
You told me I could trust you 
(Stay ten toes for a nigga
)
Don't lie (I ain't running game on you)
I could really use it
 (Stay ten toes for a nigga)
I could use your love and your trust (You down or you ain't)
You told me I could trust you (Stay ten toes for a nigga)
(The more I tell you, the more you wanna know)
(Shorty, stay ten toes for a nigga)
And I could really use it
(If I tell you, will you use it when I'm low?) (Stay ten toes for a nigga)

[Verse 2]
Hood fame, everybody know my name when I come through
But don't nobody scream it like you
I was having visions wit' you
Doin' things, switching lanes in the Beamer with you
And swimming in deep water, save me from my sorrows
Swimming in deep
Just some peace is all I need
So why can't I get that for free?

[Chorus]
You told me I could trust you 
(Stay ten toes for a nigga)
Don't lie
 (I ain't running game on you)
I could really use it
 (Stay ten toes for a nigga)
I could use your love and your trust (You down or you ain't)
You told me I could trust you (Stay ten toes for a nigga)
(The more I tell you, the more you wanna know)
(Shorty, stay ten toes for a nigga)
And I could really use it
(If I tell you, will you use it when I'm low?) (Stay ten toes for a nigga)

[Outro]
You told me I could trust you (Stay ten toes for a nigga)
Don't lie (I ain't running game on you)
I could really use it (Stay ten toes for a nigga)
I could use your love and your trust
You told me I could trust you (Stay ten toes for a nigga)
(The more I tell you, the more you wanna know)
(Shorty, stay ten toes for a nigga)
And I could really use it
(If I tell you, will you use it-)
