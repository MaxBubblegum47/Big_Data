[Verse 1: Emeli Sandé]
I don’t do yoga, never tried Pilates
Not many people want me at their parties
Tryna find my place, some place, oh I, oh I, oh I
I drink a little more than recommended
This world ain’t exactly what my heart expected
Tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
See, whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
But, whoa, at least I am free, I am free

[Verse 2: Emeli Sandé]
If you ask the church then I am no believer
Spend Sundays asleep I'm just another dreamer
Still tryna find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
I guess I ain’t too good for money either
I got two left feet, no, I'm no Jackson neither
Just tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
See, whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
But, whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free
Yeah, whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
But, whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free

[Verse 3: Nas]

The lord said vengeance is mine
So with your duplicitous mind
You gotta be insane not to see
You want the game to be what the game cannot be
It's a heavy chain that locks he who cannot mentally be free
So they years for eternity
I don't let nothing worry me
My boy just came home from serving three
Years, his girl loves someone else and he fears
He's gonna do something else to someone
To put himself back in the trap
Coz he couldn't adapt
And the streets
Only in jail he feels free
It's so sorry

Just tryna' find my way home
Home sweet home
Yeah...

[Bridge: Emeli Sandé and Nas]
I drink a little more than recommended
This ain’t exactly what my heart expected
(It's ok, yo...it's ok)
(We'll all be alright)
(We'll all be alright)
Let's go

[Hook: Emeli Sandé and Nas]
Whoa, c’est la vie
(Yeah, just life)
Maybe something’s wrong with me
(Ain't nothing wrong with you)
But whoa, at least
(Yeah, yeah)
I am free, oh, oh, I am free
(I am free, I am free, again)
Whoa, c’est la vie
(Yeah, yeah)
Maybe something’s wrong with me
(Yeah, yeah)
But, whoa, at least
(Let's ride our way home)
I am free, oh, oh, I am free
(Nah, that's the way, Rudimental)
(Yeah, yeah)
Whoa, c’est la vie
(Put your hands in the air, yeah)
Maybe something’s wrong with me
(Put your hands in the air, yeah)
Whoa (Just tryin' to find my way someway) at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free
(Say, I'm free, I am free, again)
Whoa, c’est la vie
(C'est la vie)
Maybe something’s wrong with me
(Something's wrong with me, oh)
Whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free
Whoa
(Yeah, yeah..)
