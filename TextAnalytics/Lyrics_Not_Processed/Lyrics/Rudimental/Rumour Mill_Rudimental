[Verse 1: Will Heard]
It's on a rumour mill, the word is on the street, I
I don't know how to feel about what you say to me, I
Cause the party pills, they won't give me no release, I
Nothing but a cheap thrill, no chance of a remedy, no

[Pre-Chorus: Will Heard]
The bad things be spreading round
No, no, let it go, just turn it down
Don't be a fool, don't be a clown
Can't tell me, won't tell me nothin' anyhow
Bad things be spreading round
No, no, let it go, just turn it down
Either way I'm coming round
Can't tell me, won't turn me down

[Chorus: Will Heard]
I, I don't even care about what they say
I don't even care about what they say
I don't even care about what they say, say, say, say, yeah

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
It's on a rumour mill, word is on the street, I
I love you so, the feeling's bittersweet, I
How do you like me now? I'm at the crossroad you can't reach, I
Don't test me now, cause it's a test that you can't cheat

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Bad things be spreading round
No, no, let it go, just turn it down
Won't be a fool, won't be a clown
Can't tell me, won't tell me nothin' anyhow
Bad things be spreading round
No, no, let it go, just turn it down
Either way I'm coming round
Can't tell me, won't turn me down

[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Will Heard]
I don't even care about what they say
I don't even care about what they say
I don't even care about what they say, say, say, say, yeah
I don't even care about what they say
I don't even care about what they say
I don't even care about what they say, say, say, say, yeah

[Bridge: Will Heard & 
Anne-Marie

Nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, how
Nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, how
Nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, how
Nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, how
It's on a rumour mill
Nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, how
It's on a rumour mill
Nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, how
It's on a rumour mill
Nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, how
It's on a rumour mill
Nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, how
Nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, how
Nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, nothin' anyhow, how

[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Will Heard]
I don't even care about what they say
I don't even care about what they say
I don't even care about what they say, say, say, say, yeah
I don't even care about what they say
I don't give a damn what they say about me
Nothin' anyhow, how, how, how
