[Intro - Nas]

Yeah
Nas, Emeli... Rudimental
Just Tryna' find my way home
Home sweet home
Uh

[Verse 1 - Emeli Sandé]

I don't do yoga, never tried Pilates
Not many people want me at their parties
Tryna find my place, some place, oh I, oh I, oh I
I drink a little more than recommended
This world ain’t exactly what my heart expected
Tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I

[Hook - Emeli Sandé]

See, whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
But, whoa at least I am free, oh oh I am free

[Verse 2 - Emeli Sandé]

If you ask the church then I am no believer
Spend Sundays asleep I’m just another dreamer
Still tryna find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
I guess I ain’t too good for money neither
I got two left feet, no, I’m no Jackson either
Just tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I

[Hook - Emeli Sandé X2]

See, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa at least, I am free
Oh oh I am free

[Verse 3 - Nas]

The lord said vengeance is mine
So with your duplicitous mind
You gotta be insane not to see
You want the game to be what the game cannot be
It's a heavy chain that locks he who cannot mentally be free
So they years for eternity
I don't let nothing worry me
My boy just came home from serving three
Years, His girl loves someone else and he fears
He's gon[na] do something else to someone
To put himself back in the trap
Coz he couldn't adapt
And the streets
Only in jail he feels free
It's so sorry

Just tryna' find my way home
Home sweet home
Yeah...

[Emeli Sandé]
I drink a little more than recommended
Coz this ain't exactly what my heart expected
[Nas]
It's okay though
It's ok
We gonna be alright
We gonna be alright
Let's go

[Hook X2]
[Nas]
C'est la vie
Yeah such is life
[Emeli Sandé]
Maybe something's wrong with me
[Nas]
Ain't nothing wrong with you
Yeah
I am free
I am free
Again

[Outro - Nas]

Let's find our way home:
Nas, Emeli, Rudimental

[Hook]

[Nas]
I am free... Yeah
