[Intro: John Newman]
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel it ah-ah
I can feel it ah-ah
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel it ah-ah
I can feel it ah-ah

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Yeah 'Bino young nigga with the most money
Take her home, skeet skeet-her like I'm Doug Funnie
Patti Mayonnaise, Pax in my left hand, green light (let it go)
Sounds so minimal, smooth as criminal
I say it to your face, I don't do subliminal
Nigga to Maybach, I wouldn't say that
Nah, bullshit so I KIM I got on your top 10
These niggas is not playing
These niggas like god damn
They saying what I'm saying
You didn't know him now you know
Feel the love cause the magnum broke
It's all love, nigga, X and O
I don't fiend for the cream
Life in my lap, is it nice as it seems?
Ask Google map where the mansion at
Brick oven in my backyard, getting soft serve, I don't act hard

[Hook- John Newman & Childish Gambino]
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel it ah-ah
(I don't really feel the love, so I'mma stop 'til the beat's a hug)
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel it ah-ah
I can feel it ah-ah

[Verse 2- Childish Gambino]
I got my goons on deck
The only nigga not worried 'bout who's up next
The only nigga with chains that'll bruise your neck
At 23 I had my first million, holes on the ceiling, hoes want my children
Sorry to the haters, man, they don't know the feeling
Keenan and Kel-ing, ah here it goes
And you already know
And I'm argh on her throat
B sound like he bringing '88 back
Beasting while I'm hanging out with A-Trak
Fucking with Migos, his flow is unbeatable
Unbelievable, holy ghost
And he voted most quotable
Nigga wanna go toe to toe
Top of the totem pole
Nigga I told you so, nigga I told you so
We don't get told what to do, so feel the love, it was all for you

[Outro]
I gotta tell you
I gotta tell you (tell you)
I gotta tell you (tell you)
It was all for you
I gotta tell you (tell you)
I gotta tell you (tell you)
We don't get told what to do, so feel the love, it was all for you
I can feel the love, can you feel it too?
I can feel it ah-ah
