I was wrong when I hurt you
But did you have to hurt me too
Did you think revenge will make it better?
I don't care about the past
I just want our love to last
There's a way to bring us back together
I must forgive you (I must forgive you)
You must forgive me too (we must have to try)
If you wanna try to put things back the way they used to be
(honey let's start again)
'Cause there's no sense in going over and over
The same things as before
So let's not bring the past back anymore
(no looking back, we can't look back)
(honey let's start again)
Out of all the good we had
You only keep track of the bad
Though you knew I never really loved her
Didn't anyone tell you yet
That to forgive is to forget
How can you be mad if you don't remember
I must forgive you (I must forgive you)
You must forgive me too (we must have to try)
If you wanna try to put things back the way they used to be
(honey let's start again)
'Cause there's no sense in going over and over
The same things as before
So let's not bring the past back anymore
(no looking back, we can't look back)
(honey let's start again)
I must forgive you
And you must forgive me too
It's the only thing that's left that we haven't try to do
One thing I'm sure will work
That we haven't tried before
Let's not bring the past back anymore
(no looking back, no looking back)
(honey let's start again)
