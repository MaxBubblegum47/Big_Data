[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]
(Ghostbusters)
If there's something strange
In the neighborhood
Who you gonna call
(Ghostbusters)
If there's something weird
And it don't look good
Who can you call
(Ghostbusters)
I'm calling
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid

[Hook 1: Patrick Stump]
Uh, I'm not afraid
Who are you calling now?
Ca-calling now?
(Ghostbusters)
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid
Yeah, yeah
(Ghostbusters)

[Verse 2: Patrick Stump]
If you're seeing things
Running through your head
Who you gonna call
(Ghostbusters)
An invisible man
Sleeping in your bed
Oh, who you gonna call
(Ghostbusters)

[Hook 2: Patrick Stump]
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
Uh, I'm not afraid
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
If you're all alone
Pick up the phone and call
(Ghostbusters)

[Verse 3: Missy Elliot]
I can't sleep when I'm home alone
Night time my lights on
Woo, got me scared
Woo, and I need my bed
In my closet down the hall
I see shadows all on my wall
Man these monsters be big and tall
Ghostbusters, who you gon' call?
They roll up to my house, the knocking on my door
They come busting in, killing all the ghosts
It's so strange in my neighborhood
Look out the window and it ain't too good
I ain't afraid so let's get to it
Smoke these ghosts like backwoods

[Outro: Patrick Stump]
Listen, I'm not a- I'm not a-
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
Ooh, I'm not afraid, not afraid
Ooh, I'm not afraid
Now who you calling?
(Ghostbusters!)
Now who you calling out?
Now who you calling out?
Now who you calling?
(Ghostbusters!)
Now listen...
Bustin' makes me feel so
Bustin' makes me feel so
Bustin' makes me feel good!
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, not afraid
Ooh, I'm not afraid!
(Ghostbusters!)
