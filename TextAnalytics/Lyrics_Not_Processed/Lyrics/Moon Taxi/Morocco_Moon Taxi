[Verse 1]
So sick and tired of the pouring rain
I took a train to Morocco just to kill the pain
Oh it might help a little, it might help a lot
I don't know, but it's all I got
Ran down the aisle to find a window by the bar
I blew a cigarette to pieces so I lit up a cigar
Oh this might hurt a little, this might hurt a lot
I don't know, but it's all I got

[Chorus]
Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know
Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know

[Verse 2]
Crossing the desert when I lost the caravan
I found a compass in a box buried underneath the sand
Oh it might help a little, it might help a lot
I don't know, but it's all I've got
Running in circles I was losing my mind
When you found me and you led me to the water just in time
Oh this might hurt a little, this might hurt a lot
I don't know, but it's all I got

[Chorus]
Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know
Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know
Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know
Oh, Morocco
Oh, Morocco

[Break]
(It's all I got)
(It's all I got)
(It's all I got)

[Chorus]
Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know
Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know
Oh, Morocco
Tell me where you've been
Won't you tell me what you know
Oh, Morocco
Oh, Morocco
