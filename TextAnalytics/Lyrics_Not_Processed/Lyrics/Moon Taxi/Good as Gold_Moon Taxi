[Verse 1]
You've got your eyes on the ceiling
I've got my eyes on the prize
Once more again now with feeling
Watch it materialize
When the elevator comes back down
It isn't gonna wait around

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Now we're looking good as gold
Hey, hey, hey
Higher than a rocket go
Deeper we dive
Over our heads
We're so alive
Sleep when we're dead
Hey, hey, hey
Now we're looking good, now we're looking good as gold

[Verse 2]
We gonna burn up the minutes
We gonna blow out the fuse
You've come a mightly long way to fade at the finish
Cause when the elevator leaves the ground
It isn't gonna come back down

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Now we're looking good as gold
Hey, hey, hey
Higher than a rocket go
Deeper we dive
Over our heads
We're so alive
Sleep when we're dead
Hey, hey, hey
Now we're looking good, now we're looking good as gold

[Bridge]
Now we're looking good as gold
See how we shine when we turn out the lights
See how we shine when we turn out the lights
See how we shine when we turn out the lights
See how we shine when we turn, when we turn out the lights

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Now we're looking good as gold
Hey, hey, hey
Higher than a rocket go
Deeper we dive
Over our heads
We're so alive
Sleep when we're dead
Hey, hey, hey
Now we're looking good, now we're looking good as gold

[Outro]
Now we're looking good as gold
Now we're looking good as gold
See how we shine
We turn out the lights
Now we're looking good as gold
Now we're looking good as gold
