[Verse 1]
Getting out while we can
Waves are crashing on the sand
Wash away with the tide
Or walk away right by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
We're on our own
You and me together
We will make it known
And sing out forever

[Chorus]
Someday, someday
Out of the dark we go
Someday, someday
Into the year zero
Oh oh, oh oh
Into the year zero
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 2]
Pick me up when I'm down
Get my feet back on the ground
Holding on with our hands
I need you here to help me stand

[Pre-Chorus]
We're on our own
You and me together
We will make it known
And sing out forever

[Chorus]
Someday, someday
Out of the dark we go
Someday, someday
Into the year zero
Oh oh, oh oh
Into the year zero
Oh oh, oh oh
We'll do it on our own

[Bridge]
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh, oh oh
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh, oh oh

[Chorus]
Someday, someday
Out of the dark we go
Someday, someday
Into the year zero
Oh oh, oh oh
Into the year zero
Oh oh, oh oh
We'll do it on our own

[Outro]
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh, oh oh
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh, oh oh
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh, oh oh
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh, oh oh
