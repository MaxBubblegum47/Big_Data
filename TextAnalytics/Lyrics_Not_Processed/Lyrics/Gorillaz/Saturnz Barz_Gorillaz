[Chorus 2: 2D & 
Popcaan
]
All my life
I'm in the stakin' bar,
 
I got debts, I'm a debaser
All my life
Saturn's about to make love and I'm just a heartbreaker
All my life
And I won't get a take in 'cause I'm out when I'm stakin
'
And the rings I am breakin'
 
are makin' you a personal debt

[Bridge: 2D & 
Popcaan
]
With the holograms beside me, I'll dance alone tonight
In a mirrored world, are you beside me
All my life?
Distortion

[Chorus 2: 2D & 
Popcaan
]
All my life
I'm in the stakin' bar,
 
I got debts, I'm a debaser
All my life
Saturnz about to make love and I'm just a heartbreaker
All my life
And I won't get a take in 'cause I'm out when I'm stakin'
And the rings I am breakin'
 are makin' you a personal debt
