[Intro]
Gangsta
Gangsta Grillz

[Chorus]
I know that we got it, I might even guarantee it
When she top me up, it turn me right into a parapalegic
Pair of shoes that got the NB on 'em, make you stare and see 'em
We ain't paying for 'em, nah, you oughta know I'm wearing free ones (Ooh)
When you ghosting me, I gotta know, is there a reason?
It was so abrupt, I kind of had to think that there would be one (Be one, uh)
Conversations out of state, they asking, "Where are we from?"
I don't care about ya, I got me a chick that's Caribbean

[Verse 1]
She want me to serenade her, but you know I'm bashful (Ooh)
I got all the whipper-snappers and the lil' rascals (Yeah)
Turnt up off the way we drippin' with Tabasco (Bitch, yeah, yeah)
Old friends inquiring about the cash flow (Okay, okay)
Okay, this kush here in the gaseous state
I can't hit it, if I do I might pass away
These boys fake, please quit with the masquerade, ayy
Shit, I hear what the pastors sayin'
I could prolly use a fresh start, out the window of the TARC
I'm reflectin' on life through Cherokee Park
Thinkin' 'bout life through Cherokee Park (Woo)

[Chorus]
I know that we got it, I might even guarantee it
When she top me up, it turn me right into a paraplegic
Pair of shoes that got the NB on 'em, make you stare and see 'em
We ain't paying for 'em, nah, you oughta know I'm wearing free ones (Gangsta)
When you ghosting me, I gotta know, is there a reason? (Gangsta Grillz)
It was so abrupt, I kind of had to think that there would be one (Be one, uh)
Conversations out of state, they asking, "Where are we from?"
I don't care about ya, I got me a chick that's Caribbean (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
It's a push start, I ain't gotta put the key in
Whip it real nice like a good human being
24 East, I'm in Chattanooga, TN
Yeah, the barbecue Korean and my shorty muy bien, ayy
We just went from dive bars to The Colosseum
Man he's a try-hard, wouldn't wanna be him
PG, I'm the GM, go 'head copyright it, TM
Go 'head copyright it (Uh)

[Refrain]
Nah we don't wanna say too much (Much)
We ain't take her from you, no, she came to us
Ain't no steak dinner, but we made through brunch (We might)
2for on the beat, you know he came through clutch
Know he came through clutch (Came through)

[Chorus]
I know that we got it, I might even guarantee it
When she top me up, it turn me right into a paraplegic
Pair of shoes that got the NB on 'em, make you stare and see 'em
We ain't paying for 'em, nah, you oughta know I'm wearing free ones (Ooh)
When you ghosting me, I gotta know, is there a reason?
It was so abrupt, I kind of had to think that there would be one (Be one, uh)
Conversations out of state, they asking, "Where are we from?"
I don't care about ya, I got me a chick that's Caribbean
