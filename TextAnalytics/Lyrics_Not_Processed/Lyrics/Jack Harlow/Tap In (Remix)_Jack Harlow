Told her, "Uh-uh, must be crazy" (No go)

Pretty skin, pretty feet, and she kinda thick (Go)
Like to talk her shit while she bouncing on the dick
Do it on the dick, girl, she look me in my eyes
When she do it, she a big girl (Ooh), I might have to tap in
I love that she a freak, the type to pull it out
And eat it in the driveway while I back in

[Verse 4: Jack Harlow]
I just crossed over to Top 40
I can't even say "What's poppin'?" now, 'cause it got corny
Jeweler just hit me, said he got some new rocks for me
When they asked me to do this verse, know I got horny (Ooh, ooh)
I know I can count on my shorty
She'll go the extra mile, over the top for me
I ain't at the club, I'm in the house, but I'm not Cory
It's a Victorian, they built it with five stories (There's five of them bitches, mm)
Ayy, shout-out to Saweetie (Saweetie)
These boys working with the LMPD (Mm)
Back in seventh grade, I was selling CD's
I can tell they want from me to help them be me, okay (I can't, I can't)
Okay, tap, tap, tap in (Tap in, tap in)
Woo, buckle up, get strapped in (Strapped in, strapped in)
She said my voice is attractive (Attractive)
Baby, that's a Kentucky accent

[Chorus: Saweetie]
Lil' waist, fat ass, bitch, tap in
Tap, tap, tap in
Diamonds dancing on your neck, nigga, tap in
Tap, tap, tap in
Fuck a nigga, get rich, bitch, tap in
Tap, tap, tap in
M-O-B, Icy Gang, nigga, tap in
Tap, tap, tap in
