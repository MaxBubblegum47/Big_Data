[Chrous: Jack Harlow]
Y'all ain't get to see what I foresaw coming
Now the team overseas out in Warsaw, stuntin' (Ooh!)
Talk tough to me catch a northpaw from it
Ass fat, let me pull the booty shorts off of it, one time
She gon' get divorced off of it
'Cause she in the crowd screamin', gettin' hoarse off of it
Two girlfriends, damn, of course y'all cousins
It's a Lambo', watch them pull the doors off of it
MTV, Jam of the Week
And that's why she dancing with me (Ayy)
And that's why she dancing with me (Ayy)
And that's why she dancing with me, oh yeah
This the jam of the week
And that's why she dancing with me
Drop down, go and put your hands on your knees
I just want the free trial, I'ma cancel the fees, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus: Jack Harlow]
I don't want her with the strings attached (Ayy)
I just wanna see you drop back (Like a, like a, like a)
Like a, first string quarterback (Ooh!)
Off the pack, contact

[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
Ooh, she slid through
We can smoke something then sip the juice
Two Keys or the Tin Roof (Tin Roof)
I got something that I gotta tend to
But in the meantime, push clouds, we going in
Look down, she going in
Can you look out for my best friend?
And bring another pretty girl in with you

[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
Y'all ain't get to see what I foresaw coming
Now the team overseas out in Warsaw, stuntin' (Ooh!)
Talk tough to me catch a northpaw from it
Ass fat, let me pull the booty shorts off of it, one time
She gon' get divorced off of it
'Cause she in the crowd screamin', gettin' hoarse off of it
Two girlfriends, damn, of course y'all cousins
It's a Lambo', watch them pull the doors off of it
MTV, Jam of the Week
And that's why she dancing with me (Ayy)
And that's why she dancing with me (Ayy)
And that's why she dancing with me, oh yeah
This the jam of the week
And that's why she dancing with me
Drop down, go and put your hands on your knees
I just want the free trial, I'ma cancel the fees, oh yeah

[Verse 2: 2forwOyNE]
Hey, turned the studio into the night show
She gon' treat the meat like it's a tightrope (What)
Wrap it up, gyro
Ask me if I'm coming, Hell if I know
Feisty, she gon' throw it on the white tee, ayy
She so contagious, Ronald Isley
Ask me if I'm faded told her, "Damn, I might be"
She wanna see just what the hype be
Leveled up, ayy, fill my cup, 'til it's enough (Ayy)
Double stuff, how I'm two rounds in the guts
She know how I'm coming
Lately I been Warsaw stuntin'

[Chorus: Jack Harlow]
Y'all ain't get to see what I foresaw coming
Now the team overseas out in Warsaw, stuntin' (Ooh!)
Talk tough to me catch a northpaw from it
Ass fat, let me pull the booty shorts off of it, one time
She gon' get divorced off of it
'Cause she in the crowd screamin', gettin' hoarse off of it
Two girlfriends and of course y'all cousins
It's a Lambo', watch them pull the doors off of it
