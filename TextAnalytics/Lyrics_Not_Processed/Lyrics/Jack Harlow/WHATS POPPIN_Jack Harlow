[Chorus]
What's poppin'? (
Pooh, you a fool for this one
)
Brand new whip just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options (
Oh Lord, Jetson made another one
)
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh)
My body got rid of them toxins (Mmh, mmh)
SportsCenter, top ten

[Verse]
I could put the ball in the end zone, put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro, Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit (He a fool)
Told her don't let her friends know (Don't)
In the 'Ville and I move like a don (Don)
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls (Pre-roll)
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego (She do)
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego (Can't do it)
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, "Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?" (It does)
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn
Spending money at the club like Sam's (Cha-ching)
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam
But she don't put this on the 'Gram (Nah)
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram (Ayy)
I can't switch on the fam (Bitch)
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan (Hit that shit)
This where my head is (Listen)
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (Damn)
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections (Ooh)
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (Facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (Ooh, period, but)
I like to call it a passion, I can't be sitting relaxin' (Nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction, I'm at the venue, it's packed in (Packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me and she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction, that's my type and she Latin (That's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (Soft, real soft)
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then (Nah)
My swag, they keep jackin' (Keep on jackin')
I ain't doin' no verse, quit askin' (Quit askin')

[Chorus]
What's poppin'? (
Pooh, you a fool for this one
)
Brand new whip just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh)
My body got rid of them toxins (Mmh, mmh)
