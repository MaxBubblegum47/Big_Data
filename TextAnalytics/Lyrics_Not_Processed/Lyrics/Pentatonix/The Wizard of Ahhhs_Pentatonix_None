Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lulla...
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown way
Every brick every door every slamming board blown away
Blown away
Falling from cloud nine
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Blown away, tonight
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lollipop
Oh lolli lolli lollipop
Lollipop
Shoes
Shoes
Don't want no short short man
Let's get some shoes
Shoes
Don't want no short short man
I got my ticket for the long way round
Two bottle whiskey for the way
And I sure would like some sweet company
And I'm leaving tomorrow, what do you say?
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears but boy they bawl
When Iâ€™m thinkin' 'bout ya you know know know
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya you know know know
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya, do ya?
Do, do you got a first aid kit handy
Do, do you know how to patch up a wound tell me
Are, are are you patient understanding?
Cause I might need some time to clear the hole in my heart
And I've tried every remedy and nothing seems to work for me
Damaged, damaged
Damaged, damaged
I thought that I should let you know
That my heart is damaged, damaged
So damaged, so damaged
And you can blame the one before
I can't be tamed
I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed
I can not be...
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on you now
Took me to places I've never been
You're just a lion on the cold hard ground
Oh-a, Ay-ay, Oh-a, Ay-ay, Oh-a, Ay-ay, Ay-aayyaaa, Ay-aayyaaa aya
I'm living in that Emerald City please
Doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters
Got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking I just count the hour
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
21st century schizoid man
Don't want no money

[I like your beard]
Just want those shooooes
Ain't no wizard that can save you
From The Witch of The Westside

[Ah hahahahaha
I'll get you and your little dog too]
Cause there ain't no place you can hide
Show me your feet

[Show them to me!]
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

[Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!]
You know I'm a dreamer
My heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
I'm on my way-ay
I'm on my way-ay home sweet home
I'm going home
To the place where I belong
Home sweet home
Sweet love is always there
Waiting for me
Oh it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons that fill you with fear
Just know you're not alone
I'm gonna make this place a...
Home
I'm just too far
From where you are
I wanna go home
And now I'm on my way-ay
I'm on my way-ay home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way-ay
I'm on my way-ay home sweet home
Somewhere over the rainbow
