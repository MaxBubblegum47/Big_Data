[Verse 1: Scott (Mitch)]
Tell me, am I going crazy?
Tell me, have I lost my mind?
Am I just afraid of loving?
Or am I not the loving kind?

[Pre-Chorus: Scott, Kirstie & Mitch]
Kissing in the moonlight, movies on a late night
Getting old
I've been there, done that
Supposed to be hot but it's just cold
Somebody wake up my heart, light me up
Set fire to my soul, yeah
Cause I can't do it anymore

[Chorus: Kirstie, Scott & Mitch]
Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love (yeah)

[Verse 2: Scott (Mitch)]
Maybe I'm too picky honey
But I'm not in the world you're in
I'm not in it for the money
I'm here looking for the real thing

[Pre-Chorus 2: Scott, Kirstie & Mitch]
Kissin' in the moonlight, movies on a late night
Gettin' old (It's gettin' old)
I've been there, done that
Supposed to be hot but it's just cold (So, so, so cold)
Somebody wake up my heart, light me up
Set fire to my soul (to my soul, to my soul, to my soul)
Cause I can't do it anymore, no

[Chorus: Kirstie, Scott & Mitch]
Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love

[Bridge: Scott]
I'm tired of dreaming I'm no one (I'm tired)
I need some body next to mine (I, I'm tired, yeah)
Cause I'm trying to give it to someone (Give it to someone)
Because I can't do it any more

[Verse 3: Tink]
Rejected heart, feels like a veto
We can't last if your love is incognito
A bit of time, that's all that I ask
You know you leave me out too long and I'll go bad
Verbatim, I'm hot as a volcano
You want a taste, you better be bringing more to the table
Speaking of, I want your love sweet as Sweet and Low, low, low
(Come on) Come set me on fire
You gotta be the man of my desire
Yes, I'm yearning, butterflies returning
To get the usual
Get deep as a swimming pool, yeah yeah
Bottled up with all of these emotions
You know I got to pour this out to someone
My sweet love

[Chorus: Kirstie, Scott & Mitch]
Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love
