Angela, do you really love me
Or is this a game you play
Can I believe the tender words you say
Or is this my final day with you
Angela

Do you remember
That night you told me that you loved me so
You held me tight as if you'd never let me go
What do I know of you
Angela

Angela, the world was made for you and me
A love like ours was meant to be
We're strong together can't you see

So, if you love me
I promise I will never, never let you go
I'll think about that night you said you loved me so
Or was it a show
Angela
Tell me, mama

Angela, the world was made for you and me
A love like ours was meant to be
We're strong together can't you see

So, if you love me
I promise I will never let you go
I'll think about that night you said you loved me so
Or was it a show

Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela
Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela
Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela
Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela
