[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I wanna drive until my cell phone
Runs out of range and every bar is gone
Cut through the woods another hundred miles
And disappear for a while

[Chorus]
I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette, in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low

[Verse 2]
I wanna end up nowhere on a map
A little cabin sitting so far back
Out in the country just the moon and stars
Are gonna know where we are

[Chorus]
I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette, in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Just lay low, slow it down
Girl, let's go... and get outta town!..
I wanna hear raindrops falling down

[Chorus]
I wanna hear raindrops falling down on an old tin roof
I wanna find a front porch rail and prop up my traveling boots
See your silhouette, in that firelight
Feel your body lying next to mine
Spend a few days together alone
And just lay low...

[Outro]
Oh just lay low
Just lay low...
