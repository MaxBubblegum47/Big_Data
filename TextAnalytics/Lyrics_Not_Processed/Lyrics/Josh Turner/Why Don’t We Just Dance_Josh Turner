[Verse 1]
Baby why don't we just turn that TV off?
Three hundred fifteen channels
Of nothing but bad news on
Well, it might be me, but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

[Verse 2]
Guess the little bitty living room ain't going to look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's going to be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beating
Nobody's going to see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

[Chorus]
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

[Verse 3]
Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on?
Those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on
On second thought, just the way you are
Is already driving me crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

[Chorus]
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?
I'll cut a rug

[Outro]
Well it might be me but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Oh baby, why don't we just dance?
