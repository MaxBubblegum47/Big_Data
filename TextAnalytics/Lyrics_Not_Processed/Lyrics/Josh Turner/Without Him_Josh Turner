[Verse 1]
Without him, I could do nothing
Without him, I'd surely fail
Without him, I would be drifting
Like a ship without a sail

[Chorus]
Jesus
Oh Jesus
Do you know him today?
Do not turn him away
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
Without him, how lost I would be

[Verse 2]
Without him, I would be dying
Without him, Iâ€™d be enslaved
Without him, life would be hopeless
But with Jesus, thank God I'm saved

[Chorus]
Jesus
Oh Jesus
Do you know him today?
Do not turn him away
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus
Without him, how lost I would be

[Outro]
Wihtout him, how lost I would be
