[Verse 1]
There's a long black train coming down the line
Feeding off the souls that are lost and crying
Rails of sin, only evil remains
Watch out, brother, for that long black train
Look to the heaven's, you can look to the sky
You can find redemption staring back into your eyes
There is protection and there's peace the same:
Burning your ticket for that long black train

[Chorus]
Because there's victory in the Lord, I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train

[Verse 2]
There's an engineer on that long black train
Making you wonder if the ride is worth the pain
He's just a-waiting on your heart to say:
"Let me ride on that long black train."

[Chorus]
But you know there's victory in the Lord, I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train

[Verse 3]
Well, I can hear the whistle from a mile away
It sounds so good but I must stay away
That train is a beauty making everybody stare
But its only destination is the middle of nowhere

[Chorus]
But you know there's victory in the Lord, I say
Victory in the Lord
Cling to the Father and his Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train

[Outro]
I said cling to the Father and his Holy name
And don't go riding on that long black train
Yeah, watch out brother for that long black train
That devil's a-driving that long black train
