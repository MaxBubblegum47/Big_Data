[Verse 1]
Long hair across the room, baby, she got that glow
I know you see me over here, so dance on me real slow
We've been goin' for about two hours
And I don't even know your name
So, baby, please reveal, reveal

[Chorus]
Your friends are calling you, baby, stay with me instead
I know you're sayin' that you're tired
There's a little dance in ya left
Even if I go, I'll still think of you in my bed
Of the good time, good time, good time we had. 

[Instrumental]
The scent of your perfume has got me lost in a haze
And, oh, this moment depends on the records that the DJ plays
Baby, move a lil bit closer 'cause I wanna feel you, babe
I wanna feel you babe 
Your friends are calling you, baby, stay with me instead
I know you're sayin' that you're tired
There's a little dance in ya left
Even if I go, I'll still think of you in my bed
Of the good time, good time, good time we had
