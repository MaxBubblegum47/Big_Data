[Verse 1]
Over the horizon
She's smooth sailin'
These concrete seas
Now she's headed
East down the boule - the vard

[Hook]
Sugar
Said I like the way (like the way)
Said I like the way (like the way)
You sail your ship down
Let me be your cargo

I won't wear you down
No honey I won't
Wear you down

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I don't really know
Her destination
But I got a feeling I
Get to be your passenger
Sugar let me be your passenger

[Hook]
Sugar
Said I like the way (like the way)
Said I like the way (like the way)
You sail your ship down
Let me be your cargo

I won't wear you down
No honey I won't
Wear you down

[Chorus]
She's smooth
Smooth sailin' (Smooth sailin' yeah)
She's smooth
Smooth, darling

[Instrumental]

[Rerain]
Sweet pretty baby
Won't you be my lady, oh
Sweet Honey, darling
You know I'm calling
I want you

[Hook]
Sugar
Said I like the way (like the way)
Said I like the way (like the way)
You sail your ship down
Let me be your cargo

I won't wear you down
No honey I won't
Wear you down

[Chorus]
She's smooth
Smooth sailin' (Smooth sailin' yeah)
She's smooth
Smooth, darling

[Refrain]
Sweet pretty baby
Won't you be my lady, oh
Sweet Honey, darling
You know I'm calling
I want you

[Outro Hook]
Sugar
Said I like the way (like the way)
Said I like the way (like the way)
You sail your ship down
Let me be your cargo

I won't wear you down
No honey I won't

Wear you down
