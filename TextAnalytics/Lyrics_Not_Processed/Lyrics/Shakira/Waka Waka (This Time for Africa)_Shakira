[Letra de "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" ft. Freshlyground]

[Verse 1: Shakira]
You're a good soldier, choosing your battles
Pick yourself up and dust yourself off, get back in the saddle
You're on the front line, everyone's watching
You know it's serious, we're getting closer, this isn't over

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
The pressure's on, you feel it
But you got it all, believe it
When you fall get up, oh oh
If you fall get up, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
'Cause this is Africa

[Chorus: Shakira]
Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

[Verse 2: Shakira]
Listen to your God, this is our motto
Your time to shine, don't wait in line, y vamos por todo
People are raising their expectations
Go on and feed them, this is your moment, no hesitations

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
Today's your day, I feel it
You paved the way, believe it
If you get down get up, oh oh
When you get down get up, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

[Chorus: Shakira]
Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
Anawa a a
Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

[Verse 3: Zolani]
Awabuye lamajoni, ipikipiki mama wa A to Z
Bathi susa lamajoni, ipikipiki mama from East to West
Bathi waka waka ma eh eh
Waka waka ma eh eh
Zonk' izizwe mazibuye 'cause this is Africa

[Bridge]
Tsamina mina, Anawa a a
Tsamina mina
Tsamina mina, Anawa a a

[Chorus: Shakira]
Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
Anawa a a
Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

[Outro: Shakira]
Django eh eh

Tsamina mina zangalewa
Anawa a a
This time for Africa
This time for Africa
We're all Africa
We're all Africa
