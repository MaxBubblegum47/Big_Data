[Verse 1]
You shoot to kill
And heart of steel
I can't get away, no no
Honestly
There's no one else but me to blame

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I try my best to cut you out
Tell myself that I don't need you now

[Chorus]
But it doesn't make sense
If I don't got you under my skin and messing with my brain
If I don't got you pulling my strings and taking hold of me
If I don't got you, (it doesn't make sense)
If I don't got you

[Verse 2]
You got me trapped (oh)
Ain't no way back to who I used to be, no no
Call off the search
There's no one else but me to blame

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I've tried my best to cut you out
But it's clear to see I'm all yours now

[Chorus]
But it doesn't make sense
If I don't got you under my skin and messing with my brain
If I don't got you pulling my strings and taking hold of me
If I don't got you, (it doesn't make sense)
If I don't got you

[Bridge]
I surrender
Ain't nothing else I can do
I surrender
Tell me what you wanna do
Don't remember
Me before you
I surrender
Ain't nothing else I can do

[Chorus]
But it doesn't make sense
If I don't got you under my skin and messing with my brain
If I don't got you pulling my strings and taking hold of me
If I don't got you under my skin and messing with my brain
If I don't got you pulling my strings and taking hold of me
If I don't got you, (it doesn't make sense)
If I don't got you (it doesn't make sense)
If I don't got you (it doesn't make sense)
If I don't got you (if I don't got you)
