[Verse 1]
When you took your love away
And you forgot to give my heart back to me
What's the use of these memories?
Now I can't feel, no I can't feel a thing
Now that you're a runaway
Don't you think that you could be the judge of me?
It was love that made me this way
Now I can't feel, no I can't feel a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna rewind, regret
I don't need to forgive, forget
And I thought you'd ought to know

[Chorus]
That you made me heartless
You left without a sound, made me heartless
My body's falling to the ground and regardless
We will never ever finish what we started, started
You made me heartless
Sleeping by myself, that's the hardest
You left me on the shelf in the darkness
And ever since the moment that we parted
I've been heartless

[Verse 2]
You hit like a hurricane
And I know not to get in your path again
It was love that made me this way
Now I can't feel, no I can't feel a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna rewind, regret
I don't need to forgive, forget
And I thought you'd ought to know

[Chorus]
That you made me heartless
You left without a sound, made me heartless
My body's falling to the ground and regardless
We will never ever finish what we started, started
You made me heartless
Sleeping by myself, that's the hardest
You left me on the shelf in the darkness
And ever since the moment that we parted
I've been heartless

[Bridge]
You threw my heart away
Will someone bring it back to me?
You threw my heart away

[Chorus]
You made me heartless
You left without a sound, made me heartless
My body's falling to the ground and regardless
We will never ever finish what we started, started
Made me heartless
Sleeping by myself, that's the hardest
You left me on the shelf in the darkness
And ever since the moment that we parted
I've been heartless, oh woah
Heartless, ooh
I've been heartless
