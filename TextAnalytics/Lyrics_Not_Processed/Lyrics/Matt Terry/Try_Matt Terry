[Verse 1]
Got the world on your shoulders
Ain't nobody could've warned you
Scraping by, that's just life
Wish I could've, would've told you
Afraid it's coming up towards you
So hold on tight, and keep your head up high

[Pre-Chorus]
These days just fade away
And that's the make or break
Straight out of luck but no giving up
So try (try), to show me the real emotion
I know you're bruised and broken
I just wanna see you try

[Chorus]
Give me all or give me nothing
Show me that you're feeling something
I don't wanna see you shy
I just wanna see you try
Give me all or give me nothing
Show me that you're feeling something
I don't wanna see you shy
I just wanna see you try

[Post-Chorus]
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
I just wanna see you try

[Verse 2]
You're overcoming every hurdle
Then backing up into reversal
One day you're fine then you lose your mind
Got no reason to be nervous
So bring your heart up to the surface
Now I'm by your side so keep your head up high

[Pre-Chorus]
These days just fade away
And that's the make or break
Straight out of luck but no giving up
So try (try), to show me the real emotion
I know you're bruised and broken
I just wanna see you try

[Chorus]
Give me all or give me nothing
Show me that you're feeling something
I don't wanna see you shy
I just wanna see you try
Give me all or give me nothing
Show me that you're feeling something
I don't wanna see you shy
I just wanna see you try

[Post-Chorus]
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
I just wanna see you try

[Bridge]
I just wanna see you try
Oh baby, say you'll try, oh oh oh oh yeah
I just wanna see you try

[Chorus 2]
Give me all or give me nothing
Show me that you're feeling something
I don't wanna see you shy, hey
I just wanna see you try (you try)
Give me the good good, sell me something
Show me when you're feeling loving
I don't wanna see you shy
I just wanna see you try

[Post-Chorus]
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
I just wanna see you try
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
Hey na na na, hey na na eh
I just wanna see you try
