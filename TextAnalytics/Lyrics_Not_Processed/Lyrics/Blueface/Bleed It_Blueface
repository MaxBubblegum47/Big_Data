[Intro]
Pull up on your block, then I bleed it
CÃ¡llate, Mike 
Crook
Blueface, baby
Yeah aight
Pull up on your block, then I bleed it

[Chorus]
Pull up on your block, then I bleed it (Bleed it)
Slidin', if I don't drop somethin', I can't leave it (I can't leave it)
Wock' got me poured, but this TEC got him leanin' (Got him leanin')
Never let the beef get cold, where's the meetin'?
(Where's the meetin'?)
Pull up on your block, then I bleed it (Bleed it)
Slidin', if I don't drop somethin', I can't leave it (I can't leave it)
Wock' got me poured, but this TEC got him leanin' (Got him leanin')
Never let the beef get cold, where's the meetin'? (Where's the meetin'?)

[Verse 1]
Fuck a handgun, bitch, I brought a MAC in (MAC in)
Gotta keep a technical in case a nigga hackin' (Hackin')
Glock with a dick on my lap, I'm in traffic (Traffic)
My pistol bloated, ready to unload it ('Load it)
Pop up least expected, like a notice (Notice)
Famous Crip, everywhere I go, people notice
I started to notice, you gotta watch the people closest (Closest)
Dozin' off in this Benz 'cause I can afford not to focus
Glock make 'em disappear, hocus pocus (Hocus pocus)
I work too hard, bitch, I'm never lackin' (Never lackin')
I tote pistols, you niggas typin' all captions (Yeah aight)
I'm really poppin', you niggas need to stop cappin' (Stop cappin')

[Chorus]
Pull up on your block, then I bleed it (Bleed it)
Slidin', if I don't drop somethin', I can't leave it (I can't leave it)
Wock' got me poured, but this TEC got him leanin' (Got him leanin')
Never let the beef get cold, where's the meetin'?
(Where's the meetin'?)
Pull up on your block, then I bleed it (Bleed it)
Slidin', if I don't drop somethin', I can't leave it (I can't leave it)
Wock' got me poured, but this TEC got him leanin' (Got him leanin')
Never let the beef get cold, where's the meetin'? (Where's the meetin'?)

[Verse 2]
Pull up on your block, then I bleed it (Bleed it)
Slidin', if I don't drop somethin', I can't leave it (I can't leave it)
I don't get mad, dumb nigga, I get even
 (I get even)
You've been rappin', I just do this on the weekend (On the weekend)
They don't wanna believe it, so I had to repeat it (Repeat it)
They envy me, I'm MVP, this is my season
Creepin' in the Jeep, turn this bitch to Jeepers Creepers
(Jeepers Creepers)
Treat my bitch like a pistol, no such thing as keepers
These bitches throwaways, bust once, then I throw away
(Yeah aight)
I'm a fly Crip, baby, I don't know no other way (Scoop)
Ah-ha-ha (Bop)
On Schoolyard, bitch, yeah aight

[Chorus]
Pull up on your block, then I bleed it (Bleed it)
Slidin', if I don't drop somethin', I can't leave it (I can't leave it)
Wock' got me poured, but this TEC got him leanin' (Got him leanin')
Never let the beef get cold, where's the meetin'?
(Where's the meetin'?)
Pull up on your block, then I bleed it (Bleed it)
Slidin', if I don't drop somethin', I can't leave it (I can't leave it)
Wock' got me poured, but this TEC got him leanin' (Got him leanin')
Never let the beef get cold, where's the meetin'? (Where's the meetin'?)
