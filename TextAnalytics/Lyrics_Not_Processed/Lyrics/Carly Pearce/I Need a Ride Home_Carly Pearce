[Verse 1]
It ain't 3 a.m
And I ain't been drinking
But it's been one of those days
That's got my head spinning
I been rushing around till I'm dizzy
Feeling lonely in the crowd of the city
It ain't 3 a.m
And I ain't been drinking

[Chorus]
But I need a ride home
To that little town where I'll always be 16 years old
I need a two lane, can't pass, foot on the gas, go real slow
A little magic, little static on the radio
Mom and Daddy sitting on the front porch waving hello
Yeah I need a ride home

[Verse 2]
I wanna hear the click of that old transmission
I need a quick trip
Oh back to that table in the kitchen
I wanna see that little creek rushing
Right next to those fields full of nothing
I need a strong shot of something I've been missing

[Chorus]
Yeah I need a ride home
To that little town where I'll always be 16 years old
I need a two lane, can't pass, foot on the gas, go real slow
A little magic, little static on the radio
Mom and Daddy sitting on the front porch waving hello
Yeah I need a ride home

[Bridge]
It ain't 3 a.m
And I ain't been drinking
But it's been one of those days
That's got me thinking

[Chorus]
I need a ride home
To that little town where I'll always be 16 years old
I need a two lane, can't pass, foot on the the gas, go real slow
A little magic, little static on the radio
Mom and Daddy sitting on the front porch waving hello
Yeah let's go
I need a ride home
Oh I need a ride home
