[Verse 1]
Blame it on me, I'm an actor, I'm a fake
Blame it on me, I broke your heart, but by mistake
Call it what you wanna, good intentions or denial
But if I'm bein' honest, I've been lyin' for a while

[Chorus]
Halfway right doesn't make it right
Halfway wrong is still wrong
Half of me is with you here tonight
And half of me is long gone
You can try to tell a heart to feel somethin' that it don't
But halfway to Heaven isn't Heaven
And halfway home just ain't home

[Verse 2]
And I put it off, I was selfish, I was scared
I put it off and I know it isn't fair
No one wants to stay, but no one wants to say goodbye
Let's call it what it is and we'll get out of this alive

[Chorus]
Halfway right doesn't make it right
Halfway wrong is still wrong
Half of me is with you here tonight
And half of me is long gone
You can try to tell a heart to feel somethin' that it don't
But halfway to Heaven isn't Heaven
And halfway home just ain't home
Home

[Bridge]
And I'm sorry, if I hang on to you, I'll drown
I'm so sorry, if I don't let go, I'm goin' down

[Chorus]
Halfway right doesn't make it right
Halfway wrong is still wrong
Half of me didn't see it comin'
Half of me knew it all along
You can try to tell a heart to feel somethin' that it don't
But halfway to Heaven isn't Heaven
And halfway home just ain't home
Home
It ain't home
Home
