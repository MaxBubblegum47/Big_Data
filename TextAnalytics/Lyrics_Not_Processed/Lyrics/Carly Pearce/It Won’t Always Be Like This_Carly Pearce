[Verse 1]
I remember how I couldn't wait to get out of my hometown
Now I'm looking for every excuse to go back on the weekend
I can still see the front porch balcony
Every time I leave, Grandpa waving back at me
Wish I coulda told myself back then

[Chorus]
It won't always be like this
It won't always be like this
I know nothing lasts forever
But sometimes, I still forget
It won't always be like this

[Verse 2]
I remember hearing the door slam, twenty-two, didn't have a clue
Who I was or who I could trust and who were my real friends
I had big wings, but didn't have a sky, just a front row view
Of everybody flying high, waiting for my time
Wish I coulda told myself back then

[Chorus]
It won't always be like this
It won't always be like this
Know the heart won't ache forever
No matter how hard it gets
It won't always be like this, no

[Bridge]
Looking at you, looking back at me
All I wanna do is make another memory
And love you like it's the end

[Chorus]
'Cause it won't always be like this
It won't always be like this
No, it won't always be like this
I know it won't always be like this
I wish love would last forever
So I could live it all again
It won't always be like this
It won't always be like this
