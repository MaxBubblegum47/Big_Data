[Verse 1]
The scent that you left on my pillow
The sound of your heartbeat with mine
The look in your eyes like a window
The taste of your kiss soaked in wine

[Chorus]
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

[Verse 2]
Guess you forgot what you told me
Because you left my heart on the floor
Baby, your ghost still haunts me
But I don't want to sleep with him no more

[Chorus]
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Of every little thing

[Bridge]
They say time is the only healer
God, I hope that isn't right
Cause right now I'd die to not remember

[Chorus]
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing
I remember every little thing
I'm haunted by the memories of
Every little thing
The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting
Every little thing
