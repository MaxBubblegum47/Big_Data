[Verse]
It's alright if you love me
It's alright if you don't
I'm not afraid of you runnin' away honey
I get the feeling you won't
Say there ain't no sense in pretending
Your eyes give you away
Something inside you is feeling like I do
We said all there is to say

[Chorus]
Baby
Breakdown, go ahead and give it to me
Breakdown, honey, take me through the night
(Take me, baby, breakdown, ooh)
Breakdown, now I'm standin' here, can't you see?
Breakdown, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

[Chorus]
Breakdown, go ahead and give it to me
Breakdown, honey, take me through the night
(Take me, baby, breakdown, ooh)
Breakdown, now I'm standin' here, can't you see?
Breakdown, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
