[Intro]
M.A. on the track

[Chorus: WhoHeem]
I like you, I don't give a fuck 'bout your boyfriend
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands
Treat you like you monarchy, the we can slide out, touch bands
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands

[Verse 1: Lil Mosey]
Shawty do your dance and clap once
Baby, shake yo' ass and clap twice
Finna bring you back home, give you good pipe
Then I seen her boyfriend text her goodnight
Bitch you think that I care
I just wanna beat it up and pull hair
Just bounce that up baby, good air
She only tryna fuck with a millionaire
I'ma leave a lil' drip on your forehead
Then I find another one in the morning
I ain't tryna get a wife, that shit boring
You know I'm tryna fuck 'causе she foreign
Last time I fuckеd, I recorded off an iPhone
Said it's so good, she was singing all high notes
She get so lit, that's the side note
She gon' spit on this dick with her eyes closed

[Chorus: WhoHeem]
I like you, I don't give a fuck 'bout your boyfriend
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands
Treat you like you monarchy, the we can slide out, touch bands
Come on, with Heem, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands

[Verse 2: WhoHeem]
Prada baby, she a flocker
Don't let any nigga hit, so they call her a bopper
Can't no bitch top her
She got a squabble like a nigga, yeah, she get it from her father
Sex in the City girls
Nails done, lemon braids, they're so pretty, girl, ah
She don't be in any world
Wrong shoe, wrong fit, no Cinderella, girl
Car basic
Bro big mad it's not him that she chasin'
Two weeks, he couldn't find a replacement
He done lost a good bitch, downgraded to a basic
Lane switch
Bitch is lucky, call her sour folk 'cause she change
'Cause she don't care
Sold her nigga, won't offer it up, notched up
Turned off her pipe and then she bossed up
On any bitch head who got an issue
Mace a bitch up, tear your drawers, she might spit too
Messy, take your nigga if she want to
Give him pussy, got him stuck, he said I love you on the first day
You bitches couldn't see her on her worst day
Fly bitch like first day of school on her birthday
Ooh, she nasty, F-R-E-A-K

[Verse 3: Tyga]
I like you, I don't wanna fuck on your bestfriend
Let me give that lil' pussy lil' lessons
We can link, we can link with a text message
You ever been in a Ferrari?
Make a wish, I can do it to you
You a lil' bopper, got a little booty
And she wanna top me, don't spill the fluids
I'm a dog, move bitch, got a new bitch
Ain't Ludacris, but I tell her "Move, bitch"
I'm a motherfuckin' G, got ruthless
Press the button, make the car got roofless
Make it nasty, suck it like you toothless
Give a fuck 'bout a nigga, give two shits
New whip, new phone, bitch, who this?
OMG, bussin' like a grape, bitch, ooh
Ah, that's what I like, baby, that's what I like
F-R-E-A-K (A-K)
Lil' C-R-A-Z-Y, that's crazy
Ayy, go crazy (Go crazy)
Ayy, goddam (goddam)
Ayy, I killed it (I killed it)
Ayy, I'm done

[Chorus: WhoHeem]
I like you, I don't give a fuck 'bout your boyfriend
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands
Treat you like you monarchy, the we can slide out, touch bands
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands
Come on with Heem, come on with Heem (Ah)
Come on, let's link, come on, let's link (Ah)
I like you, I don't give a fuck 'bout your boyfriend
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands
