[Intro]
No, no, no, no, no love
Oh, I only want you

[Verse 1]
I don't want another night of tryna find
Another you, another rock bottom
I don't wanna wear another mini dress
To impress a potential problem
I don't wanna spend the night at someone's place
To fill the space that you used to walk in
I don't want another number in my phone
Someone to hold at three in the morning

[Chorus]
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just to need, just to need ya
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know I'm the one who ruined everything
And made you think that it was all your fault
And I know that sorry's only just a word
And when it hurts, it isn't that simple
But I know that if you look me in the eyes
You can't deny that we're something different
And I know I'm going looking for your kiss
On someone's lips to know that I miss ya

[Chorus]
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just to need, just to need ya
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh yeah-ayy, oh yeah-ayy
Oh yeah-ayy, oh yeah-ayy
Oh yeah-ayy, oh yeah-ayy
I don't want another night of tryna find
Another you, another rock bottom
I don't wanna wear another mini dress
To impress a potential problem

[Chorus]
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just to need, just to need ya
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah
