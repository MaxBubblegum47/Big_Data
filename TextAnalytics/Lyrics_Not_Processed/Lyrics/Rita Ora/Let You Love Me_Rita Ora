[Verse 1]
I should've stayed with you last night
Instead of going out to find trouble
That's just trouble (Mmm)
I think I run away sometimes
Whenever I get too vulnerable
That's not your fault (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I wanna stay the whole night
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up
I wanna let you inside
Oh, Heaven knows I've tried

[Chorus]
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Say what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me now
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I

[Verse 2]
And every time it gets too real
And every time I feel us sabotaging
I start running (Yeah, eh)
And every time I push away
I really wanna say that I'm sorry (Yeah)
But I say nothing (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I wanna stay the whole night
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up
I wanna let you inside
Oh, Heaven knows I've tried

[Chorus]
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Say what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me now
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I

[Bridge]
I wanna stay with you 'til the morning
I wanna lay with you through the sunrise
I wanna show you that you're my only
I wanna lay with you 'til the sun's up
I wanna stay with you 'til the morning
I wanna lay with you through the sunrise, through the sunrise
Oh-oh-oh-oh, Heaven knows I've tried

[Chorus]
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me (Me, yeah)
I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me
Say what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me now
Say what's the matter, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Oh, I wish that I could let you love
Wish that I could let you love me now
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I
Oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, oh, I wish, I
