[Verse 1: Rita Ora]
Baby, let's cut down the lights
I just really wanna let this fire burn bright
I'm just telling you to have an open mind
Just imagine us (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
You're taking me there, you're taking me there
Our lips are barely touching
So do it again, so do it again
We could be on to something

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
Hey, heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Hey, heyo, heyo, if you want it, then you got it, hold me
No more, no more wasting time
We can, we can go all night
Hey, heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
(Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)
Body on me
(Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)
Body on me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Put you up against the wall
And I'ma go to work 'til you get off
Baby, soon as you're done, we'll go some more, oh, oh
Girl, just imagine us

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & Chris Brown, 
Chris Brown
]
You're taking me there, you're taking me there
Our lips are barely touching (
Oh, oh, oh
)
So do it again, so do it again
We could be on to something (
Oh, oh
)

[Chorus: Rita Ora, 
Chris Brown
]
Hey, heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Hey, heyo, heyo, if you want it, then you got it, hold me
No more, no more wasting time
We can, we can go all night (Oh, oh, woah, all night)
Hey, heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me (
Your body
)
(Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)
Body on me (
Oh, oh, oh
)
(Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay) (
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Your body on me
(Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay) (Yeah, oh, oh)
Your body on me

I'm not asking for too much, 
put your fingertips on me
