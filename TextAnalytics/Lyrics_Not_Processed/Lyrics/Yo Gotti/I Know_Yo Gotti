[Intro]
Trauma Tone

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know (What you know, Quan?)
You ain’t that nigga you say you is (Well how you know though?)
Just know that I know, I know, I know (Okay!)
Them streets, they fuck with me strong
And them bitches gon fuck just because money long (Money long)
You know that I know, I know, I know
Boy you know that I know it, I know it, I know
You know I know what's up, yeah

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
You a fuck nigga and it ain’t a secret (Secret)
I’m so official, they can referee it (They know I am)
Black gun, white work, I got jungle fever (They know I do)
28 on the scale, all I drop is ether (Rich Homie)
Get money, break bread, gotta feed your people (People)
Every day like Thanksgiving, everybody eating (Beep)
I put work in the hood, let my homies grind (They grind)
I do what I do to see my niggas shine (Real nigga shit)
I know what I know and man that’s all I know (That's all I know)
I take 63 grams and try to make a four (Four)
That’s a couple ounces if I get it right
Wanna see my homies rich cause nigga this the life
I know

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I know, I know, I know (You know I know, nigga)
I know, I know, I know (What you know Quan?)
You ain’t that nigga you say you is (Well how you know though?)
Just know that I know, I know, I know (Okay!)
Them streets, they fuck with me strong
And them bitches gon fuck just because money long (Money long)
You know that I know, I know, I know
Boy you know that I know it, I know it, I know

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Hey, I know that you ain’t that nigga you claim to be (Nah)
Despite how much money that I make, this shit ain’t changing me
I know, I know, I know, a lot of these niggas, they lame to me
I’m blown, I smoke what I roll
Is with the same niggas that I came in with (Rich Homie baby)
I’m on the West Coast in a low rider (Hey)
Four bitches tryna leave with me
Ain’t enough room and I don’t know y'all
I’m high as fuck, you a low pilot
I got a pharmacy ho for them narcotics
Put a potato on it, make it shoot silent
Fuck wrong with you? You profiling
I done made a million dollars and I didn’t go to college (Fuck you mean)
And all my niggas get locked up for some work
Best believe he goin silent
He don’t know nobody, can’t trust nobody but yourself (Rich Homie)
So believe me when I tell you that I know about it
When I asked your ho about it, she said me and Yo Gotti
The realest niggas left and I told that bitch

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I know, I know, I know (You know I know, nigga)
I know, I know, I know (What you know Quan?)
You ain’t that nigga you say you is (Well how you know though?)
Just know that I know, I know, I know (Okay!)
Them streets, they fuck with me strong
And them bitches gon fuck just because money long (Money long)
You know that I know, I know, I know
Boy you know that I know it, I know it, I know

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
I wanna see my homies rich forever
I know some secrets, I’ll never tell em
I got some birds but I’d never mail em
You in love with Instagram hoes and you ain’t never met 'em
Ay, pocket full of money, boy I know the feeling
I know that niggas hatin' that's  why I lost the Civic
And the drophead, of the 71 cutlass on 8’s
Got my wife beater on with my hat to the back
Started from the bottom like Drake
But I’m with the same old niggas that I started with
Same young niggas I was robbing with
And if these niggas have a problem with it
Got them  automatic pistols no revolver shit (Bang!)
And I know niggas sell they soul, go against they guys
Fuck niggas, playin like they real, living in disguise
Homie what you know?

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I know, I know, I know (You know I know, nigga)
I know, I know, I know (What you know Quan?)
You ain’t that nigga you say you is (Well how you know though?)
Just know that I know, I know, I know (Okay!)
Them streets, they fuck with me strong
And them bitches gon fuck just because money long (Money long)
You know that I know, I know, I know
Boy you know that I know it, I know it, I know
