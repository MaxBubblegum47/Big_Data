[Chorus]
I seen your girl post her BM
So I hit her in her DM
All eyes, yeah I see ’em
Yeah, that's your man? I'd hate to be him (whoop)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go, down)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go, down)

[Verse 1]
I tell her, Snapchat me that pussy, mood
Or Facetime me that pussy if it's, cool (whoo)
Boy, my DM poppin' (DM poppin')
My DM just caught a body
I got celebs in this DM
They breakin' news if they see them
But nah we don't do no talkin' (we don't do no talkin')
We see sucker shit too often (fuck nigga)

[Chorus]
I seen your girl post her BM
So I hit her in her DM
All eyes, yeah I see ’em
Yeah, that's your man? I'd hate to be him (whoop)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go, down)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go, down)

[Verse 2]
Don't you hate when you get screenshotted? (petty)
Bitch that DM wasn't for everybody (rules)
I love the ’Gram, I love the ’Gram (I love the ’Gram)
I'm addicted to it, I know I am (I know I am)
And I just followed Angela (Simmons)
Boy, I got a crush on Angela Simmons
They like, "Damn Gotti, you bold"
Fuck it, I'ma let the world know (#goals)

[Chorus]
