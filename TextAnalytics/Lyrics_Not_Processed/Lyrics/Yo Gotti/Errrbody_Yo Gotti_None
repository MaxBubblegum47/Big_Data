Errbody on Instagram lookin like they mad rich but they not
Errbody say they started from the bottom now they at the top

[Verse 1]
Errbody say they they got haters
Errbody got paper guess ain't nobody broke
But who is me to talk about the next nigga out here flexin'
When I did it before
And who is you to talk about this whip ain't mine
But you see a nigga in it with the top down
Boy you sound like a hater on the front line

Errbody got some to say, errbody wanna hate
If ya ask me err'bitch gay, in the club dancing on her friend
Tryna pretend, when ya know you go both ways
Err'nigga think that shit cool, don't you be fooled

Tell ya eat her pussy then you can't be mad
Cause ya should've never gave me the wrong picture

Couple niggas ballin' in the club
Poppin' bottles buyin' booths but if a nigga wanna know the truth
Still owe the plug in that rented ass coupe
If his watch ain't real then his chain ain't too
Shawty gotta million some followers, a million some problems
But she a different person on the gram
Meet her in person, you like where all the purses
Thought you had errcolor, shawty yean got naan

Errbody smokin' on kush, if you smokin' on regular
