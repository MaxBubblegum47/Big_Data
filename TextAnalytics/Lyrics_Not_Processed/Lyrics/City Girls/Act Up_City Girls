Earl on the beat

[Verse 1: JT & 
Yung Miami
]
Real ass bitch, give a fuck 'bout a nigga
Big Birkin bag, hold five, six figures
Stripes on my ass so he call this pussy Tigger
Fuckin' on a scammin' ass, rich ass nigga
Same group of bitches, ain't no adding to the picture
Drop a couple racks, watch this ass get bigger
Drinkin' on liquor, and I'm lookin' at your nigga
If his money right, he can eat it like a Snicker
I ain't got time for you fake-ass hoes
Talkin' all loud in them fake-ass clothes
Fake ass shoes match that fake-ass gold
I'm the realest bitch ever to you snake-ass hoes

[Chorus: JT & Yung Miami]
Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Dirty ass nails, baby girl, you need to back up

[Verse 2: Yung Miami]
It's Yung Miami, and I came to run my sack up (Yup)
Tired-ass hoes on my page tryna track us (Ha)
Brand new chain, City Girls goin' platinum (Facts)
I keep a baby Glock, I ain't fightin' with no random, period (Period)
You bitches weak, is you serious? (Haha)
I let him taste the pussy, now he actin' all delirious (Ow)
Did the dash in the Rover like it's 
Fast and Furious
She see my number in his phone, now you actin' curious (Bitch)
He gon' buy me Gucci if I ask for it (Yup)
He a classy nigga rockin' Tom Ford (Classy)
I bet your lil' sister wanna look like me (Lil' bitch)
I bet your lil' brother wanna fuck on me
Hood bitch, good pussy, I ain't average, um
He can't come around without that cabbage, um (Nah)
Pop a pussy bitch quick, like a bubblegum
I ain't never worry, I just deal with it for fun

[Chorus: JT & Yung Miami]
Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Dirty ass nails, baby girl, you need to back up

[Verse 3: JT]
JT on the track, and you know I'm 'bout my paper
Pussy sweet, pussy tight, so he called it Lifesaver
If your ass a broke nigga, hell nah, I can't date ya
If your ass a rich nigga, I'ma fuck ya 'til you ain't one
If that nigga a scammer, I'm turnin' to a dancer (Yup)
I make it clap like he got the right answer
Sit on it with manners, get it harder than a hammer
He wanna freak, pussy pink, breast cancer
Oh, you like big butts, well I like big bucks
I don't care about your chain, nigga, or your big truck (Nah)
Yeah, I know you gettin' it, but is you spendin' it?
Give a fuck what a nigga got if he ain't givin' it
Ba-badass bitch, bad attitude (Yeah)
Nails done, hair done, ass too (Ow)
Your baby daddy fuckin' me and suckin' me
He don't answer you, bitch, that's because of me (Period)

[Chorus: JT & Yung Miami]
Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Dirty ass nails, baby girl, you need to back up
