Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at?
Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at?
Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at?
Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at? (uh)
Own crib, own car yeah you like that
Slick mouth, pussy great, yeah you like that
Bad bitch, cute face, yeah you like that
Don’t be surprised if I ask where the bag at

[Verse 1: Yung Miami]
He say he want a cutie with a booty (with a booty)
Who make him feel like Keisha did Gucci (Gucci)
Well meet me at Gucci, and let’s talk about it (huh?)
Bring your safe with your partner, don’t leave your home without it (yeah)
Spoil me like my daddy, you can fuck me 'til I’m raspy (raspy)
Money make me cum, feeling seats in my panties, yeah
Grab his dick and make him blush
Make him feel he can fuck (ooh!)
Gotta get it how I live, that’s a must
Pop the pussy on the dick and make it stand (make it stand)
I put it to the side for a Benz (for a Benz), yeah
You ain’t got enough to cuff this bitch
I want my money on time, nigga fuck that shit (nigga!)

[Chorus: Yung Miami & 
J.T.

Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at?
Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at?
Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at?
Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at? (uh)
Own crib, own car, yeah you like that
Slick mouth, pussy great, yeah you like that
Bad bitch, cute face, yeah you like that
Don’t be surprised if I ask where the bag at

[Verse 2: J.T.]
I need a nigga off the block who be spending it (uh-huh)
Cook crack, roll dice, and be killing shit (yup)
Ain’t scared to blow a bag on some fly shit
I don’t want no broke nigga with good dick (period)
If it don’t make money, it don’t make sense
That nigga ain’t had the money, he ain’t see me since (ha)
Hmm, what the fuck you niggas think this is?
I ain’t no petty ass bitch, play with your kids
I need a brand new crib just to fuck in
Two seater Benz coupe just to suck in
Five racks for the shoes just to club in
Maybe you can eat the pussy after lunch then
He want a bitch from the city, pussy good, titties pretty
Cook a meal, roll a Philly, pay a bill just to kiss me
Block your number, make you miss me
Drive you crazy, make you diss me
Wanna leave your bitch the playhouse
Motherfucker this ain’t Disney

[Chorus: Yung Miami & 
J.T.
]
Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at?
Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at?
Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at?
Where the bag at, nigga, where the bag at? (uh)
Own crib, own car, yeah you like that
Slick mouth, pussy great, yeah you like that
Bad bitch, cute face, yeah you like that
Don’t be surprised if I ask where the bag at
