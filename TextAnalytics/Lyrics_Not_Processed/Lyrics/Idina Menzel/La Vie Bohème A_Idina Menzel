[WAITER]
No, please no
Not tonight, please no
Mister, can't you go?
Not tonight, can't have a scene

[ROGER]
What?

[WAITER]
Go, please go
You, hello, sir!
I said no
Important customer

[MARK]
What am I, just a blur?

[WAITER]
You sit all night, you never buy!

[MARK]
That's a lie, that's a lie!
I had a tea the other day

[WAITER]
You couldn't pay

[MARK, spoken]
Oh yeah...

Our Akita

[BENNY, MARK, ANGEL, COLLINS]
Evita

[BENNY]
Mimi, I'm surprised
A bright and charming girl like you
Hangs out with these slackers
Who don't adhere to deals
They make fun, yet I'm the one
Attempting to do some good
Or do you really want a neighborhood
Where people piss on your stoop every night?
Bohemia
, 
Bohemia's
 a fallacy in your head
This is Calcutta
Bohemia is dead

[MARK]
Dearly beloved
We gather here to say our goodbyes

[COLLINS & ROGER]

Kyrie eleison
Yitgadal veyitkadash

[MARK]
Here she lies, no one knew her worth
The late great daughter of Mother Earth
On this night when we celebrate the birth
In that little town of Bethlehem
We raise our glass, 
you bet your ass
, to
La vie Bohème

[ALL]
La vie Bohème
La vie Bohème
La vie Bohème
La vie Bohème

[MARK]
To days of inspiration
Playing hooky
Making something out of nothing
The need to express
To communicate
To going against the grain
Going insane
Going mad
To loving tension, no pension
To more than one dimension
To starving for attention
Hating convention
Hating pretension
Not to mention, of course
Hating dear old Mom and Dad
To riding your bike
Midday past the 
three-piece suits
To fruits
To no absolutes
To Absolut
To 
choice
To The Village Voice
To any passing fad
To being an us, for once
Instead of a them

[ALL]
La vie Bohème
La vie Bohème

Don't give me that face

Ahem

[MAUREEN]
Hey, Mister
She's my sister

[WAITER]
So that's five miso soup
Four seaweed salad
Three soy burger dinner
Two tofu dog platter
And one pasta with meatless balls

[A BOY]
Ew

[COLLINS]
It tastes the same

[MIMI]
If you close your eyes

[WAITER]
And thirteen orders of fries
Is that it here?

[ALL]
Wine and beer!

[MIMI & ANGEL]
To hand-crafted beers made in local breweries
To yoga, to yogurt, to rice and beans and cheese
To leather, to dildos, to curry vindaloo
To huevos rancheros
 and 
Maya Angelou

[JOANNE]
Yes, Maureen

[MAUREEN]
Well, hurry back

[MARK, spoken]
Maureen Johnson, back from her spectacular one-night engagement at the eleventh street lot, will sing Native American tribal chants backwards through her vocoder, while accompanying herself on the electric cello, which she has never studied

[BENNY]
Your new boyfriend doesn't know about us

[MIMI]
There's nothing to know

[BENNY]
Don't you think that we should discuss --

[MIMI]
It was three months ago

[BENNY]
He doesn't act like he's with you

[MIMI]
We're taking it slow

[BENNY]
Where is he now?

[MIMI]
He's right -- Hmm

[BENNY]
Uh huh...

[MIMI]
Where'd he go?

And Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song

That doesn't remind us of "Musetta's Waltz"

[MIMI]
Excuse me, did I do something wrong?
I get invited, then ignored all night long

[ROGER]

No one's perfect, I've got baggage

[MIMI]
Life's too short, babe, time is flying
I'm looking for baggage that goes with mine
