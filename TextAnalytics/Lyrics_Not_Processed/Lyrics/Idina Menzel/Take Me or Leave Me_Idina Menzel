Every single day I walk down the street
I hear people say 'baby’s so sweet'
Ever since puberty
Everybody stares at me
Boys, girls, I can’t help it baby
So be kind
And don’t lose your mind
Just remember that I’m your baby

Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be
And if you give a damn
Take me, baby
Or leave me
Take me baby or leave me

A tiger in a cage can never see the sun
This diva needs her stage baby let’s have fun
You are the one I choose
Folks would kill to fill your shoes
You love the limelight too now baby
So be mine
And don’t waste my time
Crying oh honey bear are you still my my my baby (don’t you dare)

Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be
And if you give a damn
Take me baby or leave me

No way
Can I be what I’m not
But hey
Don’t you want your girl hot?
Don’t fight
Don’t lose you head
Cause every night who’s in your bed
Who?
Who’s in your bed
Kiss pookie

[JOANNE]
It won’t work
I look before I leap
I love margins and discipline
I make lists in my sleep baby
What’s my sin?
Never quit I follow through
I hate mess but I love you
What to do with my impromptu baby
So be wise
Cause this girl satisfies
You got a prize so don’t compromise
You’re one lucky baby

[JOANNE]
Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be
And if you give a damn
Take me baby or leave me
[MAUREEN]
Control freak
Snob yet over attentive
Lovable droll geek
Anal retentive
That’s it
The straw that breaks my back
I quit
Unless you take it back
Women, what is it about them?
Can’t live
With them or without them

Take me for what I am
Who I was meant to be (who I was meant to be)
And if you give a damn (and if you give a damn)
Take me baby (oh take me, baby)
Or leave me (take me or leave me)
Take me, baby
Or leave me

Guess I’m leaving
I’m gone
