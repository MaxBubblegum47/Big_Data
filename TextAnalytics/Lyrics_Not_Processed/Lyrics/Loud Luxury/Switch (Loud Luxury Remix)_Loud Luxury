[Intro: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Kick in the door, wavin' the four fizzy
They already know they can't fuck with Iggy
True's cost more than the rent do, you know that
All black on when I come through, it's Kodak
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Is Iggy the ziggy-iggy the baddest of 'em all?
Why you come through, shut down the mall?
All that ass deserve an applause

[Pre-Chorus: Anitta]
Change the game
Switchin' up the game
There I go again
Play your role, play you ro-o-ole
Fantasy
Turns reality
Right in front of me
I can have it anyway I want

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch!
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
Red light, yellow light, red light, yellow light
Red light, yellow light,  green light, switch
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
Red light, yellow light, red light, yellow light

[Break: Distorted Voice]
Red light, yellow light, red light, yellow light (switch)
Red light, yellow light (switch)
Red light, yellow light, red light, yellow light
Red light,  yellow light

[Pre-Chorus: Anitta]
Change the game
Switchin' up the game
There I go again
Play your role, play you ro-o-ole
Fantasy
Turns reality
Right in front of me
I can have it anyway I want

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
Red light, yellow light,  green light, switch
Red light, yellow light,  green light, switch
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
This is all that, this is all that, this is all that, this is all that
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get, switch
Red light, yellow light,  green light, switch
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
Red light, yellow light, red light, yellow light
Red light, yellow light,  green light, switch
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get

[Outro: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
Red light, yellow light, red light, yellow light (switch)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (uh)
