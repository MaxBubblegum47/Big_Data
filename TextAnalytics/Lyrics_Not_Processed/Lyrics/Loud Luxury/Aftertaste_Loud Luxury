[Intro]
Oh, oh, ah

[Verse 1]
You don’t know what you did to me, what you did to me
Sittin' all alone I forgot, I forgot the way that you’d say my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Why’d you keep me close enough to love you
And your heart stayed close, not what you wanted
Why’d you keep me close, just to let me go?

[Chorus]
Even though I kno-o-ow
That you’re really go-o-one
Crazy that I won’t give up on you (So I hold onto)
Should be movin' o-o-on
But you’re the one I wa-a-ant
Crazy that I won’t give up on you

[Drop]
So I hold onto your aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste oh
So I hold onto your aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste oh
So I hold onto your
Kno-o-ow
That you’re really go-o-one
Crazy that I won’t give up on you (So I hold onto)
Should be movin' o-o-on
But you’re the one I wa-a-ant
Crazy that I won’t give up on you

[Verse 2]
Lying in bed I can feel the space pillows can’t replace
Plans that we made, let them go, let them go to waste
They’re still haunting me

[Pre-Chorus]
Why’d you keep me close enough to love you
And your heart stayed close, not what you wanted
Why’d you keep me close just to let me go?

[Chorus]
Even though I kno-o-ow
That you’re really go-o-one
Crazy that I won’t give up on you (So I hold onto)
Should be movin' o-o-on
But you’re the one I wa-a-ant
Crazy that I won’t give up on you

[Pre-Drop]
So I hold onto your aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste, oh
So I hold onto your aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste, oh

[Drop]
Aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste, oh
So I hold onto your
Aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste
Ah-aftertaste, oh
So I hold onto your
Kno-o-ow
That you’re really go-o-one
Crazy that I won’t give up on you (So I hold onto)
Should be movin' o-o-on
But you’re the one I wa-a-ant
Crazy that I won’t give up on you

[Outro]
So I hold onto your
Even though I kno-o-ow
That you’re really go-o-one
Crazy that I won’t give up on you (So I hold onto)
Should be movin' o-o-on
But you’re the one I wa-a-ant
Crazy that I won’t give up on you
So I hold onto your
