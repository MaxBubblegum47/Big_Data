[Intro: Pitbull]
Jaja, everybody knows I'm live (Candela)
Everybody knows I'm five (Candela)
Go ahead and slip, I'll slide
All up in your B-O-D-Y

[Verse 1: brando]
Babe, don't make a sound
2 a.m. love gotta keep it down (Keep it down)
Don't wait around for a signal now
Gimme some verbs, I ain't talkin' nouns (I'm naughty)
You wanna ride in the Six
You wanna dine in the Six (Dine in the Six)
But when I lean for the kiss
You said I'll probably send you some pics
And I'm like

She got the body of a goddess
Booty so big, you can see it from the front

Baby, you exotic
Mami gotta be a chiropractor

Now gimme that
