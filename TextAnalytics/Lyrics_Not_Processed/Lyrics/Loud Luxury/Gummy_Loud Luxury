[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I've been moving too fast
Left my morals in the past
Not sure how we gon' last
Got my money doing laps
But it’s so hard
You look too good in my old car
Life's not fair take a selfie
Moonlit hair got me so weak

[Chorus]
In the backseat
Stretch around like a gummy
Most these girls tryna front me
Move too quick for the plan b (Oh ah)
Got me so hot
Whip so foreign need a 
green card
Life's not fair but it can be
Stretch around like a gummy

[Drop]
Ba dap dap ooh
Ba dap dap ooh
Life's not fair but it can be (Ooh)
Stretch around like a gummy (Oh ah)
Ba dap dap ooh
Ba dap dap ooh
Life's not fair but it can be (Ooh)
Stretch around like a gummy (Oh ah)

[Chorus]
In the backseat
Stretch around like a gummy
Most these girls tryna front me
Move too quick for the plan b (Oh ah)
Got me so hot
Whip so foreign need a 
green card
Life's not fair but it can be
Stretch around like a gummy

[Verse 2]
Think I’m movin' too slow
Kick all thoughts to the door
All your fear let it go
Watch it drop to the floor
Still is so hot
You look too good for the slow car
Life's not fair for a deadbeat
But right now I'm feelin' comfy

[Chorus]
In the backseat
Stretch around like a gummy
Most these girls tryna front me
Move too quick for the plan b (Oh ah)
Got me so hot
Whip so foreign need a 
green card
Life's not fair but it can be
Stretch around like a gummy (Oh ah)

[Drop]
Ba dap dap ooh
Ba dap dap ooh
Life's not fair but it can be (Ooh)
Stretch around like a gummy (Oh ah)
Ba dap dap ooh
Ba dap dap ooh
Life's not fair but it can be (Ooh)
Stretch around like a gummy
Ba dap dap ooh
Ba dap dap ooh
Life's not fair but it can be (Ooh)
Stretch around like a gummy (Oh ah)
Ba dap dap ooh
Ba dap dap ooh
Life's not fair but it can be (Ooh)
Stretch around like a gummy (Oh ah)

[Chorus]
In the backseat
Stretch around like a gummy
Most these girls tryna front me
Move too quick for the plan b (Oh ah)
Got me so hot
Whip so foreign need a 
green card
Life's not fair but it can be
Stretch around like a gummy (Oh ah)

[Outro]
Ba dap dap ooh
Ba dap dap ooh
Life's not fair but it can be (Ooh)
Stretch around like a gummy
Ba dap dap ooh
Ba dap dap ooh
Life's not fair but it can be (Ooh)
Stretch around like a gummy (Oh ah)
