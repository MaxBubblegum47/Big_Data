[Pre-Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
Three days in a row, we was faded (Faded)
Drinking out the bottle it's amazing (’Mazing)
Shawty love them hood niggas, can't fake it (Fake it)
I'm a hood nigga, can’t fake it

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
This girl getting loose (Getting loose)
Off the Goose (Off the Goose)
We gon' take a shot, call it salute (Salute)
Hanging with the crew, gotta keep the tool
If you want protection, I'ma show you what we do (What we do)

[Post-Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
You my medicine (You my medicine)
I call it heaven-sent (Call it heaven-sent)
And when I'm hitting it, I kill it, leave no evidence (Evidence)
You my medicine (You my medicine)
I call it heaven-sent (Call it heaven-sent)
Splashin' holy water on you, now I'm blessin' it (Wait, wait)

[Verse 1: Tyla Yaweh]
Back then, she dubbed me, she said I look dusty
Dripped down in fashion, now I look like money
Rolling Gelatto, are we staying stanky
Ride with the gang and they stay with the glizzy
And my ring is Versace, so bitch, kiss my pinky
Sipping so much lean, I'm losing my kidneys
We drink out the bottle, she get disrespectful
And when she on Xannies, she acting so cutthroat

[Pre-Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
Three days in a row, we was faded (Faded)
Drinking out the bottle it’s amazing (’Mazing)
Shawty love them hood niggas, can't fake it (Fake it)
I’m a hood nigga, can't fake it

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
This girl getting loose (Getting loose)
Off the Goose (Off the Goose)
We gon' take a shot, call it salute (Salute)
Hanging with the crew, gotta keep the tool
If you want protection, I'ma show you what we do (What we do)

[Post-Chorus: Tyla Yaweh & 
French Montana
]
You my medicine (You my medicine)
I call it heaven-sent (Call it heaven-sent)
And when I’m hitting it, I kill it, leave no evidence (
Haan
)
You my medicine (You my medicine)
I call it heaven-sent (Call it heaven-sent, 
Montana
)
Splashin' holy water on you, now I'm blessin' it

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Ayy, woke up with a craving
Some new whip, some new bitch
Give me something that's too quick
Shawty know that I'm too rich
Why they always get too attached?
A blessing and a curse, true, fact
Nice girls see the bad girls and the bad girls don't ever last (Haan)
French vanilla on the ice, moroccan and loving the spice
I see you want some advice, nothing is free, pay the price
He at the pool, fuck all the rules, sticking to me like she rice
She out here living her life, party tonight, fuck all the rules
Off Ciroc, ayy, taking back these shots, we don't stop
And that delion, they know what I'm on
Only burn that jet fuel, baby, if it's strong

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
This girl getting loose (Getting loose)
Off the Goose (Off the Goose)
We gon' take a shot, call it salute (Salute)
Hanging with the crew, gotta keep the tool
If you want protection, I'ma show you what we do (What we do)

[Post-Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
You my medicine (You my medicine)
I call it heaven-sent (Call it heaven-sent)
And when I'm hitting it, I kill it, leave no evidence (Evidence)
You my medicine (You my medicine)
I call it heaven-sent (Call it heaven-sent)
Splashin' holy water on you, now I'm blessin' it
