[Pre-Chorus]
Chase beating down the door
Beat around four
It's a go, lock and load, Glock with me
A bitch I throw away

[Chorus]
I just went through like four today
Fuck around, pour some more today
Who the young nigga putting on for the city
Hunnid pack, hunnid pack on the way
Like, ooh, guap, money
Talking 'bout, "Who shot Johnny?"
Made myself a boss so you can't run from me
Niggas sending shots so I send a couple hunnid
This that, ooh, guap, nigga
Still thuggin' like 2Pac, nigga

[Verse 1]
Plug on the soda
Ask what the turnaround is
You get it right back and it's coming ahora
I see them red and blue lights
And they screaming that Johnny got hit on the corner
It's sad they got him, wasn't no witnesses watching
I know that they plotting on me, I know that they plotting on me

[Post-Verse]
Yeah, twelve beating on the door looking for some witnesses
Ain't nobody tell 'em shit 'cause they know what the business is

[Pre-Chorus]
Chase beating down the door
Beat around four
It's a go, lock and load, Glock with me
A bitch I throw away

[Chorus]
I just went through like four today
Fuck around pour some more today
Who the young nigga putting on for the city
Hunnid pack, hunnid pack on the way
Like, ooh, guap, money (Ooh, guap)
Talking 'bout, "Who shot Johnny?" (Who shot Johnny?)
Made myself a boss so you can't run from me
Niggas sending shots so I send a couple hunnid
This that, ooh, guap, nigga (Ooh, guap, nigga)
Still thuggin' like 2Pac nigga (Thuggin' like 2Pac, nigga)

[Verse 2]
My 'migos just hit me like, "Andale"
Got a couple packs that's on the way
Tryna look out for the opps
Birds in the city, they all gotta drop
Screaming out, "Who shot Johnny?" (Who shot)
Off them drugs and money (Money)
Cutthroat niggas ain't got time to play
They hit a nigga with the nine today

[Post-Verse]
Yeah, twelve beating on the door looking for some witnesses
Ain't nobody tell 'em shit 'cause they know what the business is

[Pre-Chorus]
Chase beating down the door
Beat around four
It's a go, lock and load, Glock with me
A bitch I throw away

[Chorus]
I just went through like four today
Fuck around pour some more today
Who the young nigga putting on for the city
Hunnid pack, hunnid pack on the way
Like, ooh, guap, money (Ooh, guap)
Talking 'bout, "Who shot Johnny?" (Who shot Johnny?)
Made myself a boss so you can't run from me
Niggas sending shots so I send a couple hunnid
This that, ooh, guap, nigga (Ooh, guap, nigga)
Still thuggin' like 2Pac nigga (Thuggin' like 2Pac, nigga)
