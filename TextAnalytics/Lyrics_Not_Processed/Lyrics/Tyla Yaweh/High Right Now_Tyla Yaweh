[Chorus]
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down
'Cause this feels better to me
Than anybody reality
I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless
Flying on a cocaine spaceship
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I took
All I know is that I'm hooked
24 hours got me seeing blue dragons
Molly and the Henny got me speaking different language
Thinking 'bout the world now my mind, no tragic
Thinking 'bout the world now my mind, no tragic

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down
'Cause this feels better to me
Than anybody reality
I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless
Flying on a cocaine spaceship
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

[Verse 2]
I don't know where I am
My time's frozen and I can't comprehend
Can you stop? Quit fronting on me
I'ma stretch her back like a limousine
Everybody love me, tryna surf my wave
On designer drugs, can't feel my face

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down
'Cause this feels better to me
Than anybody reality
I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless
Flying on a cocaine spaceship
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

[Outro]
Yeah, I don't think that I'll ever come down
Yeah, I don't think that I'll ever come down, yeah
Yeah, I don't think that I'll ever come down
I don't think I'll ever come down
