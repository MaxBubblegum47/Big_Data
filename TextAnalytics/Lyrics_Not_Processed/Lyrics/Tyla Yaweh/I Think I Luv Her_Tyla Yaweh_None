Cash Money AP
Hitmaka
Right now, sound

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
Oh, she walkin' like a lick when she wobble it
I think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it
Oh, I'm walkin' with a stick like I'm moppin' it
Two-tone on the tick, ain't no toppin' it
Oh, she walkin' like a lick when she wobble it
I think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it
Oh, I'm walkin' with a stick like I'm moppin' it
Two-tone on the tick, ain't no toppin' it

[Verse 1: Tyla Yaweh]
Caught up in crazy girls with my side chick (Side)
Playing so stupid, like, "That's not my bitch" (Slatt, slatt)
Two-tone on my wrist look like I'm so rich (I'm rich)
Your pockets so dry look like a cactus
She got a ass, ass, ass spending my last, wait
I need the cash, cash, take it out the ATM
Call my business manager, she need to change my PIN
Gave it to a little baddie, now she going ham

[Break: Tyla Yaweh]
Wet pack on me, racks get lonely
Niggas wanna see my baguettes, they know they glow, ayy
Brand new Lambo, pink flamingo
Hop inside that bitch, I hit the floor and then I'm gone, wait

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
Oh, she walkin' like a lick when she wobble it (When she wobble it)
I think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it (When she poppin' it)
Oh, I'm walkin' with a stick like I'm moppin' it (I'm moppin' it)
Two-tone on the tick, ain't no toppin' it (Wait)
Oh, she walkin' like a lick when she wobble it (When she wobble it)
I think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it (When she poppin' it)
Oh, I'm walkin' with a stick like I'm moppin' it (I'm moppin' it)
Two-tone on the tick, ain't no toppin' it (Wait)

[Verse 2: YG]
Ayy, ayy
Like I'm moppin' it (Moppin' it)
She be wet and she be sticky, and she be topping it (She be topping' it)
Bitch we really do this fly shit, so I'm popping it (So I'm popping it)
I gave baby girl free game, that's a scholarship (That's a scholarship)
If I whip the dick out right now, is you driving it? (Ooh)
Ayy, all they life niggas throwing shade
Bust down my Cartier frames
Oh my God, I'm ashamed
Ayy, I make a pretty bitch tatt my name
Her friends like, "Oh my God, you're insane" (You're insane, bitch)
It go voom voom in a Lambo (In a Lambo)
I do my two step, my diamonds dance though (My diamonds dance, hoe)
Baby, how you in the club with some shell toes? (Some shell toes)
Upgrade you to some Prada pumps, hello

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
Oh, she walkin' like a lick when she wobble it (When she wobble it)
I think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it (When she poppin' it)
Oh, I'm walkin' with a stick like I'm moppin' it (I'm moppin' it)
Two-tone on the tick, ain't no toppin' it (Wait)
Oh, she walkin' like a lick when she wobble it (When she wobble it)
I think I love that bitch when she really poppin' it (When she poppin' it)
Oh, I'm walkin' with a stick like I'm moppin' it (I'm moppin' it)
Two-tone on the tick, ain't no toppin' it (Wait)
