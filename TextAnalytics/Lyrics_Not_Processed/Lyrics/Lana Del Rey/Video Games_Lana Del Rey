[Verse 1]
Swinging in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Whistlin' my name
Open up a beer and you say, "Get over here"
And play a video game
I'm in his favorite sundress, 
watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say, "You da bestest," lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
"Go play your video game"

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey—is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody
Is loving you
And baby, now, you do

[Verse 2]
Singing in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey—is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody
Is loving you
And baby, now, you do

[Post-Chorus]
(Now—now, you do, now, you do, now, you do)
(Now—now, you do, now, you do, now, you do)

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey—is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody
Is loving you
And baby, now, you do

[Post-Chorus]
(Now—now, you do, now, you do, now, you do) Mmmm, mmmmmm
Now, you do
(Now—now, you do, now, you do, now, you do)
