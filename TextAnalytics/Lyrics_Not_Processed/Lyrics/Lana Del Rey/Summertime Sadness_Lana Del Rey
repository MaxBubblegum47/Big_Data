[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Verse 1]
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the mornin' sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive, drive, drive

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
