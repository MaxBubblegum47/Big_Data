[Verse 1]
I know it ain't all that late
But you should probably leave
I recognize that look in your eyes
Yeah, you should probably leave

[Chorus]
'Cause I know you and you know me
And we both know where this is gonna lead
You want me to say that I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah, you should probably leave

[Verse 2]
There's still time for you to finish your wine
Then you should probably leave
And it's hard to resist, alright, just one kiss
Then you should probably leave

[Chorus]
'Cause I know you and you know me
And we both know where this is gonna lead
You want me to say that I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah, you should probably leave

[Bridge]
Like a devil on my shoulder you keep whisperin' in my ear
And it's gettin' kinda hard for me to do the right thing here
I wanna do the right thing, baby

[Verse 3]
Sun on your skin, 6AM
And I been watchin' you sleep
And honey, I'm so afraid you're gonna wake up and say
That you should probably leave

[Chorus]
'Cause I know you and you know me
And we both know where this is gonna lead
I want you to stay but you'll probably say
That you should probably leave
Yeah, you should probably leave
Oh, you should probably leave
