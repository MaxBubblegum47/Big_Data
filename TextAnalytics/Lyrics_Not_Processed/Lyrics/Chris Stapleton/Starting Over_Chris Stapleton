[Verse 1]
Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand
And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

[Chorus]
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny, you can be my four-leaf clover
Starting over

[Verse 2]
This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

[Chorus]
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny, you can be my four-leaf clover
Starting over
Starting over

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny, you can be my four-leaf clover
Starting over
Starting over
Oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
