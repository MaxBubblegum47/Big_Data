[Intro]
Take your heart, don't let me break it in two
I'm sure that I could possibly do nothin' for you
I'm nearly on the edge, I'm 'bout to jump in a few
I'm really not afraid of nothin'

[Verse 1]
Look, on everything
I gave everything and got nothing back
Ain't looking for no pat on backs
That ain't how we got where the fuck we at
Mama called, "Where the fuck you at?"
"On the road, and I ain't coming back
Until my hundred stacks make a hundred racks
And that hundred racks bring a bundle back"
I was blowin' gas like the Honey Badger
J.I.D, bitch, the money snatcher
C'est la vie, shit, I'm coming after everybody
Don't get the bloody splatter
I'm fly and I got my niggas fly too
Shit is like buddy passes
I wanna cry 'cause I'm numb inside (Ugh)
If you wonder why, ask, "What's the matter?" (Yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out, shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out

[Interlude]
Quiet, don't explain
What is there to gain

[Verse 2]
Shit, shit ain't really working out, huh
Now I got a little bread, got my niggas working outta town
Baby, your ass fat, I can see you working out, shit
And you got a new job? Tell me, how that shit working out? Heh
Heard you doing pretty good, yeah, people talk, word of mouth
Wasn't 'round when you had the dirty house
Now they won't leave when you kick 'em out
These type of people can't stick around
Only down when there's liquor 'round or the spliff around
That's why I don't fuck with niggas now
Well, I fuck with all my niggas, you know the difference
You been living with tunnel vision
You and all of your friends are like wonder women
Wonder Woman working for it, if you ever wanted something
Searching for a purpose, I see what you on
The difference in how you be using your gifts
In the midst of the shit that you dealing with
Really specific, you paid attention, panoramic
You got the vision like a fer-de-lance
You attack and you kill it, sinkin' your teeth with the venom
Kinda like me with these instrumentals
Or the pen and the pencil or off the temple
Pimpin' since been pimpin', keep it sensible
Since you winning, you a object of ridicule
Objects appearing closer than you ready for
Obviously, you don't know what's ahead
But that's the reason you can work 'til you dead

[Chorus]
I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out, shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out

[Outro: Zack Fox]
C'mon, bruh, come to the booty club one time
Throw some of that Dreamville money
Throw some of that Dreamville money at these hoes, bruh
They got dreams too, nigga
They got shit to do too, nigga
They got dreams too, bruh-bruh
Y'all Dreamville, uh, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, uh-uh
Next time you see that nigga J. Cole, bruh
You tell that nigga the same thing, man
I fuck with y'all niggas, bro
Why that nigga J. Cole, got all this money
Look like he 'bout to borrow somebody charger or something
"C'mon, bruh, let me get your charger, bruh
Let me get my shit to uh, uh, ten percent
And I'll give that shit back to you, bruh bruh"
C'mon, bruh, flex some of that Dreamville money, let me see it
