[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
I got the whole block bumpin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Na na na na now now, you know what this is
Tell 'em it's a celebration, bitches
With the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes
Mini-skirts, Hennessy's, and the Miller Lites
Domino tables, who got big 6?
Where I'm from we do concrete backflips
Flip flop, flip flop, flip flop back
To the ghetto's where I bring hip hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me "Keep it pushin'!"
The only niggas speak from way inside Central Bookings
County jails and the lock downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch
That's how they feel, Jack, built much more than rap
This that project haircut in the cul-de-sac
This is where Jose front you them quarters at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
I got the whole block bumpin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
From Compton to Baltimore I'ma kill it
I buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted
The air conditioner broke
But I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo
(Huh?) And I peel off
In the midst of gettin' my thrills off
And I thrive off energies from inner cities that we lost (huh?)
I'm puttin' the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Hear the siren, walk up, [pow pow] drive-by
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
The engines on back of scooters
The real can recognize real
And we need to know just who you are
You are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick the gift for the future, oh yeah, I said it
Thug life, good kid, mad city
Mad respect representin' the hub right

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
I got the whole block bumpin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
The home girls tell me I'm the shit
I break 'em off so they can buy some outfits
I buy they sons a pack of pampers, some new Jordan's
Give 'em the game, school 'em on what's really important
It's how I was raised, the OG's had me
Thirteen, fresh off the porch, slangin' cavi
But I'm wiser now, show all my young niggas
There's other ways you get them dollars and funds, nigga
Comin' down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fire ball; call it Goku
You don't know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers, I'ma show you
I paint the picture so perfect
In my CD, you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hunnit beat
Got my Crips and esse's at arm reach; one West

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
I got the whole block bumpin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
