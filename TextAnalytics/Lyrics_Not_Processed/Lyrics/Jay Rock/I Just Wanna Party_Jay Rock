[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool (No)
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool (Oh)
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the streets (Streets)
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me (Ugh)
But I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I’ll beat the fuck out of a nigga, why you bullshittin'?

[Verse 1: YG]
I'm drunk off Hennessy, hope I don't run into my enemies
That dark liquor give you energy
Now I ain't rich, but I'm finna be
Your baby mama's a flip, she wanna hit a G (Aww, shit!)
I'm back on that bullshit
If she ain't fucking, then that's bullshit
I can't die, I got too much to live for
I'm getting money, that's what niggas rob and kill for
Fucking with Tenisha and Keisha
But when Keisha see Tenisha, she gon' whoop her ass, ugh
All my homies gangbangers
They dry their clothes on hangers, ugh
All these hoes fucking, but they don't wanna seem like a ho
So you gotta hit 'em on the low (Hit 'em on the D-low!)
Westside, get-money gang
Socked him out for tripping, he lost his watch and his earrings

[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool (No)
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool (Oh)
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the streets (Streets)
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me (Ugh)
But I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I’ll beat the fuck out of a nigga, why you bullshittin'?

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Nigga, I'm from Hoover Street (Yeah, yeah)
Dirty pictures in my cellphone (Ugh, nigga)
On 52nd Street, I'm well-known (Groove)
Hoover stomping 'til the cops come (Yeah)
Silver satin get the job done (Ooh)
Money ain't everything, but still I'm rich (Okay)
Money ain't everything, I'm still gon' grift (Figg side!)
From Figueroa to Harv Side where we sock on lips (Ugh!)
We break on jaws, niggas since VCR's, nigga (Bitch-ass nigga)
We hop out cars, nigga (Nigga!)
I be groovin' 'til I die (Die), smokin' weed until I'm fried (Ohh)
I could sell a key to God (Ooh, ooh)
Pants saggin' with the Glock, I ain't wanna pick the box, ugh
(Yeah, ugh) All my homies gangbangers (Gangbangin')
We keep a thumb between our two fingers, mm!
We trippin' off the Henny
So don't let me catch you slippin' in the 50s; Ricky

[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool (No)
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool (Oh)
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the streets (Streets)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
It's Rock! Nigga, I'm from Bounty Hunters, East Side lunatic
Gangbang, step a bitch, I ain't with the extras
I ain't got a stunt double
You ain't got no hands, so they might let the gun touch you
Is you banging or you balling, nigga?
You a fax machine—we can't call it, nigga
Everybody ain't a friend, reason why I keep a four?
You wanna gamble with your life?
Bet that on the ten or four, nigga!
She bouncing that ass, go 'head, shake it
And if she give me that back, bitch, I'ma break it
Yeah, that pussy is overrated, some niggas'll chase it
She acting like she be nuttin', some bitches'll fake it
You fighting and saving these hoes, know that you losing
These bitches the reason why some niggas be snoozing
YG, dawg, you heard how they left his brains hanging?
Shouldn't have chunked them fingers up if he ain't banging
I'm saying!

[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool (No)
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool (Oh)
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the streets (Streets)
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me (Ugh)
But I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody

[Outro: Suga Free]
But I'll beat the fuck out of a bitch, why you bullshittin'?!
