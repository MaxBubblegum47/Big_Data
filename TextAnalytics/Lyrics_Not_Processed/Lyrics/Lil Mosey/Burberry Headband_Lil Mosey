[Intro]
Ayy, Royce, you did it right here
Skrtt, skrtt
Skrtt, skrtt
Ahhh, yah

[Chorus]
Pulled up in a Bimmer, I was flexin' (Skrtt, skrtt)
Poured a cup of Wock' 'cause I was stressin' (I was stressin')
After you, I'm fuckin' on your best friend (Lil'' bitch)
She love me, she see Burberry my headband (On my headband)
Put on all my ice, now I feel so cool (I feel so cool)
You worry 'bout a nigga like a ho do (Like a ho do)
I never chase a bitch, I thought I told you (Never that)
I just chase the money like I'm 'posed to (Like I'm 'posed to)

[Verse 1]
Pull up, I was flexing out a Bimmer (Out a Bimmer)
Prolly why you mad 'cause my shit cleaner (Bitch)
Running to the bands like a competer (Like a huh?)
Fuck her 'til the mornin' then I leave her (Then I leave her)
Don't address me, you is a broke nigga, ayy
I don't wanna see you at my show nigga, ayy (At my show nigga)
She wanna text me, she must throw throat, ayy (Throw throat, ayy)
But first impress me, bitch, bring me dough, aye

[Chorus]
Pulled up in a Bimmer, I was flexin' (Skrtt, skrtt)
Poured a cup of Wock' 'cause I was stressin' (I was stressin')
After you, I'm fucking on your best friend (Lil'' bitch)
She love me, she see Burberry my headband (On my headband)
Put on all my ice now I feel so cool (I feel so cool)
You worry 'bout a nigga like a ho do (Like a ho do)
I never chase a bitch, I thought I told you (Never that)
I just chase the money like I'm 'posed to (Like I'm 'posed to)

[Verse 2]
All these niggas asking, "How I do that?" (How I do that?)
They say I been drippin', I been knew that (I been drippin')
And when I say your name they asking, "Who dat?" (Who dat?)
And I just got a check and went and blew that (Went and blew that)
Lil' baby, why you lyin'? You don't fuck wit' me (Fuck wit' me)
You just want these bands that's why you stuck to me (Why you stuck to me)
I just got a fo' and I just poured the lean (I just poured the lean)
I just cracked a 'Wood and I just roll the gas

[Chorus]
Pulled up in a Bimmer, I was flexin' (Skrtt, skrtt)
Poured a cup of Wock' 'cause I was stressin' (I was stressin')
After you, I'm fucking on your best friend (Lil' bitch)
She love me, she see Burberry my headband (On my headband)
Put on all my ice now I feel so cool (I feel so cool)
You worry 'bout a nigga like a ho do (Like a ho do)
I never chase a bitch, I thought I told you (Never that)
I just chase the money like I'm 'posed to (Like I'm 'posed to)
