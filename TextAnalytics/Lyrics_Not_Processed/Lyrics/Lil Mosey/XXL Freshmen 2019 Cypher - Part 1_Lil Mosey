Verse 1: Lil Mosey

Goddamn, I feel like the man
Freshman of the year, I woke up like the man
Never poppin' Xans, 'cause they killin' me, damn
When you got the money, they be tryin' be your friend
Okay, this a lame-ass beat
Walk up on your bitch, my dick eight feet deep
Why he talking out his lip? He know ain't shit sweet
Ayy, ayy, your block I'm gon' sweep
Ayy, ayy, bussdown, not regular face (
What?
)
Ayy, chasin' blues like DaBaby (
What?
)
Ayy, swervin 'round with cake (
What?
)
Ayy, dropped out, no, I didn't graduate, man

[Interlude 1: Megan Thee Stallion]
Real hot girl shit, aah

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Bitch, I'm with your man, tryna see what the hit for
Post a new pic for a bitch I'ma shit on
Big bag talk, make that little money get gone
I love cash, I be in the back, tryna get it on
I'm gettin' money, I ain't even mad atcha'
Rich bitch shit, I might throw a bag atcha'
Speakin' on my name only make it sound better
Your nigga in my DM, and he write love-letters
Say that booty looking softer than Hawaiian rolls
I be in the gym, I'm your girls' body-goals
Flexin' on the gram do it for the mad hoes
Everything I do they watchin' me like I'm on parole
Couple of these bitches niggas on my block list
Drop a screenshot if I wanna start shit
I ain't fucked your man, that ain't how I rock sis'
I just took him to the bank to make a deposit, aah

[Interlude 2: YK Osiris]
Mmm-mmm, yeah-yeah, mmm

[Verse 3: YK Osiris]
She see body, when she lookin' at a young nigga
I fuck her good, now she talk about a young nigga
And I don't understand these bitches, why they like me
I put it in, now she wanna act so feisty
Now she say she worth it, but she ain't worth it
I put them diamonds on my wrist, and now she want me
I swear you niggas always lookin' like y'all know me
I put them diamonds on my neck, and now they want it
And now she wanna get it right now
And I'ma let her go for right now
And when she talkin' 'bout she 'bout it, she ain't 'bout it
And when I'm 'bout it, she ain't 'bout it, mmm, 'bout it, mmm, yeah-yeah

[Verse 4: DaBaby]
Everybody know my name
Ringin' bell, ringin' bell like the hallway
I ain't gotta cap in no motherfucking rap
I whip out and air it out broad day
I got in with the stick, and I'm with that
Break a nigga in half like a Kit-Kat
I been tryna' be positive mama
They ain't fuckin' wit' Jonathan, mama
Who you know put they motherfuckin' self on the map
And now they don't owe nobody shit
I send one of my lil' niggas, come take you off
You get laid on the floor by a jit
Got pulled over with 55K in my pocket
The police they know I'm legit
The police they know I got sticks
They be worried about me, they know I'ma click
These niggas they know I'm a dawg, I ain't worried about him
I know he a bitch
The next nigga that come play with me
I'ma send him to go ask 2Pac for a pic
They say I'm the hottest new nigga
Go check the thermometer, that nigga sick
Nigga must have a fever or somethin'
Heard he was born up on Cleveland or somethin'
Let me give you a history lesson
We moved back to Charlotte, 1999
I ain't sayin that none of that matter
If somebody touch me, then somebody die
Why he talkin' so calm when he say that?
How you make him rewind and replay that?
Who you know get a fade once a week
And ain't tryna get waves, fuck a motherfuckin' wave-cap
Everytime that the DJ play "Suge"
Niggas throw up they arm like a motherfuckin' racetrack
Everytime that my babygirl see me, she run
And say "Daddy", I love when she say that
Everytime I hit one of my moves, all the bitches go crazy
They like how I do that
I keep one in the head, if I don't let off first
I'ma dive to the side when I shoot back
Yeah, I'm comin' like Blade in this bitch
Fuck around, and walked down in a trenchcoat
They gon' have to put me with the greats
Wanna fuck with me, she gotta wait
On a yacht, with Mimi and the kids
There's four of us, we're on the sea eatin' steak
I ain't goin' ooh-ooh on a bitch
I ain't goin out sad 'bout no ho, I'm a pimp
He keep bumpin' his motherfuckin' gums
We gon put his ass up like a motherfuckin' blimp
Like to talk on the pillow wit' hoes' that's gon' get him
Exposed, he a muhfuckin simp
You know he keep that thang on him baby
Quit askin' him why that boy walk with a limp
I 'on't care bout this motherfuckin' chain
But I still bust your motherfuckin' brain
Just got head on a motherfucking plane
Ain't no cap in my rap, I'm the truth
End up fuckin' yo' hoe from the back
I knew hoe for a day, she won't ghost, she the swoup
And these niggas ain't livin like that, why he talkin' so gangsta?
Your boy, he a fluke
They know Baby gon' blow, he a flute
They know Baby gon' blow, he the bomb
They know Baby was just in Miami
Now he in LA, nigga think he LeBron
They know Baby go baby on baby
But five years ago, niggas say he was Jon
I touch down at the front of the plane
And the driver come pick up my Louis Vuitton
While he drive me around, I be blowin' out pressure
I'm chillin' backseat with the iron
