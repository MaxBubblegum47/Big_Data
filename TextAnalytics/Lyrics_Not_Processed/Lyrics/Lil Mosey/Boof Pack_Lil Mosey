[Intro]
Ayy Royce, you did it right here

[Chorus]
Smokin' boof pack
I just dropped the roof back (Skrrt skrrt)
In my own crib when they ask me where the stu' at (In the crib, ayy)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that
(We gon' shoot that)
And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ayy
(Bought that coupe, ayy)
Smokin' boof pack
I just dropped the roof back (Skrrt skrrt)
In my own crib when they ask me where the stu' at (In the crib, ayy)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that
(We gon' shoot that)
And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ayy
(Bought that coupe, ayy)

[Verse 1]
I drop the roof back
Young nigga flexin' how we do it, ayy (How we do it)
Bitches love a nigga but it's cool 'cause I've been doin' things
And you niggas hoes, tryna act like you gon' shoot, ayy (Know you won't)
I been with the bros, sippin' lean, and we cool, ayy (Sippin' lean)
If we see you walkin' and we see some fits we takin' (Yeah we takin')
I got Polo drop, and it's wrapped around my waist, yeah
Niggas switchin' up, got me askin' why you fake me
We just bought a crib, and we smokin' on it lately

[Chorus]
Smokin' boof pack
I just dropped the roof back (Skrrt skrrt)
In my own crib when they ask me where the stu' at (In the crib, ayy)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that

And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ayy
(Bought that coupe, ayy)
Smokin' boof pack
I just dropped the roof back (Skrrt skrrt)
In my own crib when they ask me where the stu' at (In the crib, ayy)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that
(We gon' shoot that)
And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ayy
(Bought that coupe, ayy)

[Verse 2]
I'm too busy runnin' up these bands (Runnin' up the bands)
I'm with yo ho and we don't hold no hands (Lil' bitch)
And I just dropped some lean, on my pants (Dropped some lean)
And we just dropped the clip and made 'em dance (Boom boom)
Bandkids love to ball we always cash out (Always cash out)
And I just faced a 'Wood, I'm 'bouta pass out (I'm 'bouta pass out)
And I just seen a lick, we bout to max out  ('Bouta max out)
Since a younginâ€™, started flexin', find the cash route

[Chorus]
Smokin' boof pack
I just dropped the roof back (Skrrt skrrt)
In my own crib when they ask me where the stu' at (In the crib, ayy)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that
(We gon' shoot that)
And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ayy
(Bought that coupe, ayy)
Smokin' boof pack
I just dropped the roof back (Skrrt skrrt)
In my own crib when they ask me where the stu' at (In the crib, ayy)
And you know we droppin' so don't ask if we gon' shoot that
(We gon' shoot that)
And I'm gettin' rich, young nigga bought that coupe, ayy
(Bought that coupe, ayy)
