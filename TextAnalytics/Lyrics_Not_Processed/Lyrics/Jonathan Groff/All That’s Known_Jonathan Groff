...litora, multum ille et terris iactatus et alto
Vi superum, saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram
Multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem
Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
Italiam fato profugus Laviniaque venit...

All that's known in History, in Science
Overthrown at school, at home, by blind men
You doubt them, and soon they bark and hound you
'Til everything you say is just another bad about you

[BOYS, chanted]
...litora, multum ille et terris iactatus et alto
Vi superum, saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram
Multa quoque et bello

All they say is "trust in what is written."
Wars are made, and somehow that is wisdom
Thought is suspect, and money is their idol
And nothing is okay unless it's scripted in their Bible
But I know there's so much more to find
Just in looking through myself, and not at them
Still, I know to trust my own true mind
And to say, "There's a way through this..."

[BOYS, chanted]
...ille et terris iactatus et alto
Vi superum, saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram
Multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem
Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
Italiam fato profugus Laviniaque venit...
...litora, multum ille et terris iactatus et alto
Vi superum, saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram
Multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem...

On I go, to wonder and to learning
Name the stars and know their dark returning
I'm calling, to know the world's true yearning
The hunger that a child feels for everything they're shown
You watch me
Just watch me
I'm calling, and one day all will know
You watch me
Just watch me
I'm calling
I'm calling, and one day all will know
