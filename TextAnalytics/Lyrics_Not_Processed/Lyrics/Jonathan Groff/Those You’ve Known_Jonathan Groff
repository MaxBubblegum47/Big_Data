[MORITZ]
Those you’ve known
And lost still walk behind you
All alone
They linger till they find you
Without them
The world grows dark around you
And nothing is the same
Until you know that they have found you

[WENDLA]
Those you’ve pained
May carry that still with them
All the same
They whisper 
"All forgiven"
Still your heart says
The shadows bring the starlight
And everything you’ve ever been
Is still there in the dark night

[MORITZ]
Though you know
You’ve left them far behind
You walk on by yourself
And not with them
Still you know
They will fill
Your heart and mind
When they say
There’s a way through this

[WENDLA]
When the northern
Wind blows
The sorrows
Your heart holds
There are those
Who still know
 
They’re still home
 
We’re still home

[MELCHIOR, MORITZ & WENDLA]
Those you’ve known
And lost still walk behind you
All alone
Their song still seems to find you
They call you
As if you knew their longing
They whistle through the lonely wind
The long blue shadows falling

[MELCHIOR]
All alone
But still I hear their yearning
Through the dark
The moon, alone there, burning
The stars too
They tell of 
spring returning
And summer with another wind
That no one yet has known
 
They call me
Through all things
 
Night’s falling
But somehow on I go
You watch me
Just watch me
 
I’m calling
 
From longing

[WENDLA]
When the northern
Wind blows
The sorrows your heart’s known
 
I believe
’
 
We're still home
 
We're still home

[MORITZ]
Though you know
There’s so much more to find
Another dream, another love you’ll hold
Still you know
To trust your own true mind
On your way you are not alone

[MELCHIOR]
Now they’ll walk on my arm through the distant night
And I won’t let them stray from my heart
Through the wind, through the dark, through the winter light
I will read all their dreams to the stars
I'll walk now with them
I’ll call on their names
And I’ll see their thoughts are known
Not gone
Not gone
They walk with my heart
 
And I'll never let them go
 
I’ll never let them go
 
I’ll never let them go

[WENDLA]
Not gone
 
Not gone
 
Not gone
You watch me
Just watch me
I’m calling
I’m calling
And one day all will know
