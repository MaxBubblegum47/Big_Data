[Verse 1]
Remember when you said that there's no second chance?
Oh, baby, I heard you been hoping you could change the past
You miss the long goodnights, you miss the long goodbyes
You miss the long goodnights (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
Well, did you ever think that it was hard for me
To walk it off like nothing happened, nonchalantly?
I got you feeling like, I got you feeling right
I got you feeling like (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)

[Pre-Chorus]
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself can't be illegal, illegal

[Chorus]
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me for being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me

[Verse 2]
It's hard to see me on when you've been off as hell
But I'm not gonna dull myself because you dull yourself
I know it's hard to see what you don't want to see
I know it's hard to see (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)

[Pre-Chorus]
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself can't be illegal, illegal

[Chorus]
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me for being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me

[Bridge]
I, I, I, I guess I'm hard to ignore
Pick up that jaw off the floor

[Chorus]
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
(Everything, I'm doing everything right)
So sue me for being good friends with your friends
(With your friends, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And running into you the place that we met
(The place that we met)
For being something you can't forget
(You can't forget, no)
So sue me

[Outro]
Sue me, baby
