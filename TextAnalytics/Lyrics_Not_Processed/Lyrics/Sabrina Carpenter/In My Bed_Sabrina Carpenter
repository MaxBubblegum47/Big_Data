[Verse 1]
Little things become everything
When you wouldn't think that they would
Little things weigh so heavily
Take my energy ’til it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be alone
But all these emotions won't leave me alone
I’m tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
To stop the losing all control
Hypothetically, I could let it go easy

[Chorus]
But I'm still, I'm still
I’m still, I’m still, I'm still
In my bed about it
I’m still, I'm still, I'm still
In my head about it
I'm not usually like this
I’m not usually like this
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed

[Verse 2]
Turn this pillowcase to the cooler side
Give me something I can feel
'Cause I wanna turn a page, wanna rearrange
Swing the doors wide open in my mind, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be alone (Wanna be alone)
But all these emotions won't leave me alone (Won't leave me alone)
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
To stop the losing all control (All control)
But hypothetically, I could let it go easy

[Chorus]
But I'm still, I'm still
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it (Bed about it)
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my head about it (Head about it)
I'm not usually like this
I'm not usually like this
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it

[Post-Chorus]
(Bed about it, bed about it)
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it
(Bed about it, bed about it)
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it

[Bridge]
Something chemical inside me messin' with my mind
And I can't help but feel like
I'm feeling like someone else (Someone else)
Something animal inside me
Trying to remind me there's no need
To worry about it and lose myself

[Chorus]
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my head about it (Ah)
I'm not usually like this (I'm not usually like)
I'm not usually like this (I'm not usually like)
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed about it

[Outro]
I'm still in my bed, I'm still in my bed (Oh yeah)
(Bed about it, bed about it)
I'm still in my bed
But I'm still, I'm still
I'm still in my bed about it (Oh yeah, yeah)
I'm still in my bed, I'm still in my
(Bed about it, bed about it)
But I'm still, I'm still, I'm still
In my bed
