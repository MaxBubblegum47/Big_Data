[Verse 1]
Your eyes crashin' into my eyes
Was I accidentally falling in love?
Your words didn't mean to heal the hurt
We're coincidentally more than enough

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you

[Chorus]
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

[Post-Chorus]
(Go) Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
(Go) Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose

[Verse 2]
My dreams running into your dreams
It's as if we wished on the same star
And my time changing all of your time
It's a butterfly effect on my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
All these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew? Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you
Oh, whoa

[Chorus]
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

[Post-Chorus]
(Go) Hey, huh (on purpose)
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
(Go) Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose

[Bridge]
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
Oh, you're scared

[Chorus]
You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

[Outro]
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
