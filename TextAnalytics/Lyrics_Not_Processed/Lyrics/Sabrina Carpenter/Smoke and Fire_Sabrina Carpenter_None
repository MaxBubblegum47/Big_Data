[Chorus]
(Oh-oh) Our love is running into a burning building
(Oh-oh) Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

[Verse 1]
Rumors spread like wildfire
I held a strong ground
But I've been burning down
'Cause it's like fire is all I hear about
And we are fading out
Don't wanna turn out the light
But it's like...

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm, and there goes the night

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh) Our love is running into a burning building
(Oh-oh) Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

[Verse 2]
Secrets in a small town, they always get around
But the flame has been put out
And I am hearing all the small talk
They whisper as I walk
In a house that's boarded up
So good luck

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm, and there goes the night

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh) Our love is running into a burning building
(Oh-oh) Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

[Bridge]
Smoke and fire, smoke and fire
Don't you know that if there's smoke, there's fire?
Smoke there's fire, smoke there's fire
Now, now
(Oh-oh) And now it's over
(Oh-oh) I'm getting colder
(Oh-oh) And it's the feeling
Like running into a burning building
Rumors spread like wildfire
I held a strong ground
But I've been burning down

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh) Our love is running into a burning building
(Oh-oh) Our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat, so we started running
You know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind
Burning like smoke and fire

[Outro]
Smoke and fire, smoke and fire
Don't you know that if there's smoke, there's fire?
Smoke there's fire, smoke there's fire
Now, now
(Oh-oh) And now it's over
(Oh-oh) I'm getting colder
(Oh-oh) I'm so tired
Burning like smoke and fire
