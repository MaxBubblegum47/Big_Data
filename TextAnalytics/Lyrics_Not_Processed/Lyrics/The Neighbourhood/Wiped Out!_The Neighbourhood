[Verse 1]
Lost and afraid, young and innocent but getting older
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone
Sharper the blade is, the easier it scars your soul
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
My current state is heavy
Hope it's a phase or something

[Chorus]
Don't let me go

[Verse 2]
Up and away, I'm an alien, I need a moment
I don't know what to believe
All I wanna do is leave
What can I say that would make you see, make you need me?
Maybe I won't ever know, maybe I'll end up alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Running in place (circles, in circles with you)
Don't mind me, out in a race (I didn't mean to be here)

[Chorus]
Watch me go
I don't wanna let you down
So, promise you wonâ€™t let me drown

[Bridge]
How can you feel the way that I'm feeling
If you're not inside of my head?
I got the pressure, it's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
I got some mixed emotions about how I've been getting to all these checks
Acting all funny because of the money
It's making my tummy upset
How can you feel the way that I'm feeling
If you're not inside of my head?
I got the pressure, it's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
Somebody find me a balance
Look what I did to myself and my friends
Emotions are paying the rent, oh
Emotions are paying the rent, oh

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm up and down, I'm never sati-
I'm up and down, I'm never satisfied
I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm up and down, I'm never sati-
I'm up and down, I'm never satisfied
I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm up and down, I'm never sati-
I'm up and down, I'm never satisfied
I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm up and down, I'm never sati-
I'm up and down, I'm never satisfied
