[Verse 1]
I think I talk too much
I need to listen, baby
I need to listen, baby
I need to listen good
I think I try too hard
How I look, what I do, what I'm saying
I spend too much time explaining myself
I hope there's some time to change it

[Pre-Chorus]
I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say
But you know, when you know
I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me, baby
Now I know, you should go

[Chorus]
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

[Verse 2]
I think I worry a lot
I need to take it easy
I got this anxious feeling
But it goes away for a minute
When I'm with you breathing

[Pre-Chorus]
I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say
But you know, when you know
I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me, baby
Now I know, you should go

[Chorus]
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

[Bridge]
The sun's coming out but I'm feeling colder
I can't wait 'til the drought is over

[Chorus]
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's just what I'll do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

[Outro]
Cry baby, cry baby
I need to cry, baby
Cry baby, cry baby
You need to cry, baby
Cry baby, cry baby
We need to cry
And if we do, I know that would be alright
