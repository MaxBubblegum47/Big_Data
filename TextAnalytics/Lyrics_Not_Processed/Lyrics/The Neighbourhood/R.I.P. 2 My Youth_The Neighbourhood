[Verse 1]
And R.I.P. to my youth
And you could call this the funeral
I'm just telling the truth
And you can play this at my funeral
Wrap me up in Chanel inside my coffin
Might go to hell and there ain't no stopping
Might be a sinner and I might be a saint
I'd like to be proud but somehow I'm ashamed
Sweet little baby in a world full of pain
I gotta be honest, I don't know if I could take it
Everybody's talkin' but what's anybody saying?
Mama said if I really want it, then I can change it, yeah
R.I.P. to my youth
If you really listen, then this is to you
Mama, there is only so much I can do
Tough for you to witness but it was for me too

[Chorus]
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me (In front of me)

[Verse 2]
R.I.P. to my youth
And you could call this the funeral
I'm just telling the truth, yeah
You can play this at my funeral
Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad
I'm in paradise with Dad
Close my eyes and then cross my arms
Put me in the dirt, let me dream with the stars
Throw me in a box with the oxygen off
You gave me the key and you locked every lock
When I can't breathe, I won't ask you to stop
When I can't breathe, don't call for a cop
I was naive and hopeful and lost
Now I'm aware and driving my thoughts, wow

[Bridge]
What do I do? What do I do?
I don't believe it if I don't keep proof
I don't believe it if I don't know you
I don't believe it if it's on the news or on the Internet
I need a cigarette

[Chorus]
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me
I'm using white lighters to see

[Verse 3]
R.I.P. to my youth
And you could call this the funeral
I'm just telling the truth
And you can play this at my funeral
Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad
I'm in paradise with Dad
Close my eyes and then cross my arms
Put me in the dirt, let me be with the stars

[Outro]
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me
