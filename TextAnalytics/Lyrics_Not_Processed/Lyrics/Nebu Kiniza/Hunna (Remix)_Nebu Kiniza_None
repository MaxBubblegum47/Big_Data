Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Nebu Kiniza]
Sometimes when you gone, I feel so alone
Keep it a hunna, party to the sun down
Top shelf, ya you know, check freight gotta go
Keep it a hunna, party to the sun down

[Post-Chorus: Nebu Kiniza]
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah, I notice
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah, I notice

[Verse 1: Nebu Kiniza]
I've been lovin' you for some time
But I gotta focus on me right now
Shawty fell in love with my pimpin'
Fifteen for the Gs I'm drippin'
Undersea in her see my whip, yeah
All I had to do was listen

[Chorus: Nebu Kiniza]
Sometimes when you gone, I feel so alone
Keep it a hunna, party to the sun down
Top shelf, ya you know, check freight gotta go
Keep it a hunna, party to the sun down

[Post-Chorus: Nebu Kiniza]
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah, I notice
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah, I notice

[Verse 2: Nebu Kiniza]
Laid up, yeah you know that shit is paid out
Made up, yeah you know this shit cap now
In the vet, and she drive when I'm faded
Direct deposit can't afford no delays; yeah

[Chorus: Nebu Kiniza]
Sometimes when you gone, I feel so alone
Keep it a hunna, party to the sun down
Top shelf, ya you know, check freight gotta go
Keep it a hunna, party to the sun down

[Post-Chorus: Nebu Kiniza]
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah, I notice
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah, I notice

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
...rob the bank, uh
My mask is Raf Simons, yeah
Play with that cash (Hol' up)
Young nigga got cash, yeah
Big slatt, big mob, yeah
Walk 'round with bags, yeah
Carti got a bitch all in it
All of my slimes, we litty
Whole lotta bag, lil' fifties
Whole lotta bag, let's get it
I'm in that bitch with a blicky
I'ma let that motherfucker hang out
You ain't louda cap, the hangout (Counter fo')
Lay your ass down where you hang out (Cash)
Stupid little bitch gon' bite down (Slime)
Got my dog with me, I ain't big now
Turn the bitch down, you ain't lucky
Handle my dough, you ain't lucky
Diamonds on me like typhoon
Shoot by myself, I ain't got goons
Smoke big gas (Gas)
Smell like perfume (Gas, gas)
I got a ho in Cleveland (Cash)
I fuck with her and she bleeding (Yeah, yeah)
Shawty a demon (Yeah, yeah)
Carti a demon (Yeah)
Carti a demon (Yeah, I guess)
Still in Celine (RIP my nigga)

[Chorus: Nebu Kiniza]
Sometimes when you gone, I feel so alone
Keep it a hunna, party to the sun down
Top shelf, ya you know, check freight gotta go
Keep it a hunna, party to the sun down

[Post-Chorus: Nebu Kiniza]
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah, I notice
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah, I notice
