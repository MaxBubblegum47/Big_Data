[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth & 
(G-Eazy)
]
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo (
you know
)
Oooo-oooo ooo (
story of my fucking life, haha
)
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Eazy
Uh, yeah, I might regret this when tomorrow comes
But, them drunk nights are more fun than sober ones
With every shot, they're like "Aw, here Kobe comes!"
But I got this bad bitch tryna to throw me buns
If I listened to my Uncs, all them older ones
They all talk about karma, how it slowly comes (uh)
But, life is short, enjoy it while you're young
Spend my bank account tonight and have to borrow funds
It all started with a light glass
Now I'm asking "How long could tonight last?"
Man, she had an eeh face with a tight ass
If I had a shot less, then I might pass
But, I'm faded and I got a little sedated
I can't believe we made it, every night we celebrate it
I live like Jim Morrison, no telling where I'll take it
I take her to my room and I tell her "Get naked"

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo, Oooo-oooo ooo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo, Oooo-oooo ooo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I slipped up with my ex and I smashed again
Stayed over, now she's about to get attached again
Walls built up around, they come crashing in
Passed out at 6 A.M., but she's up at 10
Doing this was not in my plans
She got up and saw rubbers in the trash can
Hoop earrings, some bitch left on my nightstand
Cussed me out and stormed off like "Alright then" (uh)
On both sides, that was bad for 'em
Why do people do things that be bad for 'em?
Say we done with these things, then we ask for 'em
When the sun comes down, then we transform
Yeah, you can probably bet this
By this time tomorrow, I'll probably regret this
Try, but it all falls down like Tetris
No telling where an 80 proof gets us

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo, Oooo-oooo ooo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
Oooo-oooo ooo ooo, Oooo-oooo ooo
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
