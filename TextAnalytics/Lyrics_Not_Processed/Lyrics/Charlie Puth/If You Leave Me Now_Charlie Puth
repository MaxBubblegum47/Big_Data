[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
No, this is not goodbye
I swear that I'm gonna change
No, baby, please don't cry
It doesn't have to end this way

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
'Cause when I think of all the nights I'll be alone
I get terrified
Please don't say goodbye

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now 
(yeah)

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
When did we lose our way?
My whole world was unravellin'
And girl, it's drivin' me insane
There's no road worth travellin'

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth & 
Boyz II Men
]
When I think about all of the nights you're gone 
(Nights you're gone, oh)
I get terrified 
(I get terrified)
Please don't say goodbye 
(bye)

[Chorus: Wanya Morris 
with Charlie Puth
]
'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out (oh)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I can promise if we parted, parted
And if you left me brokenhearted
Every single night, I'll think about you with someone else
Baby, if you leave me

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Wanya Morris]
Baby, if you leave me now (leave me now)
Oh, if you're givin' up and just walk right out 
(hey)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby if you leave me now

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Wanya Morris]
Oh girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out 
(oh, baby)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now
