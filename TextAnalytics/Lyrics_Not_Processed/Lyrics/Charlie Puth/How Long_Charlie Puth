[Intro]
Alright
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies‚Äù
Baby, I just gotta know

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady (shady)
I've been feelin' it lately, baby"

[Post-Chorus]
Ooo-oh (Yeah)
Ooo-oh (Encore)
Oooh-ooh-oh

[Verse 2]
I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmm
I try, and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She said "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies"
"Baby, I just gotta know

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby"

[Post-Chorus]
Ooo-oh (Yeah)
Ooo-oh (Encore)
Oooh-ooh-oh
How long has it been goin' on, baby?
Ooo-oh (Yeah)
Ooo-oh, you gotta go tell me now
Oooh-ooh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know

[Chorus]
How long has this been goin' on?
And you' been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby"

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooo-oh, yeah)
How long has this been goin' on?
(Ooh, encore)
You've been creepin' 'round on me
(Oooh-ooh-oh)
How long has it been goin' on, baby? Oh
(Ooo-oh)
How long has this been goin' on?
(Ooh, encore)
(You gotta go tell me now)
(Oooh-ooh-oh)
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby
