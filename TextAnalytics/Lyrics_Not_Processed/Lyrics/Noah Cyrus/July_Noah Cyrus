[Verse 1]
I've been holding my breath
I've  been counting to 10
Over  something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm  alone in bed

[Pre-Chorus]
You  know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

[Chorus]
So  tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause  you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay

[Verse 2]
Feels like a lifetime
Just tryna get by
While we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one
But I can't move on

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same

[Chorus]
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay

[Bridge]
If you want me to leave
Then tell me to leave and, baby, I'll go

[Outro]
You remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay
