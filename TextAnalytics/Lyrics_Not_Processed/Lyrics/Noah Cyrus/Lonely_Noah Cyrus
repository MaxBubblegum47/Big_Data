[Verse 1]
I'm slowly killing myself
I'm trying so hard at the back of the shelf
It's just the same every day
I'm writing these songs that will never get played
I get told what's wrong and what's right
I don't have a romantic life
And everyone's dying, so I keep on trying
To make 'em proud before they are gone

[Chorus]
But can't someone help me?
Oh, please, someone help me
I don't care, anyone, anything
'Cause I'm so sick of being so lonely
Miss all my family
I don't care, anyone, anything
'Cause I'm so sick of being so lonely

[Verse 2]
I'm spending more than I earn
Drink all the time to forget I'm not her
'Cause I go to parties sometimes
And I'll kiss a boy and pretend for the night
'Cause I don't know much about me
I'm still ashamed of who I used to be
So I try way too hard, but I still miss the mark to fit in
Fit in, woah

[Chorus]
Help me
Oh, please, someone help me
I don't care, anyone, anything
'Cause I'm so sick of being so lonely
I miss all my family
God, I don't care, anyone, anything
'Cause I'm so sick of being so lonely

[Outro]
I don't care, anyone, anything
'Cause I'm so sick of being so lonely
