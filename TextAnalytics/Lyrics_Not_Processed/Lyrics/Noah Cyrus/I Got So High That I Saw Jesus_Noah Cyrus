[Chorus]
I got so high that I saw Jesus
He said, "It's all gonna be okay
You just need me in your heart"
Tennessee whiskey and love
I got so high that I saw Jesus

[Verse 1]
Yeah, they talk about the rivers running dry
How pretty soon, there won't be any water left to turn to wine
Like a drunkard at the wedding
Blindly raising Armageddon
So, I'm a-getting high

[Chorus]
And I got so high that I saw Jesus
He said, "It's all gonna be okay
You just need me in your heart"
Tennessee whiskey and love
I got so high that I saw Jesus (Jesus)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Joseph lost his job to a machine
And Mary lost her mind to lines of code you can't see
And if the angels are the A.I
.
I'm gonna burn this whole thing down
Well, I'm gonna burn one down right now

[Chorus]
And I got so high that I saw Jesus (Oh, yeah)
He said, "It's all gonna be okay (All gonna be)
You just need me in your heart"
Tennessee whiskey and love
I got so high that I saw Jesus

[Bridge]
And sometimes, it hurts too much to look
Like Moses at the burning bush
I tried to turn away, but I could see
And he said, "Fathers, don't forsake your sons
There's so much Kingdom left to come
Just let it fill your lungs before you leave"

[Chorus]
And I got so high that I saw Jesus
He said, "It's all gonna be okay
You just need me in your heart"
Tennessee whiskey and love
I got so high that I saw Jesus

[Outro]
I got so high that I saw Jesus
I got so high that I saw Jesus
