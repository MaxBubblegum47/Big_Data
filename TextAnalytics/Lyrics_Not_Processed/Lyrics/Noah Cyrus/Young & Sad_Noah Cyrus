[Intro: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hey bud, this is ol' Dad
Just wanted you to know, you ain't alone
Keep a smile on your face, everything's gonna be fine
I love you

[Verse 1]
They say, "You should smile more
Darlin', show your eyes more"
Aren't you satisfied?
I'm tired of tryna please some
One who doesn't even
Care what's on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me go, I don't need you to wipe my tears
Don't you know I'm only tryin' to disappear?

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be young and sad another day longer
Don't wanna feel numb or mad until I go under
And I know that you only want me to be happy
But I still feel lonely tonight
Don't wanna be young and sad another day longer
Another day longer

[Verse 2]
My sister's like sunshine
Always bringing good light
Wherever she will go
And I was born to rain clouds
When they blew the flame out
Blessed in our shadows

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me go, I don't need you to wipe my tears
Don't you know I'm only tryin' to disappear?

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be young and sad another day longer
Don't wanna feel numb or mad until I go under
And I know that you only want me to be happy
But I still feel lonely tonight
Don't wanna be young and sad another day longer
Another day longer, hey

[Outro]
Don't wanna be young and sad, yeah
Don't wanna be young and sad
Don't wanna be young and sad, yeah
Don't wanna be young and sad another day longer
Don't wanna feel numb or mad until I go under
