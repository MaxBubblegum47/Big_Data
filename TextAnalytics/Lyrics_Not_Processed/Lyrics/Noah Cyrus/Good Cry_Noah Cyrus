[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I’ve been drinking this place dry for days
The man across the bar taught me his ways
They try to send me home but I can’t be alone
The cigarette smoke all in my space
I can’t find my old self through the haze
I’m searching dusk to dawn, I guess that girl is gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I took one good look at my face, God
Reality hits like a train
I don’t know why when I open my eyes I find I'm

[Chorus]
Hopeless, feeling so hopeless
Honey, I drink ‘til I’m sick
This weed don't do shit
I’m choking on my bad vibe
Loveless, feeling so loveless
Darling, the sky makes me sad
The blues got me bad
Oh, I just need a good cry

[Verse 2]
I’ve been up six days and five nights
I swallowed a pill to kill the time
I was all up in my head just me, myself, and I
This anxiety puts me to shame
And nothing could silence this pain
Baby, that’s why, I'm saying that I am feeling so

[Chorus]
Hopeless, I'm feeling so hopeless
Honey, I drink ‘til I’m sick
This weed don't do shit
I’m choking on my bad vibe
Loveless, feeling so loveless
Darling, the sky makes me sad
The blues got me bad
And I just need a good cry

[Chorus]
Oh I’m hopeless, feeling so hopeless
Honey, I’ll drink ‘til I’m sick
This weed don't do shit
I’m choking on my bad vibe
Loveless, I’m feeling so loveless
Darling, the sky makes me sad
The blues got me bad
Oh, I just need a good cry (woo!)

[Outro]
Darling, I’m sorry
Darling, I’m sorry
Darling, I’m sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I just need a good cry
