[Intro]
Uh huh
Uh huh

[Verse 1]
I've been a wild dog in this here part of town
No gun-slinging, no fool can bring me down
Now I've finally met my match and he's the baddest boy around
And I'll say it loud and proud

[Chorus]
I'm stuck, I'm stuck
That boy he messed me up
I'm a fighter, I'm a champion, but I'm hanging up the gloves
I'm stuck, I'm stuck
'Cause your love has tamed the devil out of me
Stole my heart and pulled the rug under my feet
I was a careless Casanova, but you made my heart go weak
And I'm stuck, I'm stuck

[Refrain]
Oooh oh no no
Oooh oh no no
Oooh oh no no no
I'm stuck, I'm stuck

[Verse 2]
I never liked that kind of guy who picked up the bill
The kind of guy who ate dessert before he had a meal
When you come around in your skinny jeans, I don't know how to feel
But now I know the drill

[Chorus]
I'm stuck, I'm stuck
That boy he messed me up
I'm a fighter, I'm a champion, but I'm hanging up the gloves
I'm stuck, I'm stuck
'Cause your love has tamed the devil out of me
Stole my heart and pulled the rug under my feet
I was a careless Casanova, but you made my heart go weak
And I'm stuck, I'm stuck

[Refrain]
Oooh oh no no
Oooh oh no no
Oooh oh no no no
I'm stuck, I'm stuck

[Bridge]
What he wants, he knows just what he wants
What he wants, he knows just what he wants
I'm the badass superwoman to the candy on his arm
I'm stuck, I'm stuck
(Said I'm stuck)

[Refrain]
Oooh oh no no
Oooh oh no no
Oooh oh no no no
I'm stuck, I'm stuck

[Outro]
'Cause your love has tamed the devil out of me
Stole my heart and pulled the rug under my feet
I was a careless Casanova, but you made my heart go weak
And I'm stuck, I'm stuck
(Come on over here with your skinny jeans)
