[Verse 1: Julia Michaels]
I was running on an empty heart
Not a trace of gasoline
Trying to dim every single spark
That could hurt, that could burn all of me
Like a soldier on the battleground
Lying wounded on the field
I was fighting alone with a broken sword
Now I’m caught in a war with no shield

[Chorus: Julia Michaels]
If you hold me now and leave me never
Say you’ll stay with me forever
Then I surrender, surrender
If you hold me now and leave me never
Say you’ll stay with me forever
Then I surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
I pushed and pulled all the ones that tried
Then I watched them fade away
As I look around a vacant room
I see nobody left here to blame
‘Cause I made myself a prisoner
Shackled up by all my fears
But I feel you breaking away at the walls
Make them fall make them all disappear

[Chorus: Julia Michaels]
If you hold me now and leave me never
Say you’ll stay with me forever
Then I surrender, surrender
If you hold me now and leave me never
Say you’ll stay with me forever
Then I surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender
Hold me now and leave me never
Say you’ll stay with me forever
Then I surrender, surrender, yeah
Then I surrender, surrender, yeah
Ooh, surrender
