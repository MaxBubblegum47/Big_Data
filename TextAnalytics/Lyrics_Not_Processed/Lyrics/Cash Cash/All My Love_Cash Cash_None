[Verse 1]
Friday night, my phone is off
And none of my friends even know you're gone
All these broken picture frames
I'm sick of your face, but can't look away

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't go out, can't stay home
I don't know how, how to be alone
I keep waiting for you, waiting for you to come back
With all of my love

[Chorus]
How can I sleep when you're out there with all my love?
I can't believe that you left here with all my love
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back, oh woah
All my love
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back, oh woah
All my love

[Post-Chorus]
(All my love)
(All my love)

[Verse 2]
Friday night locked in these sheets
I toss and I turn, where you used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't go out, can't stay home
I don't know how, how to be alone
I keep waiting for you, waiting for you to come back
With all of my love

[Chorus]
How can I sleep when you're out there with all my love?
I can't believe that you left here with all my love
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back, oh woah
All my love (All my love)
Bring it back, bring it back, back, back, oh woah
All my love

[Post-Chorus]
I gotta get back, get back, yeah, all my love
(All my love)
I gotta get back, get back, yeah, all my love
