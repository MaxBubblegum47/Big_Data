[Intro: Busta Rhymes, B.o.B]
Cash Cash
Busta Bust
(It's Bobby)
Let's go!

[Chorus: Neon Hitch]
I been dancing with the devil, he was always good to me
And I've been walking in the shadow of a friendly enemy
But now I'm fucking broken, living in the moment
Shoulda known that you would bring me down
Yeah, I been dancing with the devil, like, oh, oh, oh, oh
The Cash Cash make my ass bounce back

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
It's Bobby
I guess I'll play the bad guy
I swear I told you last time
You knew I wasn't good for you
But you swore you hit the jackpot
And you swore you struck gold
You were stepping on your toes
Always tripping over nothing
But nothing's on the floor
I swear the time it takes
To congregate and conversate
Just so things don't complicate
I just don't have the time of day
To try to pay attention to what your momma say
She just moving lips, moving lips
Talking 'bout stupid shit, stupid shit
And she don't know how to keep the man
But she can move them hips, move them hips

[Chorus: Neon Hitch]
I been dancing with the devil, he was always good to me
And I've been walking in the shadow of a friendly enemy
But now I'm fucking broken, living in the moment
Shoulda known that you would bring me down
Yeah, I been dancing with the devil, like, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Let's go!
And I love the way shorty get low
And the way she bending over and she touching on her toes
Momma see me looking at her then she wanna pose
I don't even know why shawty got on any clothes
And you really know already what I'm gonna drop
Hella money, mami wanna come up to the top
I walk a little closer then I do my Diddy bop
I love the way she moving and the way she make it pop
And I'm loving the way that you're making it bounce and you're moving it, doing it
See the way that you're breaking it down, the way you got them all losing it
Get it, lit, shake it, shake it
Bounce, turn up, level, level
Do it nasty like you out here dancing with the devil

[Bridge: Neon Hitch]
Hey, hey, hey
I knew you were trouble, trouble, trouble
Don't wanna look you in the fa-a-ace
I knew you were trouble, trouble, trouble

[Chorus: Neon Hitch]
I been dancing with the devil, he was always good to me
And I've been walking in the shadow of a friendly enemy
But now I'm fucking broken, living in the moment
Shoulda known that you would bring me down
Yeah, I been dancing with the devil, like, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Neon Hitch (Busta Rhymes)]
Shoulda known that you would bring me down
Yeah, I been dancing with the devil, like, oh, oh, oh, oh
The Cash Cash make my ass bounce back
(With the devil
W-w-w-with the devil
D-d-d-dancing with the devil)
