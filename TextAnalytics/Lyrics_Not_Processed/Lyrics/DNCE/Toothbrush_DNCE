[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Verse 1]
Stuck in a limbo, half hypnotized
Each time I let you stay the night, stay the night
Up in the morning, tangled in sheets
We play the moment on repeat, on repeat

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing there in your underwear
And my T-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Post-Chorus]
I just, I just can't let you go
Give me something I've never known
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Verse 2]
No need to question next time we meet
I know you’re coming home with me, home with me
Sweat like a sauna, break up the ice
I know you’re gonna stay the night, stay the night

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing there in your underwear
And my T-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Post-Chorus]
I just, I just can't let you go
Give me something I've never known
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't want this to end
And there's no need to play pretend
If you stay with me again
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Post-Chorus]
I just, I just can't let you go
Give me something I've never known
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave your toothbrush at my place, at my place
