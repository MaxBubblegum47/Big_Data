[Intro]
Nah, nah, nah
Cake by the ocean

[Verse 1]
Oh, no
See you walking 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious girl, why those feet cold?
We just getting started, don't you tiptoe, tiptoe

[Pre-Chorus]
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece 
(Huh)
You should be rollin' with me, you should be rollin' with me 
(Ahh)
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy 
(Huh)
But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously

[Chorus]
Talk to me, baby
I'm goin' blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya, I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean

[Verse 2]
Goddamn
See you licking frosting from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm begging, yes ma'am
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Waste time with a masterpiece
Don't waste time with a masterpiece 
(Huh)
You should be rollin' me, you should be rollin' me 
(Ahh)
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy 
(Huh)
But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously, whoa

[Chorus]
Talk to me, baby
I'm goin' blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy 
(Ahh!)
Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya, I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean 
(Huh)
Walk for me, baby 
(Walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya, I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean 
(Yeah, yeah)

Ooh, ah, ah
Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya, I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
Ooh, ah, ah

Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya, I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
