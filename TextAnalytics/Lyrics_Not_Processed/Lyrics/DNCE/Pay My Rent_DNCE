[Verse 1]
Been runnin' now, runnin' so smoothly
We'll never slow down
Been thinkin' now, thinkin' down on one knee
Time to say it out loud

[Pre-Chorus]
When you love so good
Wanna give you every hour
If you said you could
I would give you all the power

[Chorus]
But would you pay my rent? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you pay my rent? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you, would you, would you get your love well spent? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you pay my rent? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you, would you, would you, would you pay my rent?

[Verse 2]
I'll never say never to your wishes
I'll never let you fall
You always know, always know I'm with it
I'm always on call

[Pre-Chorus]
When you love so good 
(Love so good)
Wanna give you every hour
If you said you could 
(Said you could)
I would give you all the power

[Chorus]
But would you pay my rent? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you pay my rent? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you, would you, would you get your love well spent? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you pay my rent? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you, would you, would you?

[Bridge]
How can you love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right?
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money?
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right?
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money?
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right?
(You gotta get your money right, girl)
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right?

[Pre-Chorus]
When you love so good
(Love me right, love me right, if you don't get your money right)
Wanna give you every hour
(Love me right, love me right, if you don't get your money right)
If you said you could
(Love me right, love me right, if you don't get your money right)
I would give you all the power

[Chorus]
But would you pay my rent? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you pay my rent? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you, would you, would you get your love well spent?
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you pay my rent? 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Would you, would you, would you?

[Outro]
How can you love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right?
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money?
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your money right?
Love me right, love me right
If you don't get your... would you pay my rent?
