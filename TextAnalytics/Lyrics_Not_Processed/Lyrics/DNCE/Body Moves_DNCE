[Intro]
Ow!
Hey!
That's right
Oh!

[Verse 1]
Side by side
Walkin' home, stumblin' home, gettin' curious
What's on your mind?
'Cause what's on mine's a dirty mind, why so serious?

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, the stars above will light the way
Just take my hand and hear the words I say
Yeah, when the morning comes, I'll always stay
You gotta know, you gotta know that I'm feeling this, ow!

[Chorus]
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow!)
Come on home with me, oh baby, let it loose
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (Yeah, just a little bit)

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need it, but you know how bad I want it
And your touch has got me haunted, but I li-i-ike it
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow!)

[Verse 2]
Got all night
Show me more, a little more, it's gettin' scandalous
Yeah, all my life, yeah
Been waitin' for the girl next door to get real dangerous

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, the stars above will light the way
Just take my hand and hear the words I say
Yeah, when the morning comes, I'll always stay
You gotta know, you gotta know that I'm feeling this, ow!

[Chorus]
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow!)
Come on home with me, oh baby, let it loose
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (Yeah, just a little bit)

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need it, but you know how bad I want it
And your touch has got me haunted, but I li-i-ike it
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow!)

[Bridge]
Ha, that's right, haha
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, when the morning comes, I'll always stay
You gotta know, you gotta know that I'm feeling this, ow!

[Chorus]
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow!)
Come on home with me, oh baby, let it loose
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (Yeah, just a little bit)

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need it, but you know how bad I want it
And your touch has got me haunted, but I li-i-ike it
Come and roll with me, we'll rock them body moves
Me and you (Oh, just a little bit)
Body moves (Yeah, just a little bit, ow!)

[Outro]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
