[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Hey, I'm standing in the bed we made
Guess I never felt the part, I'm kickin' all the sheets away

[Refrain: Joe Jonas]
Oh, I'm jumpin' off a sinking ship
I guess I should've read the stars
I would've known that it would end like this

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Oh, you never make me decent
Oh, you never make me strong
Oh, you never let me finish
No, you ne-

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I throw my hands up
I've already made my mind up
Never get down on my luck
Never get down on my-y-y-y-y-y-y
Hands up
I've already made my mind up
Sorry, I messed your life up
I'ma get on with mine-e-e-e-e-e-e-e

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Oh, 'cause the clock keeps tickin'
My-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
Oh, 'cause the clock keeps tickin'
Ti-ti-tickin'

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Hey, been drivin' down a dead-end street
Do I let another dragon fly? Gonna sweep another off her feet

[Refrain: Joe Jonas]
Oh, I'm jumpin' off a sinking ship
I guess I should have read the stars
I wouldâ€™ve known that it would end like this

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Oh, you never make me decent
Oh, you never make me strong
Oh, you never let me finish
No, you ne-

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I throw my hands up
I've already made my mind up
Never get down on my luck
Never get down on my-y-y-y-y-y-y
Hands up
I've already made my mind up
Sorry, I messed your life up
I'ma get on with mine-e-e-e-e-e-e-e

[Post-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Oh, 'cause the clock keeps tickin'
My-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
Oh, 'cause the clock keeps tickin'
Ti-ti-tickin'

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I throw my hands up
I've already made my mind up
Never get down on my luck
Never get down on my-y-y-y-y-y-y
Hands up
I've already made my mind up
Sorry, I messed your life up
I'ma get on with mine-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
Hands up
I've already made my mind up
Never get down on my luck
Never get down on my-y-y-y-y-y-y
Hands up
I've already made my mind up
Sorry, I messed your life up
I'ma get on with mine-e-e-e-e-e-e-e

[Outro: Joe Jonas]
Mine-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
Mine-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
Mine-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
Mine-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
