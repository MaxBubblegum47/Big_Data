[Verse 1]
In the darkest hour when I cannot breathe
Fear is on my chest, the weight of the world on me
Everything is crashing down, everything I had known
When I wonder if I'm all alone

[Chorus]
I remember, I remember
You have always been faithful to me
I remember, I remember
Even when my own eyes could not see
You were there, always there

[Verse 2]
I will lift my eyes even in the pain
Above all the lies, I know You can make a way
I have seen giants fall, I have seen mountains move
I have seen waters part, because of You

[Chorus]
I remember
I remember
You have always been faithful to me
I remember
I remember
Even when my own eyes could not see
You were there, always there

[Bridge]
I can't stop thinking about
I can't stop thinking about
I can't stop thinking about
Your goodness

I can't stop thinking about
I can't stop thinking about
I can't stop thinking about
Your goodness

I can't stop thinking about
I can't stop thinking about
I can't stop thinking about
Your goodness

I can't stop thinking about
I can't stop thinking about
I can't stop thinking about
Your goodness

[Chorus]
I remember
I remember
You have always been faithful to me
I remember
I remember
Even when my own eyes could not see
You were there, always there with me
