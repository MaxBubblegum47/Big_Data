I ain't never asked for a handout
But I came up, now everybody got a hand out
I just got my truck on matte red, with a 5% tint and them rims blacked out
Every nigga 'round me gon' wait 'til I blackout
Put the pussy on him, make a nigga tap out
Just say where and my niggas pop-out
If you don't get the picture, we crop you out
They givin' out pussy like shout-outs
These lil' bitches live in my shadow 
(Whoo)
They see me in person and panic 
(Ooh)
My diamonds, they color of candy 
(Ayy)
I'm electric shockin' these bitches like Pikachu
Don't run away from me when I run into you
It can get surgical, personal
Everything I do be goin' up, I'm on my vertical
Yes, I'm a girl, I go harder than niggas do
I'm in a- I'm in a- I'm in a Benz that's the color of Fruity Loops
I count the 30s been lookin' so beautiful
I bet you hatin' on me from a cubicle, my nigga-, what?
I got more money than you on my cuticle
When I pull up, all the bitches like "Aah"
Only leave the house when I'm pickin' up a bag
Got a short temper, don't make me mad, what?
Got a short temper, 
don't make me mad
Don't make me mad, don't make me mad, don't make me mad
Hold on,
 ooh

Uh
See, what's the cost of a dollar when you don't have shit
And you down upon your last bit?
And every moment pass that makes you wonder what can happen
Sippin' Henny frozen
Feelin' spaced out like a semi-colon 
(Semi-colon)
Made a million, life is really golden
But what's most important
When you hope for portions of a dope endorsement
Only hang with thoroughbreds, no broken horses 
(Ooh)
Cruisin' in the Mustang, like I must change 
(Must change)
Tinted windows, couldn't even hide the bloodstains 
(Ooh)
Fuck a bitch in luxury, she gave me plush brain 
(Plush brain
)
Got no time for love games, got too much fame
The issue is, all the lies that's told, too habituous 
('Bituous)
To the point where you don't realize
What type of bitch you is 
(Bitch you is)
The friendliest niggas, the envious niggas
Been that way since the beginning, 'til infinity, nigga
Everything is on the ups but can he deliver?
I'll far surpass, expectations, the stars amass
Life gon be grand like my father's dad
Nigga, we gon' take that crown that you thought you had
I said, Uh, dump my old bitch 'cause she was too basic
Now my new girl claimin' that I'm too racist 
(What?)
'Cause I don't really like green, only Bluefaces
 
(Yeah, aight)
Whole outfit new, to the shoelaces, ugh!
They say that he so classy
But I just wanna be poppin' like Rico Nasty

[Verse 3: Blueface &

XXL just went stupid
If he trippin', then he fallin', stupid 
(Woo)
Drop top Martin the Lawrence, my shit ruthless
I need a Kim Possible to play with my Rufus
 
(Ugh)
Famous Cryp
, 
if I pulled up then she blew it
Hate to be my ex-bitch 'cause she salty like some mucus 
(Woo)
No time for nonsense, I need a deposit
I wanted to be rich instead of regular, so I left college 
(Fuck)
I get paid the most just to do the least
I get paid to preach the word like a priest
It's easy, famous crip, niggas could never be me
You 40, still workin', I spent 40 on this rollie, ooh
Sauce drippin' when I'm dressin' 
(Yeah)
Buzzer beater VVSs
I ain't text her back, but she still got the message
Ooh 
(Oww)
