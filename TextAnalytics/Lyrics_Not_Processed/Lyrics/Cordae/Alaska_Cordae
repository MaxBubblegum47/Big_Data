[Intro]
Maddox on the beat
M.W.A. Music
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position

[Verse 1]
The game is over, my pain is over, you a lame, a joker
You can't catch me plus my flow is nasty and my name is vulgar
YBN, go and try again, we be the flyest friends
I do my thing, plus I pull some strings just like a violin
Let me tell you 'bout my life and my troubled past
Momma's car got stolen, took the shuttle pass
Re-up from three bucks copped the duffle bag
Please bruh, off these nuts, go and rush some cash
And now we winning again, my brothers spending a band
My niggas posted on the block, damn I be sinning with friends
I'm chasing twenties, Benjamins, and breaking barriers too
My family rich for generations, I might marry a Jew
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position, uh

[Verse 2]
My lifestyle too wild, I know
Everything change with a new high low
Fifty bands, what I cashed in, my show
I got that gas, this that hydro
I'm too great, I don't have rivals
Niggas be telling speed dial 5-0
Cause these niggas be fake, I'm a winner these days
Motherfuckers be sweet, with a hint of cheesecake
Syrup spilling, coughin' penicillin
Heads turning walking in the building
Ledge burnin' often I'm a villain
Was deserted, brought up by some real ones
Had to catch it reckless, was a daily
Momma calling checking on her baby
Took a trip to Texas going crazy
Eating beats for breakfast, I'm elated
I was stressing, blessings on the way
Dropped out, no testing me today
Murder tracks, I bet I beat the case
Redbone, she built like LisaRaye
Stack my chips I bought my Frito Lay
I don't listen what these people say
Fuck a Honda, niggas need a Wraith
Damn the whole team eating great

[Chorus]
Ayy, cook it up, whip it up faster
Diamonds cold swear that shit from Alaska ayy
I'm getting close to disaster, ayy
Boy tell that shit to my pastor
I was flipping, whipping, dipped in the kitchen
These niggas tripping, put the game in submission
I'm Scottie Pippen, but I ball like a Piston
The shotty rippin' in a fucked up position (ah)
