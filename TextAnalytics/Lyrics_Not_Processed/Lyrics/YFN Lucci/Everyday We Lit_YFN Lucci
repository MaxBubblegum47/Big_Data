[Chorus: PnB Rock & 
YFN Lucci
]
I came up from nothing, nigga, you can't tell me shit, yeah
Did it on my own, check out my neck, check out my wrist
, yeah
I swear I ain't never expected it to be like this
Now a nigga gettin' rich I swear everyday we lit
Everyday we lit, yeah, you can't tell me shit, yeah
'Member I was broke, yeah, now I'm gettin' rich, yeah
Yeah, when yo' diamonds colder than a bitch, then you know you lit
When you quick to take a nigga bitch, then you know you lit
Everyday we lit, yeah, everyday we lit, yeah
Everyday we lit, yeah, everyday we lit, yeah
Everyday we lit, everyday we lit (uh-huh)
Everyday we lit, yeah, everyday we lit

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Can't wait to get that Vacheron, put that on my arm
Just counted a 50 with my mom, the boy a don
All my cars came foreign, my chain glowin'
I ain't goin', man, look where we came from
Uh, all yo' bangers got my name on it, yeah, yeah
She want me to put my name on it
I got the hottest 16, one of the best you've ever seen
But she like it when I sing on it

[Chorus: PnB Rock & 
YFN Lucci

I came up from nothing, nigga, you can't tell me shit, yeah

Everyday we lit, yeah, you can't tell me shit, yeah
'Member I was broke, yeah, now I'm gettin' rich, yeah
Yeah, when yo' diamonds colder than a bitch, then you know you lit
When you quick to take a nigga bitch, then you know you lit
Everyday we lit, yeah, everyday we lit, yeah
Everyday we lit, yeah, everyday we lit, yeah
Everyday we lit, everyday we lit (uh-huh)

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Can't wait to get that new drop, put that on my block, yeah
