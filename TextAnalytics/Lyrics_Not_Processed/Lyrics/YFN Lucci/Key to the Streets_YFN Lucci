[Hook: Quavo & YFN Lucci]
I got money way before the deal
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
I might fuck your ho and pay her bills
Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah
I got your ho on a leash
Got a plug, he Vietnamese
We the niggas they wanna be
Cause we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Young nigga from the Nawf (aye, Nawf yea)
Got my eye on the streets like a hawk (aye, hawk yea)
Wrap ‘em, put ‘em on a boat (wrap 'em), boy you better not choke (boy)
And there ain't no runnin' off (na, na)
We got the key to the streets (streets), everybody notice me (me)
Used to dream about 50 thousand in my jeans
Now 50 thousand cheap to me
Remember the days watching the Hot Boys and Master P
Now I’m down in Miami, one phone call, I pull up on Weezy (brr)
All of my niggas with me, you feel me
Straps on everybody in the building
All of niggas came from dealing
Or either they kicking in doors and stealing
I feel like I’m not having no feelings
Before the fame, seen quarter million
Came from robbing pizza man at the top of apartment buildings

Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah

Got a plug, he Vietnamese
We the niggas they wanna be
Cause we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
I’m from the dirty, we play dirty
All these sticks they dirty, we don’t fight, get murdered
If my niggas say fuck you then I’m sorry for you
If my niggas ain’t fucking, then get out ho, hurry
Real trapper never seen a drought, we gon’ ship ‘em out
Any problem, we gon’ air ‘em out, what they talking ‘bout?
We don't count we weigh it now, no we ain’t servin’ no ounce
We sip purple, we ain’t never out, we ain’t never out
Hit up Quavo, we gon’ need another bando
I’ma flood that bitch with more keys than a piano
All these bitches say they love me, I’m so handsome
Yeah they know ‘bout Lucci go and ask 'em, they gon tell ya

[Verse 3: Takeoff & Trouble]
I got the key to the streets my nigga
Just like Dr. Dre, he got the beats
I come straight up out of 1500
That’s the block, my niggas over East
Double cup but no ice tea (lean)
Pour me a four before I go to sleep
Fuck around and landed in the hospital
Geekin’ off the Henn and the lean, whoa
Takeoff! (Sup Skoob?)
Man, go head, take off (Bet!)
24/7, no day off (naw), balling like we in the playoffs (ball)
20 bitches at the playhouse
You quick to freeze up when that K out (graow)
If that bitch ain’t tryna fuck, I kick her out the house
Like Martin, lil bitty bitch stay out (bitch)
They like to whoop me ’til them Ks out
Get to looking for some ways out
You niggas ain’t workin’, you're laid off
Choppa decapitate him, blow his face off (graow)
Won’t get it ‘til these niggas laid out
Assassinating, knock him off like I’m Adolf (baow)
Been getting money, 19 with a 650
Nut seen me stunting, B.I.P. Blood
