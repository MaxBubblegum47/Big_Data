Frosty the snowman
Was a happy, jolly soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Oh, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
(Frosty the snowman)
(Frosty the snowman)
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler "Stop!"
Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying "Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day"
(Frosty the snowman) Ohh-ohh
(Frosty the snowman) Ohh-ohh
(Frosty the snowman) Oh
(Frosty the snowman) Oh-oh
(Frosty the snowman) Ohh, oh-oh
(Frosty the snowman) Oh, yeah
(Frosty the snowman) Don't cry, oh-ohh
(Frosty the snowman) Oh, yeah
