Do I want you for my baby?
Do I want you by my side?
Do I wanna run and kiss your lips
And say you're my loving guy?

Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (Do I love you?)
Oh, oh, oh (Yes I love you)

Do I need your arms around me?
Do I live my life for you?
Do I always feel so warm each time
I look in your eyes of blue?

Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (Do I love you?)
Oh, oh, oh (Yes I love you)
Oh, oh

And do I need you every minute of the day?
And would I die if you should ever go away?
And does it mean so much to feel your tender touch?
Do I love you? (Do I love you?)
Really love you? (really love you?)

Oh I swear I'm gonna get you if takes me all my life
I'll hope and pray and dream and scheme
'Cause I'm gonna be your wife

Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (Do I love you?)
Oh, oh, oh (Yes I love you)

Do I love you?
Yes I love you
Do I love you?
Yes I love you
Do I love you?
Yes I love you
Do I love you?
Yes I love you
