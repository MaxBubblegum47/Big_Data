You know I've been wanting you
My whole life through
And now that you're my guy
I'm gonna live and die for only you

Baby, baby, now you're gonna know
All the ways I plan to thrill you so
You're gonna see
There's a lifetime of love in me
Just for you, baby
You, baby
Ooh, baby
Just for you
Whoa-oh, only you

Could have made me wait this long
Wanting your kiss
But now you're really mine
I'll make up for the time you've made us miss

Baby, baby, now that it's all right
I'm gonna hug and kiss you every night
You're gonna see
That I saved all the love in me
Just for you, baby
You, baby
Ooh, baby
Just for you
Whoa-oh, only you

You, baby
You, baby
Ooh, baby
Just for you
Whoa-oh, only you
Oh

You, baby
You, baby
Oh, baby
Just for you
Whoa-oh, only you
Oh

You, baby
