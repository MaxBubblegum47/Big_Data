[Verse 1]
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring tingle tingling too
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "Yoo hoo!"
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)

[Verse 2]
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Were snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
