Just won't come out right
Checked my work all night
Gotta try again, something different
My hypothesis can't be wrong
Gotta try again, gotta try again

Late in the lab one time this week
I saw one tube had sprung a leak
I proceeded to grab my notes of the week
And I found my thoughts needed just one tweak

Just one thing that I haven't been seeing
Turned to two things that I haven't been seeing
Now this whole thing is messed up, there's no meaning
Gotta try again till I find some meaning
1, 2, 3, 4...
