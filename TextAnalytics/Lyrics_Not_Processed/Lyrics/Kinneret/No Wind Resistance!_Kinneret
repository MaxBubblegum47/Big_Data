[Intro]
I don't know how it ends, I can't see it in the distance
But can you ever reach the end of a timeless existence?

[Chorus]
I'll bet ya I can run faster with no wind resistance
I'll fly under no conditions
Teach myself complete submission
While I grant myself complete permission

[Verse 1]
Just imagine being human
Hating your confusion
Denying till it's proven
Laughing at illusion
Thinking institution's the solution
While tyranny and irony float in its pollution
Imagine reducing yourself to your name
Janet, you've got no one else you can blame
You've stuck all your conscience inside of your brain
So no you just shoot stuff inside of your veins
So go ahead and find your meaning
With your methamphetamine
And once you can see that you've trapped all your grace
Maybe you'll join me and girl we can race

[Chorus]
I'll bet ya I can run faster with no wind resistance
I'll fly under no conditions
Teach myself complete submission
While I grant myself complete permission

[Refrain]
No streets, receipts
Off-beat heartbeats
Just window seats
For free, for free

[Verse 2]
I've been here 60 years and I'm still not bored
There's absolutely nothing that I can't afford
And I've found that almost everything is made of cardboard
And there's absolutely nothing I can't sing with weird chords and

[Chorus]
I can run faster with no wind resistance
I'll fly under no conditions
Teach myself complete submission
While I grant myself complete permission
