Floating in a spacecraft
While I analyze a big graph
And someone's saying something mean in the distance
But in my spacecraft I don't listen

Judgmental girl named Janet (Janet, Janet)
So much smaller than the planets (Planets, planets)
Stars have been here for millennia
So much longer than America

Maybe I'm lightyears away
Maybe I'll fly lightyears away
Don't mean to leave but I'm flying away
Baby don't try and make me stay

I don't really like them
No, they keep me from my passions
I wish compassion was in fashion
Wish Lennon taught them to imagine

Whatever happened to the playgrounds
I swear they banned them all in this town
I just so happened to find out
I swear there's something going around

Maybe I'm lightyears away
Maybe I'll fly lightyears away
Don't mean to leave but I'm flying away
Baby don't try and make me stay

Now everything looks so much nicer from afar
All the billboards, well, their colors blend
The string lights in your room got nothing on the stars
And you're crazy if you think you're gonna see me again

Maybe I'll fly lightyears away
Don't mean to leave but I'm flying away
Baby don't try and make me stay
