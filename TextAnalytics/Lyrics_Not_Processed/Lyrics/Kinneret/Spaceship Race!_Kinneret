[Verse 1]
Switch to all the right gears
Put some reverb on the engine
Gonna try to learn my lesson
So I can beat you in the next one

[Chorus]
Spaceship race! How fast are you?
Think that you can follow
I think that I can follow
Spaceship race! How fast are you?
Look around, I'm flying through
Infinity, come follow
I think that you can follow
Spaceship race! How fast are you?

[Verse 2]
The fuel is not flammable, just so you know
And I don't feel very tamable, just so you know
In my spaceship I'm an animal, just so you know
Soar through the stars like I'm their equal
In a galaxy of people
Some just gotta tame their egos
Black holes will suck up all their evil!
You know it's inevitable
The stars are omnipotent, evil's unstable
This is magnificent, now we are able
Race, time, space, leave hate on the table
Then disintegrate the table
Now we are enabled

[Chorus]
Spaceship race! How fast are you?
Think that you can follow
I think that I can follow
Spaceship race! How fast are you?
Look around, I'm flying through
Infinity, come follow
I think that you can follow
Spaceship race! How fast are you?

[Refrain]
Flying by
Saturn's ring looks just like mine
Flying by
Black matter looks just like my mind
Flying by
My mind can't die even if my body dies
Flying by
Time flies by and I'll never know why

[Verse 3]
But up here we've got many days
You'll lose, you'll win, you'll rest days
Average, worst, and best days
North, south, east, and west days
Don't worry, there's no test days
Don't worry, there's no hurry
Go fast or slow, no worries
All I used to know was worry
Now I forgot how to worry, I'm too busy witching gears
Reverb on the engine sounds like music to my ears
All this black matter distorting all my fears
And I'm 'bout to switch keys just like I just switched gears
In the-

[Chorus]
Spaceship race! How fast are you?
Think that you can follow
I think that I can follow
Spaceship race! How fast are you?
Look around, I'm flying through
Infinity, come follow
I think that you can follow
Spaceship race! How fast are you?

[Outro, Spoken]
"Alright, where we going next?"
"Wanna visit my friend Jerry?"
"Yeah, he's the one that lives on planet Polka Dot, right?"
"Yeah!"
"For sure, I'll race you."
