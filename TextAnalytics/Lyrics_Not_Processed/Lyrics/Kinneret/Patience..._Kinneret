Almost there
Not quite there
If I must play fair
It'll take long to get there
And it's getting to me
But I try not to let it use me
Learned to make it groovy
Just like the groovy smoothie
You know T-Bo did it right in iCarly
Sold things on a stick
Made them fit, now that's gnarly
He used his patience smartly
Impatient hardly
Wish I could live whole-heartedly
Like I could kiss the journey
Like I could kiss my heart
Wouldn't sell it on a stick
But like it just enough to show it to my friends
Wanna show it to my friends
Gotta keep doing my assignments
Fixing this alignment
Master the refinement
Maybe be enlightened
Environmentally, you'd think that I would be excited
Toss away my talent
With all grades heightened
I'm sorry, I'm frightened
They don't like my insight
Complexity is finite
That just ain't quite right
I'll go take my birthright
Just the parts that I like
The parts that give me insight
Find a place for insight...
Almost there
Not quite there
If I must play fair
It'll take long to get there
Yes I'm stuck in my head
I can't get out can you hear me
Yes I'm stuck in my head
Run away please don't be near me
When I'm stuck in my head
Crows watch me past the fence
Zone swap, see past events
Write my notes in hieroglyphs
I'm just doodlin' my dreams away
I hope they come and play
I feel trapped in school like every day
My mind is just erased
Yes my mind is just on blank
Erased
