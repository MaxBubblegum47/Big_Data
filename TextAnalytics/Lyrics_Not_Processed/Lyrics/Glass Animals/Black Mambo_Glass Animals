[Verse 1]
"What’ll it be now Mr. Mole?"
Whispers sloth in curls of smoke
"Take a back seat, or play pharaoh
Dance with me and shake your bones"

[Chorus]
Slow down
It’s a science
He’s been waiting to
Bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you dry

[Verse 2]
Leopards laze each on plush pillows
Slender capes of red and chrome
Paperback dreams in their deep doze
Twitch their toes to black mambo

[Chorus]
Slow down
It’s a science
He’s been waiting to
Bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you dry

[Verse 3]
Wanna play cheat now says the sloth
A domino flush to his nose
Tickle that cheek and take your throne
Pump your veins with gushing gold

[Chorus]
Slow down
It’s a science
He’s been waiting to
Bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you dry

[Outro]
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
