[Verse 1]
Put your hand down boy
Welcome to my zoo
Put your head inside
My big black wild, while
I can still help you
See the snake baboon
Funky, chic and smooth
Honey can you spy
The divine ape-swine
Cause he can see you

[Chorus]
I’m a man, I’m a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I’m a man don’t spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I’m crooked but upright

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I ever want
Is just a little love
I said in purrs under the palms
And all I ever want is breaking me apart
I said to the thing that I once was

[Chorus]
I’m a man, I’m a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I’m a man don’t spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I’m crooked but upright

[Verse 2]
To the left now boy
Underneath the moon
By the thick tan sand
And the tall thin grass
One more thing for you
See the distant flume
In the sleepy dunes
Makes my nerves clench close
And my bones go cold
When I see that room

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I ever want
Is just a little love
I said in purrs under the palms
And all I ever want is breaking me apart

[Chorus]
I’m a man, I’m a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I’m a man don’t spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I’m crooked but upright
