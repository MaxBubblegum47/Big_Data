[Intro]
Oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
When I was young and stupid (Oh)
My love left to be a rock and roll star (Oh)
He told me, "Please, don't worry" (Oh)
Wise little smile that spoke so safely (Oh)
He booked a one-way ticket (Oh)
Out west, that's where they make it (Oh)
Six kids stuck in a bedsit (Oh)
To sunswept poolside riches (Oh)
(Oh, oh)
He met a girl who wore Versace (Oh)
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewelryâ€‹ (Oh)
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon (Oh)
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon (Oh)
He's got a gold Camaro (Oh)
He said over the payphone (Oh)
I try to keep my cool but (Oh)
My life turns in slow motion (Oh)

[Chorus]
Bye-bye, baby blue
I wish (Oh) you could see the wicked truth
Caught up (Oh) in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming (Oh) at the sun you blow into
Curled up (Oh) in a grip when we were us
Fingers (Oh) in a fist like you might run
I settle (Oh) for a ghost I never knew
Super (Oh) paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost

[Verse 2]
Where I was from in NOLA
No one (Oh) left to be a rock and roll star (Oh)
He'd stay and treat his lady (Oh)
Give everything to his new baby (Oh)
I miss him, don't you blame me? (Oh)
That boy went stone cold crazy (Oh)
Caught up in camera lust (Oh)
He's chasing that pappy pipe dream (Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)

[Bridge]
I know you don't but I-
I know you don't but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone but I-
That girl is gone but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit but maybe (Oh) not
I feel so fucking numb
It hits my head and I feel (Oh) numb
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong (Oh)
My body's looking wrong (Oh)

[Chorus]
Bye-bye, baby blue
I wish (Oh) you could see the wicked truth
Caught up (Oh) in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming (Oh) at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers (Oh) in a fist like you might run
I settle (Oh) for a ghost I never knew
Super (Oh) paradise I held on to
But I settle (Oh) for a ghost

[Outro]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
