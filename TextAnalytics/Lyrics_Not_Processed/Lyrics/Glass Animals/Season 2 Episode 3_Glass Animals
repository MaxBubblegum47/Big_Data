[Chorus]
Don't you need me
Oh baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise

[Verse 1]
Baby, now my head is on backwards
And my feet at funny angles
And every time I take a step
We're moving forwards faster
And lately, I can't take it
Baby, now my body's intact
And in an ordinary fashion
And everything I tried to leave behind
Is still beside us
And lately, I can't take it

[Pre-Chorus]
Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
She's broken but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar while she's getting blazed

[Chorus]
"Don't you need me
Oh baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"

[Verse 2]
Lazy, and lying on your belly
With a Super Porp cola
Looking at your phone in clothes
You've worn for three days over
With a cookie as a coaster
Maybe, I wish I could remould you
To vertical and golden
But you turned to Styrofoam
And so it hurts to say it's hopeless
And we ain't gonna make it

[Pre-Chorus]
Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
She's broken but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar while she's getting blazed

[Verse 3]
She's drunk on old cartoons
Liquid TV afternoons
Sometimes it makes me laugh
Sometimes it makes me sad

[Chorus]
"Don't you need me
Oh baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"
"Don't you need me
You baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"

[Outro]
Oh, baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm, baby, now my head is on backwards
Oh, baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm, baby, now my head is on backwards
"Don't you need me
You baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"
