[Verse 1]
Boy, when I left you you were young
I was gone, but not my love
You were clearly meant for more
Than a life lost in the war

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

[Chorus]
Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right

[Verse 2]
Boy, now your life is back-to-front
But you'll see that's not for long
'Cause I know you'll feel the ghost
Of some memories so warm

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

[Chorus]
Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

[Chorus]
Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right
I'll make you...

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit...

(Outro)
Oh oh oh
