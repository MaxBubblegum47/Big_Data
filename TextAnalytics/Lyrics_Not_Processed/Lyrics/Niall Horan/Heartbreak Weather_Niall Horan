[Verse 1]
I swear there was lightnin' comin' from your eyes
Startin' a fire in our hotel room
And yeah, we were dancin', dancin' to Bruno
And I couldn't turn away from you
Yeah, I saw you smilin', breakin' the silence
Tellin' me just what you want
There in the moment, I was reminded
I haven't felt this way in a while

[Refrain]
Blinded by the sparks
We were drivin' around in the dark
Findin' reasons to stay where we are

[Chorus]
All of my life, I've been sleepwalk livin'
Runnin' around the same bars I've been in
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me
All of my life, it's been heartbreak weather
Thinkin' to myself, it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it was magic
You were a vision, watchin' the way your body moves
You're takin' your clothes off, you look in the mirror
Tellin' me just what you want

[Refrain]
And I was blinded by the sparks
I was holdin' you close in the dark
Findin' reasons to stay where we are

[Chorus]
All of my life, I've been sleepwalk livin'
Runnin' around the same bars I've been in
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me
All of my life, it's been heartbreak weather
Thinkin' to myself, it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me

[Bridge]
You, that's what I've been missin'
Was tangled up and twisted
Now, all the clouds been lifted
Lately, my heart's been so empty
You, that's what I've been missin'
Was tangled up and twisted
Now, all the clouds been lifted
Lately, my heart's been so empty

[Chorus]
But it feels different when you're with me
It feels different when you're with me
All of my life, it's been heartbreak weather
Thinkin' to myself, it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different when you're with me
It feels different when you're with me
