[Verse 1]
We fight, we get high holdin' on to love
We came down 'cause there was nothing holdin' us
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are?
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart?

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go?
Are your tears falling down when the lights are low?
Another Friday night tryna put on a show
Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'?
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
So, darlin'

[Chorus]
Put a little love on me
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin'
I look around as my heart is collapsin'
'Cause you're the only one I need
To put a little love on me

[Verse 2]
We wrote and we wrote
'Til there were no more words
We laughed and we cried
Until we saw our worst
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are?
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart?

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go?
Are your tears falling down when the lights are low?
Another Friday night tryna put on a show
Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'?
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
Will someone

[Chorus]
Put a little love on me? Ayy
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin'
I look around as my heart is collapsin'
'Cause you're the only one I need
To put a little love on me

[Bridge]
Last night I lay awake
Stuck on the things we say
And when I close my eyes
The first thing I hear you say is

[Chorus]
Put a little love on me, ayy
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up we're the only ones dancing
I look around and you're standing there asking
You say, "You're the only one I need
So put your love on me"

[Outro]
You're the only one I need
Put your love on me
