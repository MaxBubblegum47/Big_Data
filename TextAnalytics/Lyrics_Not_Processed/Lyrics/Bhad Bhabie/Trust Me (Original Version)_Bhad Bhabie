[Intro]
Bobby Kritical

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
I know you gon' be the one that's gon' hold me down
When it's time to put in work you know I'm always 'round
Tote that Glock, hold that work, baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me
Baby, do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
Baby, do you trust me? (skrt, skrt)
Baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
I'ma make you love me, baby, do you trust me?
Come in close and hug me, tell that hoe don't test me
I don't play 'bout mines, watch this shit get messy
Tote that Glock, hide it in my spot
Bitch, stop playing, I'ma leave you hot
Rubber bands wrapped around these knots
Bitch, stop playing, watch me kill the parking lot

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
I know you gon' be the one that's gon' hold me down
When it's time to put in work you know I'm always 'round
Tote that Glock, hold that work, baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me
Baby, do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
Baby, do you trust me? (skrt, skrt)
Baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me

[Interlude: XXXTENTACION]
I feel like going to therapy
And sometimes I be wanting like, to tell my therapist, like, "catch me outside"
Hahahaha
On G, I swear, I swear to god

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Okay, put my heart to the side
In my feelings, ho, let's ride
Big MAC to the side
If she call, I'm gon' slide
"That's my baby boy," you crazy
She might get a new Mercedes
She say she want me, oowee
Okay, lil' shawty, let's do this, uh-huh

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
I know you gon' be the one that's gon' hold me down
When it's time to put in work you know I'm always 'round
Tote that Glock, hold that work, baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me
Baby, do you trust me? Do you trust me?
Baby, do you trust me? (skrt, skrt) Baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me
