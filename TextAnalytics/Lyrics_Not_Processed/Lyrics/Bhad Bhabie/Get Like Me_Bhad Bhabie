[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Bitch, get you some money

Ho, get like me

I ain't never gave a fuck about no bitch
Bitch, get you some money
Bitch, get you some money
Bitch, get you some money
Ho, get like me

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
I'm gettin' a lot, killin' shit, bitches careers gettin' murdered (Murdered)
You be the judge, show me the verdict
I get my money converted
Bitches be running in circles (Circles)
Feel like I'm running a circuit (Circuit)
Rake me up for the commercial
Bands busting through my Birkins (Bitch)
Bitch run up on me, get your shit smacked up
Fucked for the pack, get a pack if you mismatched (Bitch)
Shooting out the Wraith in a pitched back
Slick keep aiming at the scope, couldn't miss that (No)
Ho, you just broke get your money up (Up)
You ain't even got a thousand (Nope)
Sellin' snacks, you need a tummy tuck (Eww)
Bitches really out here wildin' (Nasty bitch)
I got endorsements ready
You're just a corpse, sit steady (Steady)
I'm on the Forbes list stuntin' (Stuntin')
I put the plaques on the wall
I smell the plaque through your jaw
You ain't got nothing, jumping off

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie and 
NLE Choppa

Bitch, get you some money
Bitch, get you some money
Bitch, get you some money
Ho, get like me
Bitch, get you some money
Bitch, get you some money
Bitch, get you some money
Ho, get like me
I ain't never gave a fuck about a broke bitch
I ain't never gave a fuck about no bitch
Bitch, get you some money (
Yeah

Bitch, get you some money (
Fuck the money, NLE

Bitch, get you some money
Ho, get like me (

[Verse 2: NLE Choppa]
Get you some money, I'm countin' up guap (Yeah)
Lean in my tummy, I sip out the bottle (Yeah)
I hopped in the game but you know I'm a problem (Yeah)
Shoot him in the neck, pop him in the collar (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
The route start working, then you know I'm swingin' balls (Let's go)
But I get paid ten bands just to do a show (Yeah, yeah)
Bitch you know that I'm the man when I step up on the scene
I got a hundred somethin' racks poking out my Balmain jeans (Racks, cash, yeah)
He wasn't there when we was down, so he can't join the team (He can't join that)
Don't you run up on me crazy 'cause this Glocky got a beam (It got a beam)
We do this murder shit for real, for my niggas I'll kill
I'll do a hundred years, swear to God I won't squeal
Never change on my gang, never changed for the fame
If I see a bitch ass rapper, I'ma take that nigga chain
Bitch, gang

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie and NLE Choppa]
Bitch, get you some money
Bitch, get you some money
Bitch, get you some money
Ho, get like me
Bitch, get you some money
Bitch, get you some money
Bitch, get you some money
Ho, get like me
I ain't never gave a fuck about a broke bitch
I ain't never gave a fuck about no bitch
Bitch, get you some money

Bitch, get you some money
Ho, get like me
