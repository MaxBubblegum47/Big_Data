[Intro]
Eardrummers

[Chorus]
All the flawless diamonds on my necklace
Hatin' hoes, they never happy
But these bitches gon' respect this
Don't come at me reckless
Pull up on your side if you try to test this
Your pockets anorexic
Hundred-k to pose, bitch you broke
Why you flexin?
These hoes just mad I'm stayin'
Instead of hatin' on me, you should follow my direction

[Verse]
You ride in a foreign or nah?
Have you been tourin or nah?
You ain't been nowhere
You ain't no hair
Bitch, I got money to blow
Hoe, where your fans at?
You know where your mans at?
Try me, I ain't playin' that
Stomp you on right where you're standin' at
Bhad Bhabie in a foreign
14 in a foreign
Thirty bands in my hand
With Gucci nails, I'm important
You still ride in a van
I be ridin' 'round in Porsche's
Might be ridin' in a Lamb
You ain't even left the porch, bitch
My dinner Bossa Nova
Benihana - lunch
Pissy pussy hoe, you gotta eat your mama lunch
Run up on me, get you and your mama punched
Your man heard I got that pool, and I'm like get him dunked
'Cuz I'm living legend
Crib like a palace
I'm really a savage
Bitch, you just average

[Chorus]
All the flawless diamonds on my necklace
Hatin' hoes, they never happy
But these bitches gon' respect this
Don't come at me reckless
Pull up on your side if you try to test this
Your pockets anorexic
Hundred-k to pose, bitch you broke
Why you flexin?
These hoes just mad I'm stayin'
Instead of hatin' on me, you should follow my direction
