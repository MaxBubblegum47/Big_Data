[Intro]
30, you a fool for this one
Oh lord, Jetson made another one!

[Chorus]
I'm getting endless distractions from annoying bitches
They’ve been acting like shit ever since I said hello to them
My teachers are tryna fuck these endless distractions, it isn't working
Fuck the, fuck the, fuck the
Endless distractions

[Verse 1]
I once told 30 I had 90 bitches tryna fuck me in the face
Jetson gets me to my place without these annoying shitfaces (Okay)
Ho, had enough
Been out to Paris with stupid hoes tryna get me down
I don't love it, I won’t take it either, okay, okay

[Chorus]
I'm getting endless distractions from annoying bitches
They've been acting like shit ever since I said hello to them
My teachers are tryna fuck these endless distractions, it isn't working
Fuck the, fuck the, fuck the
Endless distractions

[Verse 2]
Whoa, just dropped out from high school
Bust it up, fuck these couches and sofas with crumbs all over them (Uh)
My bedroom already smells like a bitch made a mess in there
My mom and dad are on thin ice, they haven't been watching for intruders
Yeah, yuh

[Chorus]
I'm getting endless distractions from annoying bitches
They've been acting like shit ever since I said hello to them
My teachers are tryna fuck these endless distractions, it isn't working
Fuck the, fuck the, fuck the
Endless distractions

[Outro]
Fuck the, fuck the, fuck the
Endless distractions
