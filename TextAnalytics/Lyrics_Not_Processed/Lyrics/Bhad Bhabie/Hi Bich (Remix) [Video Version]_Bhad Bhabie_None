[Intro]
Oh my God, Ronny

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
I do not sniff it or roll it (no)
It do not drip when I pour it (no)
I do not run, I reload it
I do not save it, I throw it
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch

[Verse 1: MadeInTYO]
Yuh, Prada my T when I pop out, huh
Racks in my pockets, I stand out (yea)
You a dub, I'm the man now (skrr-skrr)
Hi bitch, never needed a hand out
Louis Vuitton, I do sandals (shit)
Couple of racks, doing good (racks)
Watch how she rub on my wood, (ew)
I know a thottie she would, ooh
She wanna hear that New Freezer, huh
Spanish bitch, yeah, mamacita, huh
Take a bitch to Costa Rica, huh
Hi Bich blowing out your speakers, huh
Private, Chanel on my eyelids
Got a bad bitch, don't try it (skrr-skrr)
Yeah, I take her to the island (sauce)
Phone on silent (racks)
Got the racks and I'm vibin' (brrr)
Need the Rollie with the diamonds (racks)
Check out, perfect timing (bling blaow)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid & Bhad Bhabie]
Ayy, ayy (hi, bitch, rich)
She ain't got FaceTime, I'ma Skype it (what?)
Get her head one time, tell her, "Bye, bitch" (bitch)
Drop an all white Bentley on my right wrist
I might take her on the jet if I like it (woah)
Side bitch, Kylie
If I dick her one time, what she gon' buy me? (buy me)
Come straight out the sky like I'm E.T
Fuck that, bitch, my pinky ring 3D (ice)
Young CEO, I could sign ya
Quarter mil' on my neck, I'ma blind ya (woah)
Cut her off, she ain't havin' no purpose
Bitch bad, still buyin' no purses (hell no)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch

[Verse 3: Asian Doll]
Bitches deceased
Smokin' on dick, she not better than me
Pop out, lil' birdie, you speak with a beak
Send your location, then Uber to me
Bitches been hangin' diamonds on my face
Kick her to the curb, she ain't gang anyway
Asian on the beat then the beat gets slayed
I took it offensive, so watch what you say
Hi, bitch, got a .30, don't try it
Ball out the mall, I'm like Kobe, just buy shit
Sick of these bitches, they lie quick
Clip shoot a movie, now talkers, directors, you dyin'
Send her ass on a hike
I don't wanna kick it with her, bitch for the hype
Real pretty, beat her ass in a street fight
Know I'm flyer than these hoes like a pink kite, Asian Doll!

[Interlude: Bhad Bhabie]
Bitch!
You mad, ho
Why you so mad, ho?

[Verse 4: Bhad Bhabie]
Ho don't want no drama, commas, no commas
Commas run on 10, since I run it up
Never wanna line up, I don't do McDonald's
Fuck crazy you know I'm breakin' necks when I'm pullin' up (skrrt)
All my numbers lookin' outrageous
Now the blogs handin' out praises
Got the world usin' my phrases
Hoes keep my name in their mouth
Hope it tastes like shit when they say it (don't say my name, bitch)
Barrin' out, I ain't got Xans in me, no
Young but I'm ballin' like a damn CEO
Bentley truck, said don't give a fuck
Came from the street, Boynton Beach
Yeah, they know what's up
Bitches that hold no position, come at me, fall in my mentions
Hoes be thirsty for attention, knock a ho out this dimension
Then continue my ascension (why you so mad?)
How you hoes livin' with no purpose?
I be pumpin' venom in my verses
Bitch, you worthless, you ain't fuckin' with my worst shit
Doubted me, now it's all comin' together like cursive (like cursive, bitch)
$50K a show, I'm doin' 30 of 'em
5 million by the summer, keep the numbers runnin'
Bitches showin' everything, I be understuntin' (damn)
Understand, a year ago I really had nothing' (shit)
Shit, but now I'm breakin' records and I'm makin' history (wow)
How can they stop me? I swear it's a mystery
Parents so sick of me, source of their misery
(Let your kids listen to me!)
Ho, I do a million views on a slow day
And I ain't gotta go to school like a snow day
But my... in the stu' so it's okay, bank account look like a lick
Broke ho, you look like you sick, slide on the beat like it's slick
Bitch don't compare me to Iggy, that old ho is washed and I'm lit
Wouldn't pay her to wash up my whip (bye, broke bitch, bye, ho!)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
I do not sniff it or roll it (no)
It do not drip when I pour it (no)
I do not run, I reload it
I do not save it, I throw it
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
