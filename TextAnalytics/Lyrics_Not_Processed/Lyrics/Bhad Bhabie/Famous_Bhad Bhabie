[Chorus]
Wanna love me, 'cause I’m famous (famous)
Wanna try me, 'cause I'm famous (famous)
Whole world knowin’ what my name is (what my name is)
Run up on me, could be dangerous (dangerous)
Hear em whisperin', 'cause I'm famous (famous)
Takin' pictures, 'cause I'm famous
I ain't budging, I ain’t changin’
It don't matter that I’m famous (famous)

[Verse 1]
They don't tell me no (no)
No red lights I'm on go (I'm on go)
Anything that I want (I want)
I can get it pronto (I get it)
I ain’t got no friends (no friends)
Everyone's on payroll
Charge it all to the game (game)
Stay strong won't fold
They love me then they hate me, then they love me again (haters)
First they diss my career then beg for a verse in DMs (why you comin' back?)
First a Bentley then a coupe then I went back to the Benz (back to the Benz)
The internet, it want me gone because of all my sins (all of my sins)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's controversy (controversy)
Over every single thing that I say (everything that I say)
Wanted me to stay up in a child's place (child's place)
But I just put the down payment on my own place (fuck is you sayin', lil' bitch?)

[Chorus]
Wanna love me, 'cause I'm famous ('cause I'm famous)
Wanna try me, 'cause I'm famous (don't care, ho)
Whole world knowin' what my name is (what my name is)
Run up on me, could be dangerous (could be dangerous)
Hear em whisperin' 'cause I'm famous ('cause I'm famous)
Takin' pictures, 'cause I'm famous ('cause I'm famous)
I ain't budging, I ain't changin' (I ain't changin')
It don't matter that I'm famous
Wanna love me, 'cause I'm famous ('cause I'm famous)
Wanna try me, 'cause I'm famous (don't care, ho)
Whole world knowin' what my name is (what my name is)
Run up on me, could be dangerous (could be dangerous)
Hear em whisperin' 'cause I'm famous ('cause I'm famous)
Takin' pictures, 'cause I'm famous ('cause I'm famous)
I ain't budging, I ain't changin' (I ain't changin')
It don't matter that I'm famous

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go, they screaming "Bhad Bhabie" (Bhad Bhabie)
If I see a hatin' ho, she a mad baby (she a mad bitch)
See yo bitch, I know she a fan (she a fan)
Runnin' up, bouta get these hands (hands)
See the guap in between the bands (bands)
See this Porsche in between the Benz
I don't wanna take a pic sometime
Let me do me sometimes (let me live)
Got my name all in fake news
Wanna know who I'm talking to
Wanna know if my mom bought a crib (nope)
Ask if she got a P.O. too (nope)
They follow my every move (nope)
What that shit gotta do with you?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's controversy (controversy)
Over every single thing that I say (everything that I say)
Wanted me to stay up in a child's place (child's place)
But I just put the down payment on my own place (fuck is you sayin', lil bitch?)

[Chorus]
Wanna love me, 'cause I'm famous ('cause I'm famous)
Wanna try me, 'cause I'm famous (don't care, ho)
Whole world knowin' what my name is (what my name is)
Run up on me, could be dangerous (could be dangerous)
