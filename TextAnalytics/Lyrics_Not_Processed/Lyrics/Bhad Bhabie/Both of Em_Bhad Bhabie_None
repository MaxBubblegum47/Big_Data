[Chorus]
Hear 'em talking shit
I take both of 'em
Your exes on my dick
I take both of 'em
Bentley truck, Panamera
I own both of 'em
Young and rich in the mirror
I see both of 'em

[Verse 1]
From the courtroom to fame and fortune
Yeah, I see both of 'em
Tallahassee and Calabasas
Got cribs in both of 'em
Did this shit all on my own so
I don't owe nothing
Call Rihanna and Ariana
Yeah, I know both of 'em
Got two phones like I'm Kevin Gates
I give bitches both numbers
Just like Buddens and Charlemagnes
No one cares 'bout both of 'em
It's a hundred degrees out on my wrist
It's a cold summer
It's a hundred degrees out on my wrist
It's a cold summer

[Chorus]
Hear 'em talking shit
I take both of 'em
Your exes on my dick
I take both of 'em
Bentley truck, Panamera
I own both of 'em
Young and rich in the mirror
I see both of 'em
Both of 'em, both
Both of 'em
Bentley truck, Panamera
I own both of 'em
Young and rich in the mirror
I see both of 'em

[Verse 2]
Chevy candy coated
And the matte floorin'
Lil baby, cherry red
And the other golden
Everybody on my Gram since I went public
Don't be callin' me fam
No we not cousins
Find her with my body guard
No I don't tote nothing
I ain't snitchin' to the troll
No, I don't know nothin'
Took the number one spot
They act like I done stole something
Ugly and you washed up
Yeah, bitch, you both of 'em
(Bitch, you both of 'em)

[Chorus]
Hear 'em talking shit
I take both of 'em
Your exes on my dick
I take both of 'em
Bentley truck, Panamera
I own both of 'em
Young and rich in the mirror
I see both of 'em
Both of 'em, both
Both of 'em
Bentley truck, Panamera
I own both of 'em
Young and rich in the mirror
I see both of 'em
