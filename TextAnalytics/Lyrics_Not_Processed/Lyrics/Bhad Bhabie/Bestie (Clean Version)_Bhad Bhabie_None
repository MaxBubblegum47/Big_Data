Ayy, shorty, she gon' ride, she gon' die for me
Yeah, I know all my ******, they gon' slide for me
I be goin' up when you goin' down on me
When I come through, I got the four pound on me
Every time I'm on the scene, I be toolied up
When you comin' through our city, put your jewellery up
In a dually truck, Doo-Doo got his toolie tucked

Go Kodak, go Kodak, get money

Go Kodak, go Kodak, get money

Pull up to the party, I got everybody lit

Double dutching with the money, I be playin' with the bands

Every time we pull up, ******* pissed off (Pissed off)
Make the whole club jump like Kris Kross (Kris Kross)

We be blowin' money fast like Rick Ross (Rick Ross)
