[Intro]
Pooh, you a fool for this one
Go, Grizz
Alright, yeah, let's do it
Winner's Circle

[Chorus]
That's what I said
I put a bitch in her place, smoosh a lil' bitch in the face
That's what I said
I got a grip in the safe, no, I ain't fearing no case
That's what I said
I don't trust none of you bitches, don't fuck with none of you bitches
That's what I said
Ashin' my blunt on you bitches, you want the smoke? Well, I'm with it
That's what I said
You on my nerves, you could get served, fuck what you heard
That's what I said
I'm with this shit, 'bout what I say, I say my word
That's what I said
I don't trust none of you bitches, don't fuck with none of you bitches
That's what I said
Ashin' my blunt on you bitches, you want the smoke? Well, I'm with it
That's what I said

[Verse]
Talking shit from your mama house
But get quiet when I come see what that pressure 'bout
Bitches worry 'bout these dudes that be sharing hoes
Popping shit under my comments but be sharing clothes
Not with all that fake shit, don't come through, no, "Hey, sis"
You lost, you misplaced, bitch, buggin' me, you get sprayed, bitch
All these hundreds, I be countin' for days
Still with it, I ain't duckin' a fade
Ain't showing if I ain't getting paid
Bitches scary but they saying my name

[Chorus]
That's what I said
I put a bitch in her place, smoosh a lil' bitch in the face
That's what I said
I got a grip in the safe, no, I ain't fearing no case
That's what I said
I don't trust none of you bitches, don't fuck with none of you bitches
That's what I said
Ashin' my blunt on you bitches, you want the smoke? Well, I'm with it
That's what I said
You on my nerves, you could get served, fuck what you heard
That's what I said
I'm with this shit, 'bout what I say, I say my word
That's what I said
I don't trust none of you bitches, don't fuck with none of you bitches
That's what I said
Ashin' my blunt on you bitches, you want the smoke? Well, I'm with it
That's what I said
