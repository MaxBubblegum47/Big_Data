[Chorus]
Bring me all the money, bring me all the racks in
Give me all the money, bring me all the racks in
Make my own money, but I'd rather spend yours
Got my own hundreds, but I'd rather spend yours
Give me all the money, bring me all the racks in
Give me all the money, bring me all the racks in
Make my own money, but I'd rather spend yours
Got my own hundreds, but I'd rather spend yours

[Verse]
So you the bitch that keep calling his phone? (hello)
You can never take my place so leave his ass alone (hahahahaha)
Mad hoes always talking shit, like, "Ooh, she think she grown"
Play about my name, you bitches end up gettin' blown (bitch)
Blow the bag now we stunt like an actress
Made a play, went and put up my lashes
[?] Patek, water cool like [?]
This AP shinin' bright like a [?]
I don't be hearin' that, bitch, I need all of that
I just ran through it, I can't get [?]
[?] keep me a [?]
[?]
You need a bit (sit)
Fuck us a big (bitch)
You should be callinâ€™ it quits (quits)
I'm with the six (six)
I'm young and I'm rich
Might take a trip (trip)
AP [?] money [?]
Click, click

[Chorus]
Bring me all the money, bring me all the racks in
Give me all the money, bring me all the racks in
Make my own money, but I'd rather spend yours
Got my own hundreds, but I'd rather spend yours
Give me all the money, bring me all the racks in
Give me all the money, bring me all the racks in
Make my own money, but I'd rather spend yours
Got my own hundreds, but I'd rather spend yours
