[Chorus 1: Asian Doll]
Bitch watch yo mouth, don’t want no beef, you ain’t affiliated (hell nah)
Ain’t getting no money, ain’t talking that bag, then we can’t build relations (relations)
I went to sleep and woke up rich, I had to chase the paper (bands)
I’m taking spots where the cops can’t do no bitch no fucking favors (what the fuck?)
These bitches be dumb (uh), these bitches not affiliated (yeah)
Hundred on my drum (hundred), my niggas all affiliated (gang)
These girls my sons (sons), I made that ho ain’t got no apron (bitch)
On sight don’t run (what), I’m sorry, this how savage raised me (aye)

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
Play if you want, try me I’ll get violated
Fuck that charge, and fuck them cases
I hit first, ain’t got no patience
Gimmie mine, bitch I ain’t waiting
This life real, no time for faking
It’s in my blood, the streets that’s where I graduated
When I go on tour, my shit sold out, I’m still hood though
What you waiting for, wanna run up, wish you would though
I gotta get more, I got my pedal to the floor
Yeah I’ll mop up all you bitches, like I’m atcha doing chores (bitch)

[Chorus 2: Bhad Bhabie]
Bitch watch yo mouth, don’t want no beef, you ain’t affiliated
Ain’t getting no money, ain’t talking that bag, then we can’t build relations
I went to sleep and woke up rich, I had to chase the paper
I’m from the streets where the cops can’t do no bitch no fucking favors
These bitches be dumb, these bitches ain't affiliated
Hundred on my drum, my bitches all affiliated
These hoes my sons, I made that ho ain’t got no apron
On sight don’t run, ain’t sorry, this how Boynton raised me

[Verse 2: Asian Doll]
This how savage raised me, so I had to run my bands up (bands)
He like how I’m popping shit, I might just hit his mans up (mans)
Haters I’m not walking with, these bitches they can’t stand us (what, what)
Blowing Cantaloupe, I’m smoking dope, can’t catch no cancer
Heart attack, bitches see me running shit, I’m on yo ass
No cartin' back, ain’t no back and front with me the doll, yeah 'cause I started that (started that bitch)
Go against the princess out of luck, ain’t got no heart attached
All my bitches ride, homicide, reload the semi strap

[Chorus 3: Bhad Bhabie, Asian Doll, Both]
Bitch watch yo mouth, don’t want no beef, you ain’t affiliated (hell nah)
Ain’t getting no money, ain’t talking that bag, then we can’t build relations (relations)
I went to sleep and woke up rich, I had to chase the paper (bands)
I’m (from the streets) (taking spots) where the cops can’t do no bitch no fucking favors (what the fuck?)
These bitches be dumb (uh), these bitches (not) (ain't) affiliated (yeah)
Hundred on my drum (hundred), my bitches all affiliated (gang)
These (hoes) (girls) my sons (sons), I made that ho ain’t got no apron (bitch)
