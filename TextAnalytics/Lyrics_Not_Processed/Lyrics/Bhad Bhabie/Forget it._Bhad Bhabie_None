[Intro]
Pooh, you a fool for this one
Oh lord, Jetson made another one!
I.Trez on the track

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
Whoa, the fuck, I've had enough, bitch
You deserve to get punched in the face
You're nothing like my baby, you're just a bad bitch
You just talking shit, you're like nothing, unimportant

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
You ain't the one for me, forget it, bitch
You ain't the one for me, forget it, bitch
You ain't the one for me, forget it, bitch
I haven't had enough, actually, I had way more than enough, bitch!

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Just got a brand-new Gucci Wrangler
Gucci and me went out to the fucking restaurant
Yea, yea, just got some garlic bread with Gucci toppings
Uh-huh, yeah, and you're the one interrupting it, nigga

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
You ain't the one for me, forget it, bitch
You ain't the one for me, forget it, bitch
You ain't the one for me, forget it, bitch
I haven't had enough, actually, I had way more than enough, bitch!

[Outro: Bhad Bhabie]
Hi-yah!
