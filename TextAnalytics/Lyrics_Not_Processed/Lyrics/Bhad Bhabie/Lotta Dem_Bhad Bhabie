Hoes tryna hate, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem

Lotta, lotta 'dem, lotta, lotta 'dem)

[Verse 1]
Ain't shit, new shit, spaceship, coupe shit
Came with two whips, déjà vu shit
Still got a lotta them bands (Bands)
Still got a lotta them mad (Mad)
Old bread, new drip, fake hoes, new tits
They call, who this? Fake lips sink ships
Still got a lotta them bands (Bands, bitch)
Still got a lotta them mad (Mad, bitch)
Yeah, you can drop it but it ain't gon' sell (Sell)
My shit hittin' like the NFL (Ho)
Tinted 9-11 so I don't see 12 (Nope)
Stay with the K so I don't take L's (Bitch)

[Chorus]
M's in the bank, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem)
Stones on the chain, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem)
Hoes tryna hate, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem
Lotta, lotta 'dem, lotta, lotta 'dem)
Cribs by the lake, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem)
Friends actin' fake, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem)
Lies on my name, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem
Lotta, lotta 'dem, lotta, lotta 'dem)

[Verse 2]
Young bitch, rich bitch, rude bitch, new bitch
AK, two clips, same gang, who switched?
Still got a lotta them bands (Bands, bitch)
Still got a lotta them mad (Mad, ho)
You a dub, bitch, dumb bitch, old bitch, ho bitch
No bitch, ​broke bitch, stay back, no flicks (No flicks)
Just got a crib for the fam (Bitch)
Still tell the jet when to land (Land, bitch)
Still choke a bitch like MMA
Sellin' out arenas like the NBA (Bitch)
Can't tell me shit like an NDA
Tell the Forbes List that I'm on my way (On my way)

[Chorus]
M's in the bank, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem)
Stones on the chain, got a (Lotta lotta 'dem)
Hoes tryna hate, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem

Cribs by the lake, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem)
Friends actin' fake, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem)
Lies on my name, got a (Lotta, lotta 'dem
Lotta, lotta 'dem, lotta, lotta 'dem)
