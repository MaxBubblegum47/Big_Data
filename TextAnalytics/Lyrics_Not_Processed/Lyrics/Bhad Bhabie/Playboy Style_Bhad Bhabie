[Intro: Charli XCX & Bhad Bhabie]
Uh, oh damn
Uh, uh, oh damn
It's Clean Bandit
With Charli XCX and Bhad Bhabie, bitch

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Had a lover undercover, kept it on the low
Said that you meant nothing but my feelings really grew
Not that I regret you but I met you, went insane
Oh, oh, yeah
Didn't need forever but I needed just a call
Every night at 3 A.M I'm banging on your door
Crying on the marble where we used to fuck 'til dawn
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
What're you doing to me?
Used to be a scene from a movie
Now I'm crying tears like a baby
Looking in the mirror, I don't know me
Oh, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Fell in love with a bad, bad dude
Playboy style, should've seen right through
All my friends, they could see the truth
You never loved me, you never loved me, yeah yeah
It's so rare for a girl like me
Playboy style, got me fallin' deep
Did that dirt and I got receipts
You never loved me, you never loved me, yeah yeah

[Post Chorus: Charli XCX]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, La-la-la-la-a
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, La-la-la-la-a

[Verse 2: Bhad Bhabie & Charli XCX]
When you making checks on checks
They chase you for that dollar bill (What a bitch)
But where the fuck was you
When all I had to eat was dollar meals? (Where was you at?)
Thought we'd have a run, boy
Thought you was the one, boy
But as I'm growing older, wiser, I don't want no young boys (Oh no)
Too many on me and I don't discriminate (Nope)
Might take that bitch on a dinner date (Eat yo pussy)
Fashion Nova, new collection (Bitch)
Already on me, I don't gotta wait (Oh, you mad)
Gotta treat me like a lady (Like a lady)
But I'm still a bhad bhabie (Lady)
I'm ignoring texts on texts
I'm sorry it's Bhabie with XCX
Yeah yeah

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Fell in love with a bad, bad dude
Playboy style, should've seen right through
All my friends, they could see the truth
You never loved me, you never loved me, yeah yeah
It's so rare for a girl like me
Playboy style, got me fallin' deep
Did that dirt and I got receipts
You never loved me, you never loved me, yeah yeah

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
Yeah, you said no one was home
Too bad he's making shapes with the lights on
I hope she's what you want, uh
Can't believe I let a Playboy play me so damn good
Teardrops down the counter from the girls from Hollywood
Kiss him better, then you leave him, then you hide the truth
Oh, oh, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Fell in love with a bad, bad dude
Playboy style, should've seen right through
All my friends, they could see the truth
You never loved me, you never loved me, yeah yeah
It's so rare for a girl like me
Playboy style, got me fallin' deep
Did that dirt and I got receipts
You never loved me, you never loved me, yeah yeah

[Outro: Charli XCX]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, La-la-la-la-a
Uh, uh, oh damn
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, La-la-la-la-a
