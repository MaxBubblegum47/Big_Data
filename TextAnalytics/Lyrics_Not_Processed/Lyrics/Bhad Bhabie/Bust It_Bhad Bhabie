[Verse]
If you ain´t got a [?]
Got a whole lot of cash
Can I hit it?
Do a whole five bands in a minute
And the bankroll just keep going up
AP on my wrist, give me more luck
She wanna see how the Maybach cruise
I say, “yeah like a bitch won't lose”
Pop out wit' a bag full of blues
Hundred bands, who you gon' choose?
She gonna eat the pussy like tiramisu
Bring a few friends and we can make moves, yeah

[Chorus]
Give it to me, turn around
All that ass can't turn it down
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Give it to me, turn around
All these bands can't turn it down
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
