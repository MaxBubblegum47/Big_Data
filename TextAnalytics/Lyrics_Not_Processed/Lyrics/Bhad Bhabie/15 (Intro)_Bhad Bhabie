[Verse 1]
My fifteen minutes stretching some hours late
Bring me fifteen bitches, I'll make 'em salivate
Fifteen million right on my fuckin' plate
BOA
, fifteen hundred just to feast safe
Fifteen, feeling like I won a sweepstakes
Fifteen-hour flights when I leave the states
Fifteen thousand dollars on a bracelet
Had to buy two, I had the jeweler going 
apeshit
Old friends doing fifteen to life
I changed my situation with some pristine advice
Name a rapper hot as me, I'm fifteen times the hype
My bank account holds fifteen times your life
Fifteen cars like I'm collecting those
Fifteen Fashion Nova packs, I'm collecting clothes
Fan love 'cross the map, getting X and Os
Fifteen bodyguards in my section, closed

[Chorus]
Fifteen, fifteen, rose up from the depths, now I live a dream
Fifteen, fifteen, making history, this shit something they never seen

[Verse 2]
Fifteen bad bitches, send a UberX
Fifteen bitches mad I get uber checks
Fifteen hunned Bhabies by the mosh pit
Rap star, living life for my rock shit
Like a pop shift, fifteen in the Glock, bitch
Think you hot shit? Get you fifteen knots, quick
That's a lump sum, sweaty bitches Trump dumb
Fifteen shots to that head, I get 'em punch drunk
Fifteen milli' stalking that IG
So why in the fuck would I need a ID?
Hoes looking thirsty, get on my IV
Voice of the new generation, you can't deny me
Tape dropping September, I hope you hoes ready
Fifteen, Black Mamba, shit gon' be so deadly
(
Tape dropping September, I hope you hoes ready
Bust fifteen tons, this shit is so heavy)

[Chorus]
Fifteen, fifteen, rose up from the depths, now I live a dream
Fifteen, fifteen, making history, this shit something they never seen
