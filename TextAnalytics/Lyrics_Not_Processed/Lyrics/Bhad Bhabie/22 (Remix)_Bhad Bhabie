[Chorus: Lil Candy Paint]
She havin' deep thought, and I can see it
Everything that I say, know I mean it
Said "I love you", just believe it
I hate it when we argue for no reason
Pourin' up that cup, I think I'm drinkin'
I'm pourin' up for nothin', think I'm fiendin'
She goin' out for nothin', think I'm cheatin'
I can't blame lil baby, I'm a demon

[Verse 1: Lil Candy Paint]
We out and order Sprite and put Codeine in it
But she don't like that shit when I be ignorant
I'm pourin' up the pint what you had spent on rent
If she don't like her ass then we fixin' it
Hop out X6 twin-turbo, big as shit
My bitch bad and she boujee and she Snicker thick
Nigga tryna pluck 20 'till we split his wig
You could try to try my bitch, but you ain't gettin' shit
You niggas dancin' for my ho
I keep checkin' on my ho
I ain't never stressin' on my ho
I count these backends with my ho
You be actin' for your ho
You'll get slapped in front of your ho
I can't believe these jokes
Nigga dapped me up sayin' bro
Then try to talk to my ho
But we ain't stressin' anything
It's still purple everything
It's still purple everything

[Verse 2: Bhad Bhabie]
Blowing up his phone, I know I’m tripping for no reason
He gon’ call it crazy, but I say I call it feening
He don’t want no other ho’s ‘cause then this shit too easy
Know I talk a lot of shit, but he know I don’t mean it
They gon' say I'm tripping, but I got a hundred reasons
One hundred fucking reasons, I’m never ever leaving
Nope, I ain’t leaving
Even if we ain’t speaking
And if we ain’t speaking, you know Ima be pleakin'
Real bitch, I ain’t nothing like these groupie ho’s
Nothing like these bitches sitting front row at your fucking shows
He need him a real one, suck him make him feel summin’
I know I ain’t tripping man I bet you I might kill some
(Yeah) Kill some, fuck it (Yeah) drill summin’
Make [?] still cum ‘cause I make him feel summin’
Yeah, feel summin', feel summin'
This lil’ [...], swear to God it make him feel numb
