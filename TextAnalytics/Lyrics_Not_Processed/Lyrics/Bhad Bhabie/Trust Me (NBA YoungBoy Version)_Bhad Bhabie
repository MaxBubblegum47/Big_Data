[Intro]
Bobby Kritical

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
I know you gon' be the one that’s gon' hold me down (Down)
When it's time to put in work you know I’m always 'round ('Round)
Tote that Glock, hold that work, baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me (Love me, love me)
Baby, do you trust me? Do you trust me?
Baby, do you trust me? (Trust me, skrrt, skrrt) Baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me (Love me, love me)

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
I'ma make you love me, baby, do you trust me?
Come in close and hug me (Hug me), tell that hoe don't test me
I don't play ’bout mines, watch this shit get messy
Tote that Glock (Glock), hide it in my spot
Bitch, stop playing, I’ma leave you hot
Rubber bands wrapped around these knots
Bitch, stop playing, watch me kill the parking lot

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
I know you gon' be the one that’s gon' hold me down (Down)
When it's time to put in work you know I'm always ’round ('Round)
Tote that Glock, hold that work, baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me (Love me, love me)
Baby, do you trust me? Do you trust me?
Baby, do you trust me? (Trust me, skrrt, skrrt) Baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me (Love me, love me)

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Put your pride to the side, tell me, do you trust me?
Swear you got me hypnotized the way you kiss and hug me
You can say what's on your mind, you ain't gotta thug me (Yeah)
L-O-V-E, tell me, do you love me?
Go, know down, know how we living
Chasing that money, you know how we get it
Get it and flip it, we run up them Benzes
I come from the trenches, I stay with a Glizzy
Speak for myself, they don't like how we kick it
They say we won't make it, but fuck 'em, we did it
Tell you I love it, I say that, I meant it
Whenever you talk, you know I'ma listen

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
I know you gon' be the one that's gon' hold me down (Down)
When it's time to put in work you know I'm always 'round ('Round)
Tote that Glock, hold that work, baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me (Love me, love me)
Baby, do you trust me? Do you trust me?
Baby, do you trust me? (Trust me, skrrt, skrrt) Baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me (Love me, love me)
Baby, do you trust me? Do you trust me?
Baby, do you trust me? Baby, do you trust me?
Got the streets in a lock, I'ma make you love me
