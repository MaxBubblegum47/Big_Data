[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm 'bout that
Bitch, I'm 'bout that
Bitch, I'm 'bout that shit
Bitch, I'm 'bout that
You a scary ho, but you won't fight me though (never)
You a copycat, but you ain't like me, ho
Bitch, I'm 'bout that
Bitch, I'm 'bout that
Bitch, I'm 'bout that shit, bitch
Bitch, I'm 'bout that
You a scary ho, but you won't fight me though
You a copycat, but you ain't like me, ho (scary bitch)

[Verse]
Came out with no earrings on
I'll pop the house, my shoes off
In my driveway with that tough talk (ya talkin' shit)
Chase ya ass, slice ya ass, get ya hauled off
Fuck it, I'ma run up on that bitch
Bentley truck (like I'm Future), I'ma run over that bitch (skrr)
Come at her raw, ain't got no rubber for bitches
I'm on her head, I snatch a wig off you bitches ('cause you bald)
This that pay-per-view
If you fight me ho, then you get hella views
I'ma beat yo' ass, then put up an ad
Then I'm postin' that, that's a hundred racks

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm 'bout that
Bitch I'm 'bout that
Bitch I'm 'bout that shit
Bitch I'm 'bout that
You a scary ho, but you won't fight me though (never)
You a copycat, but you ain't like me ho
Bitch I'm 'bout that
Bitch I'm 'bout that
Bitch I'm 'bout that shit, bitch
Bitch I'm 'bout that
You a scary ho, but you won't fight me though
You a copycat, but you ain't like me ho (scary bitch)
