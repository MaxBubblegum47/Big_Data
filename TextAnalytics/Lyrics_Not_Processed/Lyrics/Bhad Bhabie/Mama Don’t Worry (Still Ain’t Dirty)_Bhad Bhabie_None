[Intro]
DJ Chose
I was out there on the hustle
I know you remember me
No more sleeping on the floor
I got some money finally
Mama don't worry, mama don't worry
I did all this dirt and still ain't dirty

[Hook]
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
Baby, I'm outchea so don't worry
I'm in the field without no jersey
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
I came through, popped up on the first day
She say she love me 'cause I'm worthy
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty

[Verse 1]
11 years old I was sitting on the block
Yeah, my family had a little so I hid it in my sock
Sold them pills like they was Skittles, yeah, I always made a lot
I was always dodging 12, putting work in off the clock
Almost got cuffed, it was too much, it was a lot of drama
It was the streets that raising me, had to be dad and mama
I was young, head strong, wasn't letting up
Disrespectful my demeanor, didn't know who to trust

[Pre-Hook]
Now my mama straight, I ain't gotta push no weight
I came from the dirt, now I'm living great
Said I won't gone make it, look how hard they hated
Never had enough and now the bank, we break it
(We break it, bitch)

[Hook]
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
Baby, I'm outchea so don't worry
I'm in the field without no jersey
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
I came through, popped up on the first day
She say she love me 'cause I'm worthy
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty

[Verse 2]
Escaped the belly of the beast without a stain on me
Ready for fighting and my fist has got that ring on it
Boynton Beach out to the hills, how far I came from it
Now the whole world sneaking pictures for the fame of it
Reckless on that show, man that's old news
120 on that ranch, on my own two
I did that crime, I beat that case, kept paying my dues
I did my time, I made them wait, and now I can't lose

[Pre-Hook]
Now my mama straight, I ain't gotta push no weight
I came from the dirt, now I'm living great
Said I won't gone make it, look how hard they hated
Never had enough and now the bank, we break it
(We break it, bitch)

[Hook]
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
Baby, I'm outchea so don't worry
I'm in the field without no jersey
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
I came through, popped up on the first day
She say she love me 'cause I'm worthy
Did all this dirt and still ain't dirty
