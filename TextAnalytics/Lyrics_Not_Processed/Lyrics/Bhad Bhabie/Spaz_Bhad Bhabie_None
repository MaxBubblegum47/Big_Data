[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
Say I was broke, now that lil' boy up now (Up now)
All the girls, they gon' flock when I touch down (Gang)
Flip guns, so I'm gettin' hella bucks now (Hella bucks now)
No lil' Jeep, but this watch got me bust down (S-O-B, nigga)
Two cups, I pass it to my lil' bro (Lil' bro)
I'm the plug, so a nigga got two phones (Two phones)
I got clout, so it's mando', I can't move wrong (I can't move wrong)
I made my time, lil' bitch, it's been too long (It's been too long)
Ayy, baby bring it back for a real P (A real P)
I ain't never run from shit, I'ma real G (On my mama)
Say this rapper shit gon' work, and it saved me (Gang)
Got the .40 in my bubble like I'm JAY-Z  (Graa-bow-bow-bow-bow)
Say I'm smooth, but I bounce out real quick (Real quick, ayy)
A nigga play with me, he catch two clips (Gang)
Ayy, Dani in the cut, she say "Hi Bich" (She say "Hi Bich")
If you talkin' to the feds you gon' die, bitch (Gang)
That's on my mama, on my mama, like I'm TO (Like I'm TO)
I'm the man with them bands, I got big rolls (Gang)
And I'm still screamin', "Free my nigga, Cheeso!" (Free my niggas)
I'ma screams it 'til they let my nigga leave home ('Til they let 'em free)

[Pre-Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Spaz (Gang), all my niggas gon' spaz (They gon' spaz)

[Verse 2: Bhad Bhabie]
They said I only get 15 and then I'm over (Still here, bitch!)
It's been a year and a half, and bitch, I'm still goin'
It's been a mill and a half and I'm still blowin' (Goin')
Got a guard on my left, but I'm still totin'
Never been a bitch (No!) Will never be no snitch (Never!)
If I don't like a bitch she better duck and dip (Bye bitch!)
On probation but I'm still 'bout dat life ('Bout dat shit)
Left that Uzi but I still got dat knife (I'll cut a bitch)
Stevie Wonder, I got bitches on sight (They on sight)
Wanna pic just to boost up your likes? (You want some clout, bitch?)
You can't read, tellin' me I don't write?
Call Nahmir, he gon' end your whole life (Bitch I'm done)
Run it up, run it up, run that check up, lil' bitch
Count it up, count it up count yo checks up lil' bitch
Hunnids up bet you won't, I said "Fuck you, lil' bitch
Fuck you, lil' bitch, ayy" (Fuck you, bitch, ayy)

[Pre-Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Spaz (Gang), all my niggas gon' spaz (They gon' spaz)
