D.A. got that dope!

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Go bitch, go bitch, go bestie
Can't fuck with these hoes 'cause they messy
Go bitch, go bitch, go bestie
Can't fuck with these hoes 'cause they messy
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Ayy, shorty, she gon' ride, she gon' die for me
Yeah, I know all my niggas, they gon' slide for me
I be goin' up when you goin' down on me
When I come through, I got the four pound on me
Every time I'm on the scene, I be toolied up
When you comin' through our city, put your jewelry up
In a dually truck, Doo-Doo got his toolie tucked
I love my baby, you can't talk to her, she rude as fuck
Go Kodak, go Kodak, get money
I don't fuck with rap niggas, they funny
Go Kodak, go Kodak, get money
I don't fuck with rap niggas, they funny

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Go bitch, go bitch, go bestie (Go bestie)
Can't fuck with these hoes 'cause they messy
Go bitch, go bitch, go bestie (Go B)
Can't fuck with these hoes 'cause they messy
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend
That my what? That my muhfuckin' best friend

[Verse 2: Bhad Bhabie]
Go best friend, that's my best friend
That's my main bitch, that's my fuckin' best friend (Best friend)
If you got a problem then we got a problem
If she got a problem then you got a problem (Bitch)
She gon' twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk that ass
Like it's her fuckin' birthday, bitch twerk that ass (Twerk that ass)
That's my best friend, that's my fucking bestie
Can't fuck with you hoes 'cause you messy
Pull up to the party, I got everybody lit
I could brag about my best friends, everybody rich (We rich)
Double dutching with the money, I be playin' with the bands
Birkin bag, Fashion Nova, Cartier on the lens
Every time we pull up, bitches pissed off (Pissed off)
Make the whole club jump like Kris Kross (Kris Kross)
I'm a bad bitch, poppin' like lip gloss (Lip gloss)
We be blowin' money fast like Rick Ross (Rick Ross)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Go bitch, go bitch, go bestie (Go bitch)
Can't fuck with these hoes 'cause they messy ('Cause they messy)
Go bitch, go bitch, go bestie (Go bitch)
Can't fuck with these hoes 'cause they messy
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend (Go, go, go, go, go, go)
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend (Go bitch)
Go bestie
That my what? That my muhfuckin' best friend (Go bitch)
