[Intro]
Go Grizz
Winner's Circle

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Sad lil' bitch, get ratchet (ratchet)
Jump on that bitch like mattress (mattress)
Two three ho's, I'm magic (magic)

[?] drip, hot fashion (hot fashion)
Drop top, AC blasting (blasting)
Two hundred on a dash, I'm gassing (gassing)
Iced out Cartier glasses (glasses)
Rolls-Royce poppin' out nasty (nasty)
Dog walk one of these bitches (bitches)
Dog walk one of these bitches (these ho's)
Dog walk one of these bitches (bitches)
Dog walk one of these bitches (these ho's)
Bad lil' bitch, get ratchet (ratchet)
Jump on that bitch like mattress (like mattress)
Two three ho's, I'm magic (magic)

[?] drip, hot fashion (hot fashion)

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
Got five hoes [?] the magic
And you know I make em all do magic
No license but I'm guessing
I'll catch your bitch, you trippin'
My brothers [?]
The realest bitch, you plastic
He switch a lot like [?]
Racks on me got a big guap
I fly shot like [?]
I just want it on my wrist won't [?]
Now I'm dripping down my neck like [?]
Hit the gas on the mothertrucker, clear up
Big seats big drums, who you rock out?
Tell em' how you talk shit but I do, which you really look up to em'
And when I really go down we know who gon' shoot
Stealing from hoes, why you in your brother clothes?
The real hood bitch, too much to let your [?] know
Cause when y'all gotta ride we know who don't got no smoke
Claiming you a gangsta heard and knock and hit the floor

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Bad lil' bitch, get ratchet (ratchet)
Jump on that bitch like mattress (mattress)
Two three ho's, I'm magic (magic)

[?] drip, hot fashion (hot fashion)
Drop top, AC blasting (blasting)
Two hundred on a dash, I'm gassing (gassing)
Iced out Cartier glasses (glasses)
Rolls-Royce poppin' out nasty (nasty)
Dog walk one of these bitches (bitches)
Dog walk one of these bitches (these ho's)
Dog walk one of these bitches (bitches)
Dog walk one of these bitches (these ho's)
Bad lil' bitch, get ratchet (ratchet)
Jump on that bitch like mattress (like mattress)
Two three ho's, I'm magic (magic)
