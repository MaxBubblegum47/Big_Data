Go bitch, go bitch, go bestie (Go bitch)
Can't fuck with these hoes ’cause they messy (Messy)
Go bitch, go bitch, go bestie (Go bitch)

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
Go best friend, that's my best friend
That's my main bitch, that's my fuckin' best friend (Best friend)
If you got a problem then we got a problem
If she got a problem then you got a problem (Bitch)

Like it’s her fuckin' birthday, bitch twerk that ass (Twerk that ass)
That’s my best friend, that's my fucking bestie
Can't fuck with you hoes 'cause you messy
Pull up to the party, I got everybody lit
I could brag about my best friends, everybody rich (We rich)
Double dutching with the money, I be playin’ with the bands
Birkin bag, Fashion Nova, Cartier on the lens (On the lens)
Every time we pull up, bitches pissed off (Pissed off)
Make the whole club jump like Kris Kross (Kris Kross)
I'm a bad bitch, poppin' like lip gloss (Lip gloss)
We be blowin' money fast like Rick Ross (Rick Ross)

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Ayy, ayy, look
Go bitch, go bitch, go bestie (Go bitch)
Run up, and get done up, so you bitches better not test me (Bow, bow bow)
Big ol' ass poppin', yeah I'm bad and she bad too
Clique full of haters, yeah you mad, your friend mad too (Ah)
I ain't fightin' with these hoes, I'm a rich bitch (Bitch)
Hair long, nails long, VVs on my neck bitch (Necklace)
If you wanna beef with me, I hope you got that fee for me
Foot up on they necks, make it hard for hoes to speak to me (Shh)
Your hoes better not fuck with my best friend
'Cause if she don't like you bitch, then I don't like you either (Yeah, ah)
I know some hoes talkin' shit but quiet when we see 'em (Shh)
They try to act like they ain't like me, now they wanna link up, ah

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Go bitch, go bitch, go bestie (Go bitch)
Can't fuck with these hoes 'cause they messy ('Cause they messy)
Go bitch, go bitch, go bestie (Go bitch)
Can't fuck with these hoes 'cause they messy
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend (Go, go, go, go, go, go)
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend
Go bestie, that my muhfuckin' best friend (Go bitch)
Go bestie
That my what? That my muhfuckin' best friend (Go bitch)
