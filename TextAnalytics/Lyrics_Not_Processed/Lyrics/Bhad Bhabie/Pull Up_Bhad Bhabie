[Chorus]
Buss and throw it back
Pop that ass and make it clap
Show my ass and show his fitness
Poppin' ass and shaking titties

[Verse 1]
Damn, we really made the bitch mad
Damn, we really made the bitch mad
Got the pink slip, big forty's when we pull up
Bitch she fucking with his better, tell the bitch "pull up"
New paid Patek, got him spending all his dollars
Know I can [?] that bitch a problem

[Chorus]
Buss and throw it back
Pop that ass and make it clap
Show my ass and show his fitness
Poppin' ass and shaking titties
Buss and throw it back
Pop that ass and make it clap
Show my ass and show his fitness
Poppin' ass and shaking titties

[Verse 2]
All my bitches independent, shaking titties
Poppin' ass and shaking titties
Show my ass and show his fitness
Poppin' ass and shaking titties
All my bitches independent, I hang with bitches now thеy did it
The type-a bitch you know she with it
Wе come through and shake the ceiling
Fuck his ex, told that bitch bye-bye
See that lil pussy got that bite-bite
Wet lil shit yeah that tight-tight
Knock his ass out call it night-night

[Chorus]
Buss and throw it back
Pop that ass and make it clap
Show my ass and show his fitness
Poppin' ass and shaking titties
Buss and throw it back
Pop that ass and make it clap
Show my ass and show his fitness
Poppin' ass and shaking titties
