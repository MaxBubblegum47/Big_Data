[Intro]
Oh my God, Ronny

[Chorus]
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
I do not sniff it or roll it (No)
It do not drip when I pour it (No)
I do not run, I reload it (No, no)
I do not save it, I throw it
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch

[Verse]
Please stop, please stop, please stop, please stop! (Stop that shit)
That fit look like you bought it at a kiosk  (Was it on sale though?)
And they got the nerve to ask, "Why she hot?" (She hot)
Why you countin' all that money that we got?
I ain't worried 'bout no basic bitches
All y'all look like you still fly Spirit
All y'all must not've looked in the mirror
All y'all lookin' but the windows tinted like... (Hi, bitch)
I don't know what made all y'all haters (Hi, bitch)
Play if you want, but you know I ain't playin' like...

[Chorus]
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
I do not sniff it or roll it (No)
It do not drip when I pour it (No)
I do not run, I reload it (No, no)
I do not save it, I throw it
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch
Hi, bitch – hi, bitch

[Outro]
Grown as hell and you still hatin'?
I look at you and thank God, I made it like...
Hi, bitch
Hi, bitch
