[Intro]
Pliznaya

[Chorus]
You know I ain't fucking with no thot opps (Nope)
I don't help these bitches, I don't throw lobs (Nope)
Cut these fucking hoes off like a chop block (Cut your ass)
I'ma be around when they clout drop
You know you ain't gang, you ain't gang, you ain't gang
Please stay in your lane, in your lane, in your lane
These dudes all the same, all the same, all the same
Please stay in your lane, in your lane, in your lane (Bitch)

[Verse]
Fall back, lil' bitch, who you fuckin' with? (Who you fuckin' with)
When we pull up, bet she get to ducking quick
He don't want you, lil' ho, you a hit and quit (hit and quit)
Can't be fucking with these bitches, they some counterfeit
I just blocked these hoes, now I don't need to don't need to stress 'em (Nope)
Don't waste no time on my phone if it ain't about some fucking bread
Ain't no competition with these hoes, lil' Bhabie been ahead
Rollie shining in these streets, Bhabie different from the rest
I ain't chasing, I ain't waiting, all I care about is Franklins
I ain't scary, I ain't sneaky, get your bitch, I see her geeking
I'm just grinding, I'm just climbing, don't wear my chain, but it got diamonds
I'm a hustler, I'm a savage, want these problems? Let's get active (Lil' hoe)

[Chorus]
You know I ain't fucking with no thot opps (Nope)
I don't help these bitches, I don't throw lobs (Never)
Cut these fucking hoes off like a chop block (Lil' bitch)
I'ma be around when they clout drop
You know you ain't gang, you ain't gang, you ain't gang
Please stay in your lane, in your lane, in your lane
These dudes all the same, all the same, all the same
Please stay in your lane, in your lane, in your lane (Bitch)
