[Chorus]
I ain't ask for this shit, but I got it (but I got it)
I ain’t ask for this shit, but I rock it (yeah, I rock it, bitch)
I go shhh on a bitch, be quiet (be quiet, ho)
I go shhh on a bitch, be quiet (be quiet, ho)
I ain't ask for it, I was made for it (I was made for it)
I ain't ask for it, bitch I was made for it (I was made for it)
I go shhh on a bitch, be quiet (be quiet, ho)
I go shhh on a bitch, be quiet (be quiet, ho)

[Verse]
My car a immigrant, with the windows tint
I can’t see you hoes, you be fakin' shit, got Kylie on ya lip
I go swoop, baby hairs, then I swoop, in my coupe
I could sneeze on a bitch, and that shit make the news
J-j-just the other day, Billboard count the plays
It's fuck Charlemagne, donkey of the day, he washed and he fake
Don't eat breakfast anyway, just wake up and get the cake
Put the cash down on the wraith, you put it on lay-a-way (you fake)
I went from noodles to lobster
Just paid off the crib for my mama
Ain't wastin' no time, so I clocked her
Clean up on that bitch, yeah I mopped her
Ridin' with yo bitch in a drop
Ain't no secret, she might be a cop
On my wrist is a rose coloured watch (watch)
Broke ho, you got it from Ross (ha-ha-ha)
I’m rich, don’t tell me the cost (nope)
Goyard over Lacoste (over Lacoste)
Don't need a job, Bhabie a boss
I’m drippin', I got all the sauce (I need it, bitch)
Yo slippin', you trippin' on me
My foot on yo neck, wait till you caught
I got all the chips
She stay throwin’ salt, but that ain't my fault

[Chorus]
I ain't ask for this shit, but I got it (but I got it)
I ain't ask for this shit, but I rock it (yeah, I rock it, bitch)
I go shhh on a bitch, be quiet (be quiet, ho)
I go shhh on a bitch, be quiet (be quiet, ho)
I ain't ask for it, I was made for it (I was made for it)
I ain't ask for it, bitch I was made for it (I was made for it)
I go shhh on a bitch, be quiet (be quiet, ho)
I go shhh on a bitch, be quiet (be quiet, ho)
