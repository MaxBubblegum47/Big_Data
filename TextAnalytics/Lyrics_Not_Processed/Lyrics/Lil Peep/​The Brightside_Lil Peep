[Verse]
I know that you want me, you know that I want you
The memories haunt me, I know that they haunt you too
But it's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, it's alright, you'll be fine
As long as you're mine, take a look at the time
It gets cold at night, when you're alone outside
But it's fine, I'll be fine
Pay me no mind, girl, pay me no mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Just look at the bright side (Just look at the bright side)
Just look at the club lights (Rollin' under the club lights)
I gotta look at the bright side (Look at the bright side)
I guess she wasn't the one, right, this isn't what love's like, that's for sure

[Chorus]
Help me find a way to pass the time (To pass the time)
Everybody tellin' me life's short, but I wanna die (I wanna die)
Help me find a way to make you mine (Make you mine)
Everybody tellin' me not to, but I'm gonna try
Now I'm gettin' high again, tonight

[Verse]
I know that you want me, you know that I want you
The memories haunt me, I know that they haunt you too
But it's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, it's alright, you'll be fine
As long as you're mine, take a look at the time
It gets cold at night, when you're alone outside
But it's fine, I'll be fine
Pay me no mind, girl, pay me no mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Just look at the bright side (Just look at the bright side)
Just look at the club lights (Rollin' under the club lights)
I gotta look at the bright side (Look at the bright side)
I guess she wasn't the one, right, this isn't what love's like, that's for sure

[Chorus]
Help me find a way to pass the time (To pass the time)
Everybody tellin' me life's short, but I wanna die (I wanna die)
Help me find a way to make you mine (Make you mine)
Everybody tellin' me not to, but I'm gonna try
Now I'm gettin' high again, tonight

[Outro]
Just look at the bright side (Just look at the bright side)
Just look at the club lights (Rollin' under the club lights)
Just look at the nightlife (Just look at the nightlife)
Watchin' the sunrise by my side
We gotta look at the bright side (Just look at the bright side)
Rollin' under the club lights (Rollin' under the club lights)
I gotta look at the bright side (Just look at the bright side)
I guess she wasn't the one, right
This isn't what love's like
That's for sure
