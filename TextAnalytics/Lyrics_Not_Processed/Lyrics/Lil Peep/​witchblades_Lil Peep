[Intro]
MoneyPosse
Ooh, Bi-Big Head on the beat

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Switchblades, cocaine
GothBoiClique make a ho shake
Black fur, black coat
GothBoiClique in the back, ho
Switchblades, cocaine
GothBoiClique 'til my soul take
Black jeans, half black hoes
GothBoiClique in the castle

[Verse 1: Lil Tracy]
In high school, I was a loner
I was a reject, I was a poser
Multiple personalities, I'm bipolar
I swear, I mean well, I'm still goin' to hell
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die, bury me with all my ice on

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
When I die, bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
When I die, bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

[Verse 3: Lil Tracy]
Clothes off, baby, I got good white
Tell me a secret and I'll tell one of mines
I just wanna talk, I don't wanna fight
Ask me if I'm alright, do you want me to lie?

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Switchblades, cocaine
GothBoiClique make a ho shake
Black fur, black coat
GothBoiClique in the back, ho
Switchblades, cocaine
GothBoiClique 'til my soul take
Black jeans, half black hoes
GothBoiClique in the castle
