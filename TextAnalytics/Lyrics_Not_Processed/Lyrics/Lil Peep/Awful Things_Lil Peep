[Intro: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
You like attention, I find it obvious
She makes it obvious for me
She feels the tension
It's just the two of us, it's just the two of us, tonight
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I get it, girl
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I'm not the one

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
Don't you turn your back on me
Let your teardrops fall on me
Speeding away, the city in the rear view
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
GothBoi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down 'til there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies and gems
You can have all of them

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me
