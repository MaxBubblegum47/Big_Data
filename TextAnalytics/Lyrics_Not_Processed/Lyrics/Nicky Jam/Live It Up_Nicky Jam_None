[Letra de "Live It Up" ft. Will Smith & Era Istrefi]

[Intro: Era Istrefi]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Nicky Jam]
One life, live it up, 'cause we got one life
One life, live it up, 'cause we got one life
One life, live it up, 'cause you don't get it twice
One life, live it up, 'cause you don't get it twice

[Verse 1: Era Istrefi]
Strength your numbers, is a force we can mix
We raise our flags and put our pride on our back
We feelin' like a champion when we shine our light
We got the power, make condition correct

[Chorus: Era Istrefi]
One life, live it up, 'cause you got one life
One-one-one life, live it up, 'cause you got one life
One-one-one life, live it up, 'cause you don't get it twice
One-one-one life, live it up, 'cause you don't get it twice

[Post-Chorus: Era Istrefi]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
One life, one dream
One moment, one team
One youth, lights high
Thousand roadblocks, one shot
One truth, no fears
One flag, oh yeah
We've been waiting for this all year
Where y'all at? We're right here

[Verse 3: Nicky Jam]
Ya empezó la rumba y estamos celebrando
Todo el mundo que me levante la mano
'Tamos vivos, hay que disfrutarlo
Hoy nadie me detiene porque yo no sé parar, no, no

[Chorus: Nicky Jam]
One life, live it up, 'cause we got one life
One life, live it up, 'cause we got one life
One life, live it up, 'cause you don't get it twice
One life, live it up, 'cause you don't get it twice

[Post-Chorus: Era Istrefi]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge: Will Smith]
For the love
I'm a rebel I'm coming from
Every nation under the sun
Elevating their favorite song when we hit and run
You own it, you got it
The whole world is watching
So let's get this pumping
Where y'all at? We're right here

[Chorus: Nicky Jam]
Only one life to live, got so much to give
Fighting for the nation now, that is my gift
Run like a champion and win like a king
That's my only goal, my everything
Living up now, now

[Post-Chorus: Era Istrefi & Nicky Jam]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (Living up now, now)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (Unity, ambition)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (Victory, celebration)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (One love, one nation)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (Ayy)

[Outro: Era Istrefi, Nicky Jam & Will Smith]
That's freedom when you reach that goal
That's freedom when you reach that goal
That's freedom when you reach that goal
That's freedom when you reach that goal
