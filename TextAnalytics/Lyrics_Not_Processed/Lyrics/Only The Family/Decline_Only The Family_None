[Hook: Chief Keef]
I'm rollin', she callin', she stalkin'
My phone and, I don't answer
I keep declining
She keep whinin' on my line and
I'm like go, I'm on the road
I'm fuckin' hoes, I'm countin' rolls
And you know, how it glo'
With the glo, we get dough

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
She rollin', gold diggin'
She call me, I'm on it
Talkin' shit, my bitch
She calling me, block list
Thot bitch, opp shit
She can't come home no more
I say she on the opp shit
Can't call my phone no more
Said the bitch wanna fuck with a no name
He a straight goofy, he so lame
Sippin' on the act, that's codeine
Sit back catch a nut, thatâ€™s protein
OTF bitch that's, Glo Gang
Got 20k stuffed in these Balmain's
Broke ass nigga keep talking
You ain't gang gang, gang gang, gang

[Hook: Chief Keef]

And you know, how it glo'

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Smokin' dope, ridin' slow
When I ride fast, cops on my ass
So I know, ride cautious
Cars be stalkin', cars be honkin'
Like my hoes, they be on my ass
They just want my cash, they just wanna brag
I can't loan they ass, I ain't on that man
I got lots of gwap, and you know that man
I send lot of shots, and you know that man
I been doing this shit since 08 man
Sellin' D, know that man
Ain't nothin' to me, I been doin' that man

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I got the gang with me
No opp shit but they can't hang with me
She got to pay for this dick bitch
You can't come hang for free
I ain't talkin' bout the app
No nigga in the city come hang with me
Niggas try to rob but I keep my chain with me
That shit dead, nigga who scared?
No Su-Wu, how we move, no purp, so we sip red
Shawty wanna ride with a real nigga
Shawty gone die for a real nigga
Shawty won't lie to a real nigga
But she rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
