[Intro]
Let's get it
Eh ohh
No oh

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She don't know about real niggas, she don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars, she don't what that cost
She don't know about love, she don't know what that is
She don't know about riding 'round and spending it like this (Now she wanna fuck)
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Hit the club with a nigga like me
Do drugs with a nigga like me
Fall in love with a nigga like me
And never love another nigga, never love another nigga like me
(Me, me)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Have you ever met a Chi-Town nigga?
Girl I heard you need a go-getter
You ain't never meet a rapper with the swag of a savage and a dope dealer
I'm the realest nigga that you see
I know you tired of them broke niggas
Heard he bought you a bag for a G
Why you fuckin' with them broke niggas?
Gingerale in a fifth of liquor
Where you going girl I'm going with ya
Ride with me 'cause I'm number one
Two bitches, Malcolm in the middle
Fly to Vegas, bet life
Legs in the air, call it jet life
Shawty give me top with the neck like
Shit gave me life, I can't get right, I can't get right

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Got you jacuzzi water on a hundred
Got your tempo on a hundred, let it bubble up (Bubble up, bubble up, bub)
Need a bad bitch, tryna be a bad girl
You know I'm tryna trouble up (I'm tryna trouble up, trouble)
Buy everything she wants two times, baby double up (Know you really want it)
Say she need more niggas out here like me 'cause there's not enough

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She don't know about real niggas, she don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars, she don't what that cost
She don't know about love, she don't know what that is
She don't know about riding 'round and spending it like this (Now she wanna fuck)
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Hit the club with a nigga like me
Do drugs with a nigga like me
Fall in love with a nigga like me
And never love another nigga, never love another nigga like me
(Me, me)

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
You ain't never been in my town nigga
A good place to go but the murder rate's so ridiculous
Fell in love with some R&B bitch
And I know that it's good for the fame and for the image
Shawty gave me head like a penny
But she should go gold
Ain't really been in love in a minute
It won't hurt if no one know about me
Fuck a bag off
No make up you look better with your mask off
Rich nigga wanna buzz, like to brag y'all
But a nigga like me, ain't no nigga like me
I'm a Boss, Hugo
Rich nigga since birth, you know
You my bitch don't get mad, Cujo
Nigga like me
I'm that nigga, nigga
Gettin' money since a little nigga
Shawty thinks she the shit, but she could be a little thicker
Fuck on my name and a little liquor
I got em pissed, I'm the shit nigga
So why do they hate? I gotta get cake
These niggas so fake, so stay out my way
Ain't too many niggas like me

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She don't know about real niggas, she don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars, she don't what that cost
She don't know about love, she don't know what that is
She don't know about riding 'round and spending it like this (Now she wanna fuck)
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Hit the club with a nigga like me
Do drugs with a nigga like me
Fall in love with a nigga like me
And never love another nigga, never love another nigga like me
(Me, me)
