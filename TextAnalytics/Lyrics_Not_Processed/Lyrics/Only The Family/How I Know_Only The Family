[Chorus: Lil Durk & 
Lil Baby
]
How I know if you die for me?
Know if you shoot for me?
How I know if you still love me? yeah, yeah
How I know you won't steal from me?
Know you won't kill for me?
I know that you still love me, yeah, yeah
How I know you won't turn on me?
Feel like the love phony, gotta keep my gun on me, yeah, yeah
How I know you won't die for me?
Know you will ride for me, just don't ever lie to me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Thought I'd never see the day that you would switch up
Ain't no hard feelings, I'm wishing you good luck
I can't lie, I miss your touch, you got that good love
I put diamonds on your hand, don't hold your fist up
How I know if I get jammed you gon' keep it real?
How you gon' say that I ain't solid, I ain't ever squealed
If I die today give it to my son, ain't writin' no will
All these thoughts inside my head, it got me poppin' pills
Runnin' with my steel, there's some niggas in the rear
If they get they chance they will
But I ain't worried, I'm gon' kill
I'm gon' drill every one of them
We gon' kill every one of them

[Chorus: Lil Durk & 
Lil Baby
]
How I know if you die for me?
Know if you shoot for me?
How I know if you still love me? yeah, yeah
How I know you won't steal from me?
Know you won't kill for me?
I know that you still love me, yeah, yeah
How I know you won't turn on me?
Feel like the love phony, gotta keep my gun on me, yeah, yeah
How I know you won't die for me?
Know you will ride for me, just don't ever lie to me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
One time to cross out Migo, he gon' take your life
So I don't understand how Plies ran off on the plug twice
And you can't remix none of that lean if it's not cut right
And you can't say you super trill 'cause you ain't cut right
Sex her once then kick her out 'cause I don't nut twice
The way that A$AP died don't sit in my gut right
And if we ever find the killer then he must die
And I'm always low on niggas, I don't trust high
I don't know if you'll ride, I don't know if you gon' slide
I don't know want me to die, I don't know if it's your pride
And if it is then hide it then
Me and Lil Baby do it for the trenches, we gon' ride with them

[Chorus: Lil Durk & 
Lil Baby
]
How I know if you die for me?
Know if you shoot for me?
How I know if you still love me? yeah, yeah
How I know you won't steal from me?
Know you won't kill from me?
I know that you still love me, yeah, yeah
How I know you won't turn on me?
Feel like the love phony, gotta keep my gun on me, yeah, yeah
How I know you won't die for me?
Know you will ride for me, just don't ever lie to me, yeah, yeah
