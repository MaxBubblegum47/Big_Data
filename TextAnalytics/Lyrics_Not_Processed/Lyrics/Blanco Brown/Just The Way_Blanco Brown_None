[Intro: Parmaelee]
I love you just the way God made you
Girl, he don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful babe
Tell em Blanc

[Verse 1: Blanco Brown]
The way your hair’s in a mess in the morning when you open your eyes
The way an hour goes by when you say that you'll be ready in five
(Yeah, Uh)
The little dimple on the side of your smile  when you're laughing at a movie that you’ve seen about a thousand times
You know girl that I can't lie

[Chorus: Blanco Brown & Parmalee]
I love you just the way God made you
Girl, He don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful babe
So let my eyes be your mirror
And you're bound to see it too
‘Cause I was made for lovin'
Just the way God made you
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)

[Verse 2: Parmalee & 
Blanco Brown
]
Yeah, the flush in your cheeks when you're mad but you say that you're not (
Yeah
)
And the shape of the face that you make when you're taking a shot (
Taking a shot
)
The little white lie that you told the security guard
At the hotel pool when we got caught
Yeah, I was thinking girl you never looked so hot
(
You never looked so hot
)

[Chorus: Blanco Brown & Parmalee]
I love you just the way God made you
Girl He don’t make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful babe
So let my eyes be your mirror
And you’re bound to see it too
‘Cause I was made for lovin'
Just the way God made you
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
God made you
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)

[Bridge: Blanco Brown & 
Parmalee
]
Girl I ain’t ever gonna try to change ya (Come on)
My masterpiece, my Mona Lisa and I need ya
To stay just the way God made ya
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
Just the way God made ya
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)

[Chorus: Blanco Brown & Parmalee]
I love you just the way God made you
Girl He don't make mistakes
What you call your imperfections
I call beautiful babe
So let my eyes be your mirror
And you're bound to see it too
‘Cause I was made for lovin'
Just the way God made you
God made You
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
God made You
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
God made You
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
God made You
(Just the way, just the way, just the way, just the way God made you)
