Knows how to party
Knows how to party, in the 
city
We keep it rocking

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Whatever I say, woo, to make you take your love away from me (don't do it, baby)
I take it back (yeah)
And whatever I did, just tell me how to fix it and I'll do that (okay)
'Cause I need you back (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ever since you've been gone, I've been running through
All these girls, they don't compare to you (compare to you)
The way you throw that shit back (back)
Thing so fat but they don’t do it like you (fat)
And girl, I know it's wrong but I'm still stuck on you (woo, ooh)
The way you used to look in your jeans before I took 'em off

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko, R. Kelly]
Juicy, said I wanna get to know your juicy booty, tonight
So show me that, show me that, so show me that, so show me that
Girl I'm tryna make you juicy, yeah yeah, juicy booty, girl, tonight
So turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
Ooh, you got this pussy so juicy
Got me ready to do anything and everything that you say
Yeah, and it is a honor 'cause you got a huge thing, haha
And if you could get it in and put it in, touché, I ain't never scared, oh wee
I like the way that you keep it up all night
You make me feel it in places
That I've never felt this way inside
That dick the greatest of all time
You are the greatest of all time, I love to give you a hard time
Tell me again that it’s all mine
So juicy, ayy,

Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko & R. Kelly]

Girl, I'm tryna make you juicy, yeah yeah, juicy, juicy booty, girl, tonight
So turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
All of these 
fellas
 say
Most of these cats, can't talk that money like I do (money, do)
And most of these cats, when it comes to these bitches ain't got a clue (bitches, clue)
Most of the time, you can find me laid up with a couple models (laid up, couple models)
Most of the time, you can find me in the club popping these bottles (bottles)
Who cares about tonight when I own the future?
So baby girl, ride out with me into the future (future)
I make that booty my point of view, come and see life from my point of view (point of view, my point of view)
I am a freak, I hope that you are too (you are too)
Gripping her hands, what you want to? Hey
Smoking and sipping on everything
We gon' get high 'til we touch the moon (ooh, touch the moon)
So turn around and introduce me to that

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko & R. Kelly]
Juicy, said I wanna get to know your juicy booty, tonight
So show me that, so show me that, so show me that
Girl, I'm tryna make you juicy, yeah yeah, juicy, juicy booty, girl, tonight
So turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around

[Bridge: R. Kelly & Chris Brown]
All of the fellas say, "Oh, girl"
Yeah, baby, I can't get you off my mind 'cause that ass so fat, when you do it like that
And you make me say, "Oh girl"
When you're in front and I'm behind, can I get you back? (Ooh)
And when you come (when you come)
Don't forget that ass, ass
