[Verse 1: Nyusha, Arash, & Nyusha & Arash]
Wicked, lick it, started it with a wicked
Pick up the vodka, I don't think you're ready
La la la, let's go, La la la, let's go
Pop it, let me hit it with my booty

I'll make you crazy
You're about to lose it
Mama mia, let's go
Take that thing to the floor

[Bridge: Blanco]
Lil mama let me see you work it
(Work it!)
Baby girl, yeah twerk it
(Oooh, yeah!)

Take the thing down south
(Yeah, damn!)
Wow, wow, wow, wow

[Pre-Hook: Arash]
Come feel the rendezvous
Run up and down your avenue
Destination, me and you
Let's go, somewhere we can make a move

Together we will never lose
Champions, we're breaking rules
Oh ya, oh ya, oh ya, oh ya

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Your boy's a fighter, your boy's a grinder
She winding, and I'm behind her
I gotta em lined up, for the victory
No if, ands, or buts about it, this is history

Mr. Worldwide, is more famous than Vegas
Talkin all colors, all cultures, all countries, all ages
Russia to the world baby
Now you know where the game is

I was born to take over the world, I'm shameless
Mr. Worldwide, talking to the world again
Mr. Worldwide (wow, wow, wow, wow)

[Pre-Hook: Arash]
Come feel the rendezvous
Run up and down your avenue

Let's go, somewhere we can make a move

Together we will never lose
