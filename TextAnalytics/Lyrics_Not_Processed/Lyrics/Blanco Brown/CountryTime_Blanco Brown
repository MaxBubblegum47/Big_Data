[Intro]
Whoa

[Chorus]
I hear the voices in my head
My middle finger's 'bout to pledge
Oh, can't you see that blue and red?
Some things are better left unsaid, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I put two gunshots in the air
The people scattered everywhere
But I don't really give a care, nope
Some things in life are just unfair
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I walk upright like a soldier
Yeah, I'm hot like Arizona
Mix the bacon and the soda
I ain't mixin' bakin' soda
Mm, yay, yay, yay, yay
Ain't scared of no rain
I walk upright like a soldier
Yeah, I'm cold as North Dakota
Mix the bacon and the soda
I ain't mixin' bakin' soda
Mm, yay, mm, yay
Ain't scared of no pain

[Chorus]
I hear the voices in my head
My middle finger's 'bout to pledge
Oh, can't you see that blue and red?
Some things are better left unsaid, yeah

[Verse 2]
If you're on one, on one
You just gotta hold on, hold on
We all need someone to lean on, yeah
But you gotta be strong, yeah
If you're on one, on one
You just needa hold on, hold on
We all need someone to lean on, yeah
But we gotta be strong, yeah

[Chorus]
I put the gun up to my head (Head)
But I was already dead (Dead)
Sometimes you have to kill the flesh (Flesh)
To get some things up off your chest (Chest)
I heard the voices in my head
I'm screamin' fuck the blue and red
Now it's startin' to all make sense
Some things are better left unsaid

[Verse 3]
Son of a gun stealin' all the fun
In a barn full of corn where the steel mill turn
Limousine full of smoke with the windows down
Every day's a new day, get your moonshine on
Hillbilly's got to rockin' and the rockin' turned to dancin'
At a bonfire full of all paraphernalia, yuh, huh
Damn right, uh-huh
Son of a gun stealin' all the fun
In a barn full of corn where the steel mill turn
Limousine full of smoke with the windows down
Every day's a new day, get your moonshine on
Hillbilly's got to rockin' and the rockin' turned to dancin'
At a bonfire full of all paraphernalia, yuh, huh
Damn right

[Outro]
I put two gunshots in the air
