[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
