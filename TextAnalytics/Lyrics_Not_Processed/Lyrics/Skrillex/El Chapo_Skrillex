[Intro: The Game]
Skrillex
Bangladesh
I am the God (God, God, God)
(God, God, God, God)

[Chorus: The Game]
El Chapo (whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
I am the God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)
El Chapo (whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
I am the God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)
El Chapo (whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
I am the God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)

[Verse 1: The Game]
You know I get the kilos
Cincuenta porciento
If you are not bilingual
Get the fuck up out of town, 'fore we run your ass down
Underground how I came out, any nigga try to stop me
Let it hang out, let it bang, let it rain out
Yo soy el dios
You adios, nigga (I am the God)
Seen a nigga chopped up on a Tuesday
While the club goin' up on a Tuesday
This is doomsday, I can have Guadalupe
Come through and knock Donald Trump out his toupee
Now look at his brains all on the sidewalk
And tuck the .38 and jump on my skywalker
And whew, I'm rollin'
Shotgun, Claudia Ochoa (I am the God)
Only nigga walking through Sinaloa with the blood
Red Chuck Taylors on and you know it when I show up
It's a squad full of killers, squad full of hittas, squad full of
Niggas that'll pull up, let it bark on a nigga
Hundred six shots bark on a nigga, street sweeper wet
The whole block up, Noah's Ark on a nigga
Got two Glock 9s, two .45s, two Desert
Eagles and they fly together side by side
No juego conmigo, tu sabes de mio
No Tony Montana, mis amigos, mis kilos
Mi casa, su casa, cuidado con el chico
Tu quieres la blanca, yo tengo el perico
(Ya te dije el juego y fuego)

[Chorus: The Game]
El Chapo (whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
I am the God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)
El Chapo (whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
I am the God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)
El Chapo (whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Nigga, I am the God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)

[Interlude 1: The Game]
Pinche policías (Puto)
Jodiendo todo el día (Cabrón)
Que si jode tu familia (Mátalo)
On mi madre y mi tía (Así)

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm on a private jet with El Chapo, feet up
Sippin' Tecate bout to land for the re-up
Fuck the Montanas, we ain't got them trackin'
Devices, the feds they be watchin' and see us
Niggas wanna see us? Check the IG
I'm in the villa throwin' blood up like a IV
Don't try me, DeJ Loaf with the AK, 600
Million, 400 million from Dre Day, uh
Pablo Escobar in my hey-day, uh
Billion off coke that's a payday, uh
On a private jet that's a mayday, uh
In South America on a vacay, uh
P on my snapback, choppin' grade-a, uh
None of these niggas ready for the melee, uh
Hundred cal make his body do the Nae Nae, leave a nigga
Face worse off than Sheneneh, yo
I am the God, I've been tellin' you niggas
I got a bird and a chopper in the
Trunk, ven aqui, I will sell it to niggas
We can screw it and chop it
Machetes on deck, I will sever you niggas
Behind these bars I'm El Chapo
Motorcycle out the cell on you niggas

[Interlude 2: Candy Fuego]
Escúchame: ¡chinga tu madre!
Nunca me encontrarás
So para de mirar
No me controlas, te controlo
Controlo a todos
Me respetan o se mueren
Soy El Chapo y la hago en Sinaloa

[Chorus: The Game]
El Chapo (whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
I am the God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)
El Chapo (whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
I am the God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)
El Chapo (whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo)
Nigga, I am the God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)

[Outro: The Game]
Nigga, I am the God
