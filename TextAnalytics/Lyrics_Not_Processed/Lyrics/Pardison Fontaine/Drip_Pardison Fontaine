Won MVP, and I'm still a rookie, like woo
I gotta work on my anger (Ayy)
Might kill a bitch with my fingers (Ayy)
I gotta stay outta Gucci (Woo)
I'm finna run outta hangers (Woo)
Is she a stripper, a rapper or a singer?
I'm busting bucks in a Bentley Bentayga
Ride through your hood like "Bitch, I'm the mayor!"
You not my bitch, then bitch you in danger
