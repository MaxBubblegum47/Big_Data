[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 2: Logic]
I been at it with my homies, it don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my, squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Outro: Sam Harris]
More pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin'...
