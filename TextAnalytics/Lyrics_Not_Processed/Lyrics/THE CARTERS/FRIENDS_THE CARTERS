[Chorus 1: Beyoncé]
My friends, real friends, better than your friends
That's how we keep poppin' out that Benz, yeah
No foes, real friends, we ain't even got to pretend, yeah
Get bands, get bands, spend it all on my friends

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Gon' pull me up, pull me up, pull me up (pull me up, pull me up, pull me up)
And never let me down (They never let me down)
Gon' pull me up, pull me up, pull me up (pull me up, pull me up, pull me up)
And never let me drown (never let me drown)
Gon' pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
And never let me drown (never let me drown)
Gon' pull me up, pull me up, pull me up (pull me up, pull me up, pull me up)
I'll never hit the ground (never let me drown, never let me drown)

[Chorus 1: Beyoncé]
My friends, real friends, better than your friends, yeah
That’s how we keep popping out that Benz, yeah
Faux friends, real friends, better than your friends, yeah
Ask them, ask them, they know all my business

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I don't know what I would do without all of my crew, yeah
I ain't makin' no room, yeah, I ain't makin' no new friends
I don't make no moves, yeah, without tellin' my crew, yeah
That just how we do, yeah, that just how we do, oh
Goddammit it, I love my life, Styrofoam cups, no ice
Party 'fore we go inside
Never let them out my sight (ooh), they're right by my side (woo)
Them my ride-or-dies (ride), them my ride-or-dies (ride)
My friends are goals, your friends are foes (foes)
We fly, why cry? Our souls exposed, yeah
We smoke, we laugh, your stress, my stress
Closer than kin, I'm blessed, you blessed (blessed)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Ten toes, ten toes, we was out in that road, uh
Lookin' for love in wrong places, we proposed to a stove, yeah
Share jewels, share clothes, that's how deep this shit goes, yeah
Every week, ya got bros, all of y'all fear closure
Y'all switchin' sides like NBA teams just after halftime
I'm pullin' up on my dog, make sure he okay, I don't even have time
Then copped me a Porsche with butterscotch seats, this 'fore they had mils
Live better than rappers and they don't even have bills, it's that real
Bought Emory a BM as soon as he came home
We hopped on a plane, headed straight to the Bay
That's how we turn the game on, it's game on
Ty mama died, I was there,
 
my nephew died, he was there
He in my house more than I be there, more than Bey there
Ty Ty there,
 
E there,
 
Breezy there,
 
Juan there
High here,
 
Chaka there,
 
Law there,
 
they all here, ah yeah
Dez there,
 
Kawanna here,
 
shit feel like Nirvana here
Crib like the Soho House, I might stay in and grow out my hair
Tight circle, no squares, I'm geometrically opposed to you
Y'all like to try angles, y'all like to troll, do you?
Y'all talk around hoes, do you? Y'all don't follow codes, do you?
We know everything you say from niggas close to you, you emotional
When I say, "Free the dogs," I free 'em, that's how Meek got his freedom
Y'all put niggas on a t-shirt, it hurts you ain't never meet 'em
You got niggas in the feds, you ain't even tryna feed 'em
I'm tryna free the world, that's how deep I'm in
I ain't goin' to nobody nothin' if me and my wife beefin'
I don't care if the house on fire, I'm dyin', nigga, I ain't leavin'
Ty-Ty take care of my kids, after he done grievin'
If y'all don't understand that, we ain't meant to be friends

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Gon' pull me up, pull me up, pull me up (pull me up, pull me up, pull me up)
And never let me down (They never let me down)
Gon' pull me up, pull me up, pull me up (pull me up, pull me up, pull me up)
And never let me drown (never let me drown)
Gon' pull me up, pull me up, pull me up (pull me up, pull me up, pull me up)
And never let me drown (never let me drown)
Gon' pull me up, pull me up, pull me up (pull me up, pull me up, pull me up)
I'll never hit the ground (never let me drown, never let me drown)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
They pray, pray for me, they pray, pray for me
See better things for me, want better days for me, unexceptionally
They pray, pray for me, they pray, pray for me
Whenever I'm in need, they in the backseat, with the aux bumpin B
Uh ain't no pride involved, ain't no pride involved
In my heart, heart, heart, you know 4-4-4
That's my dog, dog, dogs, see your dogs, dogs, dogs
Point 'em out, out, out, point 'em out, out, out
What would I be without my friends? (What would I be without my friends?)
I ain't got no understanding (I ain't got no understanding)
'Bout them, you might just catch these hands
We fall out and we make amends, yeah, yeah
My friends

[Chorus 2: Beyoncé]
Your friends are foes, my friends are goals
Closer than kin, our souls exposed, yeah
Your friends are frauds, all they want is applause, yeah
And my friends, real friends, closer than kin

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them never let me drown
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them never let me down
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them never let me down
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
