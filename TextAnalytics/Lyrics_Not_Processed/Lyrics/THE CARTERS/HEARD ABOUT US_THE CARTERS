[Chorus: Beyoncé]
No need to ask, you heard about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
Already know you know about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
Watch your mouth when you're around us

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Pull up, hop out, wreck
Got no time, but we got Pateks
I come around, stepping on necks
My nigga got niggas upset, why?
Oh, why these bitches so mad for?
They don't want Yoncé on their door
Louis Slugger to your four door
Careful, you get what you asked for
We go, go-oh
Go to Cuba then Aruba in the middle of the winter (skrt, skrt)
Brand new Sprinter, we laugh to the bank
But we ain't no joke, yeah
You better act like you know, yeah

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
No need to ask, you heard about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
Already know you know about us
Ain't no need to ask, you heard about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
Watch your mouth when you're around us (Watch your back!)

[Post Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
If you don't know, now you know, nigga
He smoke and we drink, D’USSÉ to the face (yeah)
If you don't know, now you know, nigga
Put hoes in their place, bitch, stay in your lane
(Bitch, stay in your lane)
Talk that talk, B

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Billie Jean in his prime
For the thousandth time, the kid ain't mine
Online they call me "dad," kiddingly
You're not supposed to take this dad thing literally
That's too famous, we don't even really do famous
I'm cool on that, chuck the two fingers
Everyday I'm gettin' sued famous
I show up to court without a suit famous
Your every move is on the news, ain't it?
Shit has its perks too, ain't it?
Shootin' videos in the Louvre, ain't it?
It could be far worse for you, can't it?
Pain comes with penthouse views, ain't it?
Bitch know me, I been me since the cocaine
Bitch know B, she don't even need a whole name

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
No need to ask, you heard about us
(It's Beyoncé, nigga)
No need to ask, you heard about us
(Oh, my God)
Already know you know about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
Watch your mouth when you're around us

[Post Chorus: Beyoncé]
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
He smoke and we drink, D’USSÉ to the face
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Put hoes in their place, bitch stay in your lane

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Yeah, we the ones that y'all heard about
Make big noise, big noise, we don't need no voucher
Yeah, we the one's y'all worried about
We good, we good, keep us out your mouth
If you don't know, now you know, nigga
If you don't know, now you know, nigga
