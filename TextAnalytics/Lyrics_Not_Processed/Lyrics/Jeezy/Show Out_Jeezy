[Intro: Juicy J & 
Young Jeezy
]
Turn up
Mike WiLL Made-It
Yeahh
You know we always get money man
Young Jeezy, Big Sean, Juicy J
Ear Drummers
Boss shit, nigga, let's get it

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out
Every time they go out, you know they bring they hoe out
Every time I go out, you know I bring that blow out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Trippy niggas and a few hoes
One night, two shows
That's two mansions and a team expansion
Thumbin' through a check, got me sweatin' and pantin'
When you getting money chicks come around
Niggas start hatin' who's holdin' you down
All this ice I'm just livin' the life
Bad bitches want me, give me head like lice
Hit club LIV in a rush
Pockets so swole I think they finna bust
Ace in my hand and a 45 tuck
Money coming down codeine pourin' up
Smokin on some dope, always on a float
20 years in niggas callin me the G.O.A.T
Money adding up you haters going broke
Still in the game while you niggas ridin' oak
See me showin' out they muggin' I don't give a fuck
How I start my morning off a zip and a double cup
Hating ass niggas, y'all behind me
Ball so hard they want to fine me
Juicy J, Taylor Gang
I been rich since the 90's

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out
Every time they go out, you know they bring they hoe out
Every time I go out, you know I bring that blow out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
All these ratchet hoes say I ain't shit
Well, at least I ain't broke ho
Stackin paper like old folks
And you still stayin' with your old folks
She a fan, that's fantastic
, poppin' xannies, that's xantastic
Gettin rich, band-tastic
, white girls like Anne Hathaway
Way going, way out, they wait for my bandwagon
She let me bang and I ain't got a bandana
Ooh (Freaky) that's just how I move
Fast girls, fast money, no more fast food
Came up first class, my passport gettin' tattooed (boi)
Young ass playa doing everything that I have to
So every time I go out...

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out
Every time they go out, you know they bring they hoe out
Every time I go out, you know I bring that blow out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I got some bad bitches with me
Say they like Rihanna love Whitney
She say how many bottles do you want, I told her 50
She say anything, yeah bitch a kidney
Every time I go out, you know I bring that dough out
Finesse is on a milli', it lookin' like a blowout
100 bitches with me, look like I left the ho house
100 racks with me, look like I left the blow house
Now we poppin' bottles, they came with the sparkles
Got my niggas with me, they came with them yoppers
Got a few ratchets, even a couple models
20 car caravan, I bet they gon follow, ugh

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out
Every time they go out, you know they bring they hoe out
Every time I go out, you know I bring that blow out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
