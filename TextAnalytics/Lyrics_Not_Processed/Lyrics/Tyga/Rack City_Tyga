[Verse 1]
Rack city, bitch, rack rack city, bitch
Ten, ten, ten, twenty on yo titties, bitch

T-Raw, you don't know who you fuckin with
Got my other bitch fuckin' with my other bitch
Fuckin' all night, nigga we ain't celibate
Niggas say I'm too dope, I ain't sellin' it
Raw fresher than a motherfuckin' peppermint

[Verse 2]
I'm a muthafuckin' star (star)
Look at the paint on the car (car)
Too much rim make the ride too hard
Tell that bitch hop out, walk the boulevard
I need my money pronto
Get it in the morning like Alonzo
Rondo, green got cheese like a nacho
If you don't got no ass, bitch, wear a poncho
Head honcho got my seat back
Nigga staring at me, don't get bapped
Got my shirt off, the club too packed
It's too turnt going up like gas
Goddamn, pulled out my rags
Mike, Mike Jackson, nigga yeah I'm Bad
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tatted up on my back
All the hoes love me, you know what it is
