[Intro]
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe

[Verse 1]
Northern lights in our skies
Plants that grow and open your mind
Things that swim with a neon glow
How we all got here, nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
These are real things
These are real things

[Chorus]
Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

[Verse 2]
Did I know you once in another life?
Are we here just once or a billion times?
Well, I wish I knew, but it doesn't matter
'Cause you're here right now, and I know what I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
And these are real things
Yeah, these are real things

[Chorus]
Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
Oh, and then there is you

[Pre-Chorus]
These are real things
These are real things

[Chorus 2]
Oh, what a world, all kinds of magic
Tell me it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you

[Outro]
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
(And then there is you)
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
