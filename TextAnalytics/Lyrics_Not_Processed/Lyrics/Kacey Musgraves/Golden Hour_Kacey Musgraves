[Verse 1]
All that I know
Is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time
With you

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
I used to get sad
And lonely when the sun went down
But it's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found
In you

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you know?
That you're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright

[Bridge]
You make the world look beautiful, ooh
I thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes
It looks like paradise

[Chorus]
You've set my world on fire, yeah
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
You're my golden hour
The color of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Golden hour
