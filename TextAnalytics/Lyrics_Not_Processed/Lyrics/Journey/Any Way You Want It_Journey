[Intro]
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

[Verse 1]
She loves to laugh
She loves to sing
She does everything
She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves the loving things

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, all night
All night
Oh, every night
So hold tight
Hold tight
Ooh, baby, hold tight
Oh, she said

[Chorus]
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

[Verse 2]
I was alone
I never knew
What good love could do
Ooh, then we touched
Then we sang
About the loving things

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, all night
All night
Oh, every night
So hold tight
Hold tight
Ooh baby, hold tight
Oh, she said

[Chorus]
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
I said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
She said ohh
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

[Chorus]
Oh, she said any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
(Any way) Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

[Chorus]
Oh, she said any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

[Chorus]
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

[Chorus]
(Any way) Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
(Any way) Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

[Chorus]
(Any way) Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
(Any way) Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
