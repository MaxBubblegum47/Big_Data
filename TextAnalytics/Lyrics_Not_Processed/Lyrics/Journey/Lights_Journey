[Chorus]
When the lights go down in the City
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I wanna be there in my City, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse]
So you think you're lonely
Well, my friend, I'm lonely too
I want to get back to my City by the bay
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
It's sad, oh, there's been mornings out on the road without you
Without your charms
Ooh, my, my, my, my, my, my
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
When the lights go down in the City
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I wanna be there in my City, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
When the lights go down in the City
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I wanna be there in my City, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Mmm
Oh, oh, oh
