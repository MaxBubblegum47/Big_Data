[Verse 1]
Winter is here again, oh lord
Haven't been home in a year or more
I hope she holds on a little longer
Sent a letter on a long summer day
Made of silver, not of clay
Ooh, I've been running down this dusty road

[Chorus]
Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turning
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turning

[Verse 2]
I've been trying to make it home
Got to make it before too long
Ooh, I can't take this very much longer, no
I'm standing in the sleet and rain
Don't think I'm ever gonna make it home again
The morning sun is rising
It's kissing the day

[Chorus]
Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turning
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turning
Whoa, whoa, whoa
My, my, my, my, my
For Tomorrow

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Oh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turning
Ooh, I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps me yearning
Ooh, I don't know, I don't know, whoa

[Chorus]
Oh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turning
Ooh, I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turning
Ooh, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, whoa

[Outro]
Wheel in the sky keeps on turning
Don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps turning
Wheel in the sky keeps on turning
