[Verse 1]
Lying beside you
Here in the dark
Feeling your heartbeat with mine
Softly you whisper
You're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?

[Pre-Chorus]
We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are
By my side

[Chorus]
So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms

[Verse 2]
Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

[Pre-Chorus]
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

[Chorus]
So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms
