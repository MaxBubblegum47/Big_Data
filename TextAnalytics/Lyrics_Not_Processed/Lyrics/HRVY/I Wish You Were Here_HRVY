[Intro]
I wish you were here
Every time you disappear
I'm missing your body let me make it clear
Every time you disappear
I, I want you near, I

[Verse 1]
I tried to stay cool about it
Cause you always seem cool without it
Why do I try?
I, I guess I want you to want me
When I say that I’m cool about it
I’m really not cool about it
Why don’t you come on by
Cos I, I really want you to want me

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you’re all I think about
Don’t make me say it out loud
Cause all I think about is you

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
(Oh, I wish you were here)
Every time you disappear
(Every time you disappear)
I'm missing your body let me make it clear
(Oh let me make it clear)
Every time you disappear
I, I want you near
I wish you were here
(Oh I wish you were here)

[Verse 2]
Taking my t-shirt off
Making this whole world stop
Up on the table top
Making this kitchen rock
I try to stay cool about it
Cause you always seem cool without it
Why do I try?
I, I guess I want you to want me

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you're all I think about
Don't make me say it out loud
Cause all I think about is you

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
(Oh, I wish you were here)
Every time you disappear
(Every time you disappear)
I'm missing your body
Let me make it clear (oh, yeah)
(Oh, let me make it clear)
Every time you disappear
I I want you near
I wish you were here

[Outtro]
Is it burning up your ears
Oh I wish you were here
Every time you disappear
I’m talking about you let me make it clear
Oh let me make it clear
Every time you disappear
I I want you near I
