[Verse 1]
You took this open heart of mine
Fixed me up and made it right
Lost and cold, but you love me still
Every space I couldn't feel

[Pre-Chorus]
You gimme all I ever needed
Half a heart and you complete it
Part of me I never knew, oh
I'm only me because of you

[Chorus]
I'm only me because of you
You know me better than I do
I'm saying how I feel, I'm just being real, yeah
Baby, that's the truth
I'm only me because of you, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'm only me because of you

[Verse 2]
You show me how to love my flaws, oh, no
And the person I'd not met before

[Pre-Chorus]
You gimme all I ever needed
Half a heart and you complete it
Part of me I never knew, oh
I'm only me because of you

[Chorus]
I'm only me because of you
You know me better than I do
I'm saying how I feel, I'm just being real, yeah
Baby, that's the truth
I'm only me because of you

[Bridge]
I'm only me because of you
I'm only me because of you

[Chorus]
I'm only me because of you
You know me better than I do
I'm saying how I feel, I'm just being real, yeah
Baby, that's the truth
I'm only me because of you, no, oh
You know me better than I do (I do, I do, I do, oh)
Saying how I feel, I'm just being real, yeah
Baby, that's the truth
I'm only me because of you
No, oh, I'm only me because of you
I'm saying how I feel, I'm just being real, yeah
Baby, that's the truth
I'm only me because of you
Oh, no, I'm only me because of you
