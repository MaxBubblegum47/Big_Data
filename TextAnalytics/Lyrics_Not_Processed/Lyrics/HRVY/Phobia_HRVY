I just don't know where to start
Time moves slow now we're apart
When we first met I was strong
I tell you my story
In this it was me and you
Thought that we were winners oh
Where story heart winners go
Can't get between us
But I've been sleeping with the light on
Like I'm afraid of the dark
Afraid of a broken heart
I don't wanna break your heart
No no no
I've got a phobia of being without ya
I've got a phobia of being alone
It's only a matter of time girl
Before I break down
Because I can't start being without ya
I've got a phobia of letting you go
And I want you to know
I'm not afraid no
I'm safe with you
We've been holding on so long
Time will make or break us so
Go with you I can't let go
You know it's about us
But I've been sleeping with the light on
Like I'm afraid of the dark
Afraid of a broken heart
I don't wanna break your heart
No no no
I've got a phobia of being without ya
I've got a phobia of being alone
It's only a matter of time girl
Before I break down
Because I can't start being without ya
I've got a phobia of letting you go
And I want you to know
I'm not afraid no
I'm safe with you
And I don't wanna be alone
Cause you're the only one for me
And I'm finding it hard to breathe here breathe here
You could be the only way out of this place that I'm in
It's like I'm living a bad dream bad dream
And only you can wake me yeah
I've been sleeping with the light on
Like I'm afraid of the dark
Afraid of a broken heart
I don't wanna break your heart
No no no oh
I've got a phobia of being without ya
I've got a phobia of being alone
It's only a matter of time girl
Before I break down
Because I can't start being without ya
I've got a phobia of letting you go
And I want you to know
I'm not afraid no
I'm safe with you oh oh oh oh
