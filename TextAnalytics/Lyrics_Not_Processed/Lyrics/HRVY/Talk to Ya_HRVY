[Intro]
I just wanna talk to ya, talk to ya
Take it for my broken paradise

[Verse 1]
Girl, I know you're more than just a number
I know when I look into your eyes
See I can love you more than any other
I know you've been hurt, I'll make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's hard to trust someone like me
When it's my reputation that's first to speak
I won’t make a promise I can’t keep
'Cause I can give you somethin' that you never had before

[Chorus]
I just wanna talk to ya, talk to ya
Maybe I can mend your heart with mine
I just wanna talk to ya, talk to ya
Take it for my broken paradise

You hit you like a wave girl an pull me under
Don't give me a chance to escape
I just wanna talk to ya, talk to ya
Take it for my broken paradise

[Verse 2]
I know everybody if you want it
I don't blame them, I don't trust myself
But, this ain't just like any other morning
And you ain't just like any other girl

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's hard to trust someone like me
When it's my reputation that's first to speak
I won’t make a promise I can’t keep
'Cause I can give you somethin' that you never had before

[Chorus]
I just wanna talk to ya, talk to ya
Maybe I can mend your heart with mine
I just wanna talk to ya, talk to ya
Take it for my broken paradise

You hit me like a way you've gotta pull me under
Don't give me a chance to escape
I just wanna talk to ya, talk to ya
Take it for my broken paradise

[Chorus]
I just wanna talk to ya, talk to ya
Maybe I can mend your heart with mine
I just wanna talk to ya, talk to ya
Take it for my broken paradise
