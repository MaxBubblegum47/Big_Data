[Intro: RM]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(
Kio, Kio
)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: RM]
I got the homis in my bag (Yeah)
Have you heard of that? (Yeah)
Homis made of steel, from Korea, they the be-e-est
Ridin' to the farm (Huh)
Grabbin' all the corn (Huh)
We gon' get yo' money with my homi in your backyard

[Chorus: Lil Nas X 
with RM
]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Outro: RM]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
