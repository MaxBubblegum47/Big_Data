[Intro: Travis Barker]
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
You, and me
Yeah, we gotta fix this family
And I know it's hard
But oh, we at least gotta start

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family, you see
It takes two to get to three, relieved
We're gonna leave here happily
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family, you see
It takes two to get to three, relieved
We're gonna leave here happily

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
You (Yes you, yes you) and me (And me)
Yeah we, make pods, we the peas
Now let's go (Let's go, let's go), get knee (Get knee)
Your knee is deep in happy fantasies (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family, you see
It takes two to get to three, relieved
We're gonna leave here happily
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family, you see
It takes two to get to three, relieved
We're gonna leave here happily

[Bridge: Lil Nas X]
You and me, you best believe
-ily, you see
Get to three, relieve
We're gonna leave here happily

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Travis Barker]
Yeah, you and me, my friend, you best believe
We gotta fix this family, you see
It takes two to get to three, relieved
We're gonna leave here happily

[Outro: Wes Donehower & Lil Nas X]
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Off beat, off beat
Who's off? Is it me?
I don't think it's you, hold on, hold on
