[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
A one, two, three

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
I'll stop the world when I'm with you
Nothin' to hate, nothin' to lose
Put down the loaded guns, and socialize with everyone
I'll stop the war when I'm with you
So tell 'em, say

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Ooh (Hey)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
Weight on my back with every noose
Can't hide the fact, it made me lose, oh
We must tell everyone, then maybe we can have some fun
And I'm thankful that you saw me through
And tell 'em, say

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Nas X]
Ooh, ooh, ooh (
Hey
)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
