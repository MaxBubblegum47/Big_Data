[Verse 1]
I give a little into the moment
Like I'm standing at the edge, I know
That no one's gonna turn me around
Just one more step, I could let go
Oh, and in the middle
I hear the voices and they're calling for me now, I know
That nothing's gonna wake me now
'Cause I'm a slave to the sound

[Chorus 1]
And they're calling
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up
And I'll never look back
Just hold your head up
And if it gets rough
It's time to get rough
They keep saying
Don't stop, no, it's never enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough
It's time to get rough

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, but now I'm falling
Falling (falling)
Falling
Falling
Falling (falling)
Falling
Falling
Falling (falling)
Falling
Falling, oh

[Verse 2]
Now I'm going down
And I can feel the eyes are watching
Oh so closely, oh
I'm trying not to make a sound
'Cause I'll be found out somehow

[Chorus 1]
So keep calling
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up
And I'll never look back
Just hold your head up
And if it gets rough
It's time to get rough
They keep saying
Don't stop, no, it's never enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough
It's time to get rough
(Oh, but now I'm falling)

[Chorus 2]
Into the fire, feeling higher than the truth (I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning (But now I'm falling)
Fear and desire feed the tired, hungry tooth (I'm falling)
Feels like I'm falling away
I can hear them calling for me (But now I'm falling)
Into the fire feeling higher than the truth (I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning (But now I'm falling)
Fear and desire feed the tired, hungry tooth (I'm falling)
Feels like I'm falling, yeah
I can hear them calling for me (But now I'm falling)

[Post-Chorus]
Falling (falling)
Falling
Falling
Falling (falling)
Falling
Falling
Falling (falling)
Falling
Falling
Oh, but now I'm falling
Falling (falling)
Falling
Falling
Falling (falling)
Falling
Falling
Falling (falling)
Falling
Falling
Oh, but now I'm falling

[Bridge]
Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling
But now I'm falling
Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling
Oh, but now I'm falling

[Chorus 2]
Into the fire, feeling higher than the truth (But now I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning, yeah (I'm falling)
Fear and desire feed the tired, hungry tooth (But now I'm falling)
Feels like I'm falling away
I can hear them calling for me (Falling)
Into the fire, feeling higher than the truth (But now I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning, yeah (I'm falling)
Fear and desire feed the tired, hungry tooth (But now I'm falling)
Feels like I'm falling away
I can hear them calling for me (Now I'm falling)

[Outro]
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
I'll never give up, I'll never give up (But now I'm falling)
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up (I'm falling)
Never look back, never give up
I'll never give up, I'll never give up (But now I'm falling)
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up (I'm falling)
Never look back, never give up
I'll never give up, I'll never give up (But now I'm falling)
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up (Falling)
Never look back, never give up
I'll never give up, I'll never give up (But now I'm falling)
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
I'll never give up, I'll never give up
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
Never look back, never give up
I'll never give up, I'll never give up
