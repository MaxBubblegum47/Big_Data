[Verse 1]
Hey you!
Remember me? Remember love?
Remember trying to stay together?
My time, you took it all
You tried to see
You tried to bring yourself up without involving me
It isn't fair, to have your way
To try and get up and go
And na-na-na-na now, can't you see
It isn't fair, to have your way?
But I'm trying to get your attention
I need you to know that

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey you! Hey you!
Can't you make this sane?
I know, I know, I know
You ain't the one to play the game
Now I know I'm never gonna go your way
If you go, well, now I know
I know, know, know

[Chorus]
Forever we tried to make it right
Together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word, then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No, I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

[Verse 2]
I don't want to turn around
So come on, baby
Come on and try to let it out
Let go
We're still the same
So come on, baby
Trigger the sound, let's figure it out
Let's get back to where we started out

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey you! Hey you!
Can't you make this sane?
I know, I know, I know
You ain't the one to play the game
Now I know I'm never gonna go your way
If you go, well, now I know
I know, know, know

[Chorus]
Forever we tried to make it right
Together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word, then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No, I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

[Bridge]
Go, go, go, go, get out, get out of my memory
No, no, no, not tonight, I don't have the energy
Go, go, go, go, get out, get out of my memory
No, no, no, not tonight, oh, not tonight, oh, not tonight

[Chorus]
Forever we tried to make it right
Together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word, then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No, I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right
Forever we tried to make it right
But together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word, then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No, I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

[Outro]
Forever we tried, forever we tried, yeah
Forever we tried, forever we tried, yeah
Forever we tried, forever we, forever we tried, yeah
Forever we tried, forever we tried, yeah
