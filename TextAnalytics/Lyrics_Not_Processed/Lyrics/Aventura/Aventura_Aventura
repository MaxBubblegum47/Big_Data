Don't ya get tired of them talking about us
We talk bad and we talk good
You are just making us more famouse
Just love my fans , I even love the hatters you know
Im use to it
Sometimes it just feels that
If we weren't Aventura
Trabajo en la fritura
You wouldn't speak of us
And all these girls all love us -
Do they really really love us?
Cause in school it wasn't like this
Y hoy todo cambio
No me conoces solos escuchas mi voz
You don't know me
You haven't spoke to none of us
Como te atreves a llamarme comparon
Yo soy humilde tengo buen corazon
Para llegar a la fama
Tienes que ser un campeon
We've been booed out of stage
And look at us
You can't stop us you can't fade us
I love my fans but fuck the haters
This industry is full of hate and love
Hoy me siento ser el mas popular
Pero no olvido mi barrio
Holla back mi gente hermosa
Que tanto quiero;
Dominicano, Puertorrique√±o
Gracias a Dios, gracias a Mami
Gracias Papa
Sometimes it just feels that
If we weren't Aventura
Trabajo en la fritura
You wouldn't speak of us
And all these girls all love us -
Do they really really love us?
Cause in school it wasn't like this
Y hoy todo cambio
Because of you we're number one -
Que me ames o me odies
Because of you we're number one -
And we'll be together always
Because of you we're number one -
Los envidiosos listen up
We invented this style
Let me find out
Jc get ready for the heat
Oh to all the new groups
We ainght hatting on ya
Good luck
We only wanted some respect
Sometimes it just feels that
If we weren't Aventura
Trabajo en la fritura
You wouldn't speak of us
And all these girls all love us -
Do they really really love us?
Cause in school it wasn't like this
Y hoy todo cambio
Sometimes it just feels that
If we weren't Aventura
Trabajo en la fritura
You wouldn't speak of us
And all these girls all love us -
Do they really really love us?
Cause in school it wasn't like this
