To me you were more than just a lover
I made you part of all my dreams
I bragged to my fellas about you
I made you my wifey, mother of my kids
Why you have to play yourself by playin me?
You disrespected me like if I was a kid
Why you have to fu***' lie?
You brung out the bad in me
I never thought it could be
That you would be cheating on me
Called me the girl of your dreams
Kissed me at night and said you loved me
I know that I did it to you
But only after I knew
That you were just a game
And you better believe that I ain't gonna play
Go go leave
'Cause I don't need you
You're acting, you're lying
Tu eres la culpable
I can't trust you no more
Hell no
Why you pointin fingers at me
I'm pointin fingers at you cause I saw you kissin him
I read your diary and letters
Boy I found out you were a player
You wanna make up stories whatever
You proved to me we can't be together
Like I said I read your diary and letter
Boy I found out you were a player
You wanna make up stories whatever
You proved to me we can't be together
How could I ever believe when you're always out on the street
Don't answer your calls from me
Dial your number, your phone just rings
I am wondering who is she
You sayin I'm digging too deep
Just accept the consequence
Don't be upset
You just got what you gave
Go go leave
Cause I don't need you
You're acting, you're lying
Tu eres la culpable
I can't trust you no more
Hell no
Why you pointin fingers at me
I'm pointin fingers at you cause I saw you kissin him
Nina te di amor y confianza
Fuiste mi primer amor
Y me rompiste con mentiras
Puras mentiras el corazon
You said I was your inspiration
And I could tell you really cared
But if you really value my heart
You would have always been there
I'm tired of all the lonely nights
Wishing you were by my side
It was instantly
'Cause my body needs you
It don't mean nothin
I'm still gonna leave ya
