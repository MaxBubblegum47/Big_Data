[Letra de "Our Song"]

[Intro]
Have you ever loved someone so much
That even though you know you got to go
You just don't know how to let go?
That's how I feel about her
(Come on, come on, come on, come on...)
Hey
It's your Romeo, girl
Y Aventura

[Verso 1]
If tomorrow you feel lonely, it's ok
Te prometo, princesita, volvere
Please stop your crying, se me va el avión
When you miss me pon nuestra canción

[Coro]
Aquella cancion de amor que nos fascina a los dos
The song we always play when we make sweet love
Me da pena, sorry that I have to go
No me digas adios
Sometimes in life you don't get what you want
Me duele mucho tenerme que alejar
Baby girl, you know well you're my boo
Y te prometo que en mi mente estaras tú
Aquella cancion de amor que nos fascina a los dos
The song we always play when we make sweet love
Me da pena, sorry that I have to go
No me digas adios

[Refrán]
Tell me that you'll miss me
Tell me that you love me and you need me
Say it, girl, before I go
Dime que me amas
Dime que de lejos que tú me extranas
Dime esas palabras
Me voy, mi amor
Tell me that you'll miss me
Tell me that you love me and you need me
Say it, girl, before I go

[Interludio]
I'm here, a playboy
(Come on, come on, come on, come on...)
You know I love you girl

[Verso 2]
Mi cielo, it's not over, don't you cry
Con tu mirada y tu tristeza voy a llorar
Yo sé que piensas que esto ya llego al final
Pero en tu radio you will hear our lullaby

[Coro]
Y aquella cancion de amor que nos fascina a los dos
The song we always play when we make sweet love
Me da pena, sorry that I have to go
No me digas adios
(Please don't say goodbye)

[Refrán]
Tell me that you'll miss me
Tell me that you love me and you need me
Say it, girl, before I go
Dime que me amas
Dime que de lejos que tú me extranas
Dime esas palabras
Me voy, mi amor
Tell me that you'll miss me
Tell me that you love me and you need me
Say it, girl, before I go

[Outro]
Aventura
