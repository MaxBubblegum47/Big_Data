[Letra de "Volvió La Traicionera"]

[Verso 1]
Ya volvió la cualquiera, traicionera, mujerzuela
La que me causó la pena, que cambió mi vida entera
Que no me dirija un palabra, porque no respondo de mí
Esto no se trata de machismo
Una dama y una diabla no es lo mismo
Bendita sean todas sólo por haber nacido mujer
Pero a la mierda las mando si son infiel
Cuidadito si cuentas la historia como no es
Por bandida te boté

[Coro]
Don't come around here 'cause it's over
You took me for granted and that was wrong
You know me well, don't test my knowledge
No chance, 
go, go
Don't come around here 'cause it's over
You took me for granted and that was wrong
You know me well, don't test my knowledge
No chance, 
go, go

[Interludio]
No vuelvas aquí, traicionera
Mentirosa
It's over, girl
Go, go
She won't forget Romeo, ah-ah
Aventura

[Coro]
Don't come around here 'cause it's over
You took me for granted and that was wrong
You know me well, don't test my knowledge
No chance, 
go, go
Don't come around here 'cause it's over
You took me for granted and that was wrong
You know me well, don't test my knowledge
No chance, 
go, go

[Interludio]
¿Qué es lo que tú te crees?, bandida
It's over
Go, go

[Verso 2]
Dile al pueblo, cuentale la historia, la verdadera versión
Que jugaste con mis sentimientos, admite tu error
En tu barrio saben que me fuiste infiel
Se comenta tu traición
Un día mi padre me lo dijo y hoy le doy la razón
El que cree en mujeres cree en el Diablo, no se equivoco
No me exijas oportunidades
Sorry, my love (You did me wrong)

[Coro]
Don't come around here 'cause it's over
You took me for granted and that was wrong
You know me well, don't test my knowledge
No more chances, 
go, go
Don't come around here 'cause it's over
You took me for granted and that was wrong
You know me well, don't test my knowledge
Se acabó, 
go, go

[Outro]
Uuh!
That's the [?] right there
No more
Don't come around here 'cause it's over
Nah, nah, nah
Don't test my knowledge, go, go
Aventura
You see, Lenny?
I might have to [?] the beat
She wanna come and play me like that
Go, go
She played me 'cause I was weak
But now I'm feeling strong
That's right, yeah
Playboy
Throw the beat right there
Lenny Melody
Bananas
No more chances
