[Verse 1]
(
Cheap queen
)
I've been alright
I've just been doing the same shit I've always liked 
(
Smiling for the audience
)
Like smoking and movies and homies who bring me wine
I've been going out too much 
(
Queen
)
And talking 'bout myself too much 
(Oh, 
smiling for the audience
)

[Chorus]
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry

[Verse 2]
Makin' my name (
Queen
)
All of my girls get up early and stay out late (
Queen
)
They drive all the way to the west side to see my face (
How did I do it?
)
That's good love (Good love, good love)
And I ain't no big baller when it's fake friends you're callin'

[Chorus]
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry

[Bridge]
I'm gettin' too cocky since everyone wants me (
Queen
)
It's harder to be myself (
Queen, queen
)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (
Smiling
)
But I see you love me (
Queen
)
It's better than money to know that you call me out (
Cheap queen
)
But when the money's out
I can make grown men cry

[Chorus]
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry

[Outro]
Queen
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (
Smiling for the audience
)
Queen
Cheap queen, queen
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (
Smiling for the audience
)
How did I do it?
Queen
