[Verse 1]
Hey, my love
Buried you a month or two ago
I keep thinking that you're standing on my floor
That you're waiting there for me
Hey, my love
You've walked out a hundred times
, how was I
Supposed to know this time that you wouldn't come
That you wouldn't come home

[Chorus]
But four drinks I'm wasted
I can see you dancing, I can lay down next to you
At the foot of my bed
If I drink enough
I can taste your lipstick
, I can lay down next to you
But it's all in my head
If I drink enough I swear that I will wake up next to you

[Verse 2]
When you left, you took my bestest friends away
And in this mess, I think I dug a thousand graves
Talia, I hope you're happy anyway

[Chorus]
But four drinks I'm wasted
I can see you dancing, I can lay down next to you
At the foot of my bed
If I drink enough
I can taste your lipstick, I can lay down next to you
But it's all in my head
If I drink enough I swear that I will wake up next to you

[Bridge]
Broke my heart now I'm wasting my time on you
Broke my heart now I'm wasting my time
If I drink enough
I can see you dancing, I can lay down next to you
At the foot of my bed
If I drink enough
I can taste your lipstick, I can lay down next to you
But it's all in my head

[Chorus]
But four drinks I'm wasted
I can see you dancing, I can lay down next to you
At the foot of my bed
If I drink enough
I can taste your lipstick, I can lay down next to you
But it's all in my head
If I drink enough I swear that I will wake up next to you
