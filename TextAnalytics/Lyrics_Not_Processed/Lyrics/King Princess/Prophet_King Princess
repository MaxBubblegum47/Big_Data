[Verse 1]
You call when you want it
Everyone wants something from your soul on the molly
Someone's friend is talking like they know, oh, you’re on it
I just want to be your pretty girl when you want it

[Chorus]
'Cause I can only think about you
And what it's like to walk around you
And why they like to talk about you
’Cause I can only think about you

[Verse 2]
You know what you want
It's only 'bout the money and control
Can't step off it, someone else will cop it
Like it's gold, you're a prophet
Someone's gonna profit
Don't you know I just want it, uh

[Chorus]
I can only think about you
And what it’s like to walk around you
And why they like to talk about you
’Cause I can only think about you
'Cause I can only think about you
And what it’s like to walk around you
And why they like to talk about you
'Cause I can only think about you

[Bridge]
Oh, no apologies, twisting your word and your prophecy
Oh, and honestly, it's the price of the prodigy you wanna be
Oh, no apologies, twisting your words and your prophecy
Oh, and honestly

[Chorus]
I can only think about you
And what it's like to walk around you
And why they like to talk about you
’Cause I can only think about you
'Cause I can only think about you
And what it's like to walk around you
And why they like to talk about you
'Cause I can only think about you

[Outro]
Oh, think about you
(It's the price of the prodigy you wanna be)
Thinking about you
(Do-do-do)
Think about
(It's the price of the prodigy you wanna be)
Oh, thinking about you, oh
(It's the price of the prodigy you wanna be)
'Cause I can only think about you
(It's the price of the prodigy you wanna be)
Oh, I can only think about you, yeah
