[Verse 1]
Let me run with you tonight
I'll take you on a moonlight ride
There's someone I used to see
But she don't give a damn for me

[Chorus 1]
But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

[Verse 2]
People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up in between
A memory and a dream

[Chorus 2]
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
And let's head on down the road, there's somewhere I gotta go
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

[Verse 3]
My old man was born to rock
He's still tryin' to beat the clock
Think of me what you will
I've got a little space to fill

[Chorus 2]
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
And let's head on down the road, there's somewhere I gotta go
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
No, you don't know how it feels to be me
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
No, you don't know how it feels to be me
