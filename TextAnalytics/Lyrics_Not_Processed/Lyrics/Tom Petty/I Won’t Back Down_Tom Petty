[Verse 1]
Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
No, I'll stand my ground
Won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down

[Chorus]
I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey I will stand my ground
And I won't back down

[Verse 2]
Well I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I'll stand my ground
And I won't back down

[Chorus]
I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
(I won't back down)
And I won't back down

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I won't back down
I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
(I won't back down)
And I won't back down
(I won't back down)
No, I won't back down
