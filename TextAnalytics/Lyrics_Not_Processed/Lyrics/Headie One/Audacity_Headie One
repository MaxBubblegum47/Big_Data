[Intro: Stormzy]
It's like
You niggas audacious
Hmm
Yeah

[Chorus: Stormzy]
I roll out with no cash on me
Calm now with no mash on me
Stay away from these ashy youts
'Fore they come around and get ash on me
That's five thousand capacity
Five thousand capacity
Then spread that over the UK
And then add it up and get back to me
You pussios are not bad for me
Mad man, they go mad for me
Who the fuck went an' gassed you up
Like you're good enough to be clashin' me?
Oh, please stop harrassin' me
Charge me up and put gas in me
Them likkle fish want to try ting
Oh, man, the audacity

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
I got girl in my inbox sendin' me eyes
Livin' on the edge 'til the end of our lives
Wolf in a sheepskin tellin' me lies
Sometimes I love when my enemy dies
Woo, so ahead of my time
Mainstream boy starts lettin' off lie
We can never, ever, ever level in price
Take that fee, and then treble it twice, yeah
The problem's back, I got flows
Watch your back, I'm on smoke
Dodge the paps and do boat
My boys are maximum boast
Ain't no time to bly man
Know my ting from here to Thailand
You man got that gun off my man
So you man got that gun on finance
Like what's this rented skeng? Buy your own
Use my pen to skeng-fry your dome
Want me to send for them, mind the throne
Cliché, rep your ends, die alone
Cliché, run your guns and die broke
I don't buy in ones, I buy bulk
Yeah, go and bust your gun, I like smoke
Rude boy, mind ya lungs, you might choke
Like cough, cough, puff, puff, pass
You're not tough or hard
They callin' me the virgin Mike
How the hell I bust so fast?
Rude boy, I came and shook my whole era
No cosigns for me and no carers
2019 and I swear I'm goin' clearer
Jar full of dead MCs like Paul Bearer

[Chorus: Stormzy & Headie One]
I roll out with no cash on me
Calm now with no mash on me
Stay away from these ashy youts
'Fore they come around and get ash on me
That's five thousand capacity
Five thousand capacity
Then spread that over the UK
And then add it up and get back to me
You pussios are not bad for me
Mad man, they go mad for me
Who the fuck went an' gassed you up
Like you're good enough to be clashin' me?
Oh, please stop harrassin' me
Charge me up and put gas in me
Them likkle fish want to try ting
Oh, man, the audacity (Turn)

[Verse 2: Headie One]
Had to slang this 'caine, no Harry
Now my track suit says Balmain Paris (One)
Smoke on bro, no Cali
So you better stay well back, Danny (One)
Oh, now we got beef in the streets
And I thought it'd only be in my patty (Turn)
'Cause I learned how to work this handy
Knowledge is power, ask Gandhi (Turn, turn, turn)
I was with the bro eatin' jollof at aunties
I told her I'm tryna be the best I can be (Turn, turn, turn)
Next day, I go end up on the opp block
Like who's on me, Chale?
Come off the wing like Andros Townsend (Turn)
I bought her a new hanny and it cost four thousand (Turn, turn)
Kept it close, paigons wanna out me (Turn, turn, turn)
They want me in a box like chicken chow mein
I wonder why opps wanna try me
Why feds put me in court and trial me?
Bad B's get bored and dial me
And ask when we're goin' to the niz, I'm like, "Shall we?"
Laid back, but still rowdy
Same goons from throwback still 'round me (One)
Funny how my old tings still shout me (One)
Oh, 'low me
Roll out, it's so casually
I'm poppin' up in cities randomly
London City or Birmingham
I just done a hundred through Canterbury (Turn)
No security, I could have a twenty in cash on me (Turn)
Trident can't believe I'm lege
So they're in the house like they're Ali G (Turn, turn, turn)

[Chorus: Stormzy]
I roll out with no cash on me
Calm now with no mash on me
Stay away from these ashy youts
'Fore they come around and get ash on me
That's five thousand capacity
Five thousand capacity
Then spread that over the UK
And then add it up and get back to me
You pussios are not bad for me
Mad man, they go mad for me
Who the fuck went an' gassed you up
Like you're good enough to be clashin' me?
Oh, please stop harrassin' me
Charge me up and put gas in me
Them likkle fish want to try ting
Oh, man, the audacity

[Outro: Stormzy]
Oh man, the audacity
Oh man, the audacity
Oh, it's a catastrophe
I changed the game drastically
Big Mike cut down Glastonbury (Big Mike)
Flashbacks from Glastonbury (Woo)
Love it when it all comes back to me (Yeah)
Telling lies, not facts on me
I roll out with no spesh on me
God's son, this is flesh on me
Stay away from these paigon youts
Cah many men, they wish death on me
When Banksy put the vest on me
Felt like God was testin' me
When Banksy put the vest on me
Felt like God was testin' me
