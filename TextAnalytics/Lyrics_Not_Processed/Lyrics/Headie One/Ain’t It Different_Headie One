[Chorus: Lady Saw & 
Headie One
]
(Baby, are you up for this?)
(Ready for the bump and grind)
(Baby, are you up for this?)
Suh, suh, s-s-s-suh
(B-B-B-Baby, are you up for this?)

[Verse 1: Headie One]
Ain't it different? (One) I link my ting in LA
But I can't fly to the States 'cah I got too much convictions (Jheeze)
Apparently all I talk is prison, but I don't know no different
 (No)
'Cah I was in jail up north, runnin' another coalition (Turn)
Fresh home, I bought coke and whipped it
I put some roses where my wrist is
You ain't ever made a birthday cake from Digestive biscuits (Told me turm, ayy)
Will have to take lemon juice to a piss test (Piss test, s-s-s-suh)
Every day I look up to the Lord, give thanks for all this litness (Turn, turn, turn, turn)
Come home, fresh out the system, gymnast
Rollin' with smoke on my jones
Pigs want all the camera on me, not the one from Dipset (One)
I still can't mix pleasure with business, sorry, princess (Princess)
I come a long way from broke days (Turn, turn)
I got to work and fixed it

[Chorus: Lady Saw & 
Headie One
]
Baby, are you up for this?
I am feeling hot tonight
Ready for the bump and grind
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah
Baby, are you up for this? (
Ain't it different?
)
I am feeling hot tonight (
Turn, turn, turn, turn
)
Ready for the bump and grind
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah (
Suh, suh, s-s-s-suh
)

[Verse 2: AJ Tracey]
Ain't it different? (Yeah)
Spent like ten years grindin' (Facts)
Covered in diamonds, never been minin'
Came through, man's still shinin' (Blaow)
'Cah I was in Homeford House with the pack (Pack)
And now I'm in Dubai, limin' (Vroom)
Me and Headz landed abroad, two new kettles, perfect timin' (Perfect)
The new whip's white on white, peanut butter, rose gold linin' (Skrrt)
You can catch me in Central (Let's go)
Car so dumb, when I press this button, it's gone, I don't do rentals (I pay)
Air 1's fresher than menthol
 (They're fresh)
I don't wanna get shit lit, but the way that bro grip sticks ain't gentle (Brrt)
Summer time shootouts, big big loot-outs
Get corn stuck in your dental

[Chorus: Lady Saw & 
Headie One
]
Baby, are you up for this? (Ooh, ooh)
I am feeling hot tonight (Ooh, ooh)
Ready for the bump and grind (Ooh, ooh)
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah
Baby, are you up for this? (Ooh, ooh, 
ain't it different?
)
I am feeling hot tonight (Ooh, ooh, 
ayy, ayy
)
Ready for the bump and grind (Ooh, ooh)
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah (
Turn, turn, turn, turn
)

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
Ain't it different? (Different)
When I first stepped in the game (Game)
Man tried leech on my name, now they wanna act all distant (Ah)
Man love smile in my face and then they wanna chat like vixens (Huh?)
It's good, it's not back in the day, woulda got yourself wrapped on Clifton
I don't really take no checks, I'll warn you
And I don't do threats, I'm cordial
I don't even Snap on the jet, it's normal
Black tie, but I'm dressed informal (Boy)
Like the boys from East, I'm nasty
Don't do drip, but I still stay classy
You wanna know, then ask me, easy

[Chorus: Lady Saw & 
Headie One
]
Baby, are you up for this? (Ooh, ooh, 
One
)
I am feeling hot tonight (Ooh, ooh)
Ready for the bump and grind (Ooh, ooh)
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah
Baby, are you up for this? (
Ain't it different, one
, ooh, ooh)
I am feeling hot tonight (Ooh, ooh)
Ready for the bump and grind (Ooh, ooh)
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah (
Turn, turn, turn, turn
)

[Outro: Lady Saw]
