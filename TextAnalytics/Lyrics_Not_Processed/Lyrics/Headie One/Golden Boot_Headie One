Turn, turn

[Chorus]
Bad B come to the niz
Skin all gold, she cute (Turn, turn, turn, turn)
How's her boyfriend pissed 'cause she know my tunes?
I need me a skeng, I can't fit it in the ride (Su, su, su, su)
We might have to slide with an open boot
Scored all of these points this season (Turn, turn)
OFB won the Golden Boot (They told me turn)
Still do it how I did it with Scat (Su, su, su, su)
We've already worn those boots
Opps see the offside flag (One)
Come like they forgot their boots
Them man there selective bad boys (Su, su)
I really don't know how they pick and choose (Su, su)
The whole gang spent bands on boots (Turn, turn)
Them man can't afford no boots (They told me turn, One)

[Verse 1]
I'm married to Elizabeth, that's my wife (Shawty)
Anyting green get bun, still do it like I done it like half my life (Bow!)
Any sight of the goal man shoot (Su, su, su, su)
Perform this excellent finish, I do it like Kane or Lukaku (One)
Old school like Bergkamp and Henry
Ammuniton stays on me
Keep an eye out for undies (Told me turn)
Sawn-off cost me a monkey (Told me turn)
Opposition wish they can touch me
I remember pedal bike days and the kitchen knife getting frontied
Now man just fly out the front seat
Opps know that the gang too dumpy (Gang)
Age 17 in country, me and Jay like Lucas and Bumpy (One)
My first phone call's my alarm clock, the line too jumpy (Turn, turn)
I told my young boys fly upsee (One)
I hit shots from far like Roberto Carlos (Told me turn, ay)
All I do is organise orders, come like I work in Argos (Told me turn)
I do it for the bread no hard-dough (One)
Headie One need a reload in cargo, still tryna do it like they did it in Narcos
I put weight on my phone, no cardio (They told me turn)
Opps see me in the flesh and they can't help when their heart goes (One)
All we did is pressure these opps, now they can't stand in the field like Marlo

[Chorus 2]
Bad B come to the niz
Skin all gold, she cute (Turn, turn, turn, turn)
How's her boyfriend pissed 'cause she know my tunes?
I need me a skeng, I can't fit it in the ride (Su, su, su, su)
We might have to slide with an open boot
Scored all of these points this season (Turn, turn)
OFB, OFB, OFB

[Verse 2]
Free Bradz, that's my guy
Someone tell RV to controlla
I was on basic coping
Touch road and these tyres got broken
Me and this 4s like Krept and Konan (One)
They soon touch the road all swollen
Bet he's gonna want his boots all golden (Free up)
Can't tell the gang about scoring (One)
Been over them sides there, tryna tear shirts open like Hulk Hogan (Turn, turn, turn, turn)
I gotta burn my clothing and dodge the wing cah I like my bread toasted (They told me turn)
Dem man hope to my downfall and all now they're still hoping (They told me turn)
Back then I tried smoke with a sawny' and all now I'm still smoking
Just done a whole night shift and all now they're still calling (One)
T-house looking all scary, have you ever watched Conjuring?
And that's all for the bread and wine
That's even those far from holy (Reddies)
Mask on my face
They could've been Cactus Jack or Mick Foley (Bow!)

[Chorus]
Bad B come to the niz
Skin all gold, she cute (Turn, turn, turn, turn)
How's her boyfriend pissed 'cause she know my tunes?
I need me a skeng, I can't fit it in the ride (Su, su, su, su)
We might have to slide with an open boot
Scored all of these points this season (Turn, turn)
OFB won the Golden Boot (They told me turn)
Still do it how I did it with Scat (Su, su, su, su)
We've already worn those boots
Opps see the offside flag (One)
Come like they forgot their boots
Them man there selective bad boys (Su, su)
I really don't know how they pick and choose (Su, su)
The whole gang spent bands on boots (Turn, turn)
Them man can't afford no boots (They told me turn, ay)
