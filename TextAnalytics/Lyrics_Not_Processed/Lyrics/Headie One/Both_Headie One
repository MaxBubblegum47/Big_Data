[Intro]
Pipe it up PJ
Nastylgia

[Chorus]
T house up north or near the coast, rudeboy, there’s both
Spend this bread on jewels or spend it on smoke
Man spend it on both
Counting up this money from O or money from shows
Man's counting up both
Paps need a pattern business and a pattern up home
Man patternin' both
Feds draw me out for a works and smoke
Tryna do me for both
They want me back on soch', using chips and rice
Tryna pattern me both
But I'm on road, yellow bones, brown ones, I get loving from both
Money and success, just let a young nigga go govern up both

[Verse 1]
Me and T Buck see two opps on the mains
And we ended up doing up both
Too much beef on the streets
We're hitting two blocks and we're shooting up both
I know feds want me back up in courts
Sat in front of the judge just doing up oath
How many times in jail was it bread and oats?
Put peanut butter on both
Now they say that I'm the king of drill
Trap, rap, I'm doing it all
Everywhere and everywhere, the gang's smokey
Let the gangdem bring it on tour
Everyday I hear niggas tryna draw me out
Why they all want me to war?
.44 long and that poisonous scopes
They don't want us bringing out both

[Pre-Chorus]
Come look at the table, it's a lawn chair
I had go get, traphouse really had no air
You was out clubbin' with nowhere
OT, I had to go there
But then I ain't done a show here
Remember I had plans to go near
In the fast lane, I don't know where

[Chorus]
T house up north or near the coast, rudeboy, there’s both
Spend this bread on jewels or spend it on smoke
Man spend it on both
Counting up this money from O or money from shows
Man's counting up both
Paps need a pattern business and a pattern up home
Man patternin' both
Feds draw me out for a works and smoke
Tryna do me for both
They want me back on soch', using chips and rice
Tryna pattern me both
But I'm on road, yellow bones, brown ones, I get loving from both
Money and success, just let a young nigga go govern up both

[Verse 2]
I just dial up bro for a half a B and tell him pattern up coke
How many long afternoons did I spend in the T just bagging up both?
Jailhouse, scrambling eggs in a kettle
Just wishing I could have it with toast
I couldn't tell you how weak was a sunday roast
Rice pudding all in that bowl
See this life of sin, I'm just tryna make sure my heart stays pure
Feds had me locked for time
Evidence they would never find like Jah Cure
I was tryna get rich or die, fuck tryin'
I'd rather be dead than poor
I'm really out 'ere tryna govern it all
Money, power, respect and more

[Pre-Chorus]
Come look at the table, it's a lawn chair
I had go get, traphouse really had no air
You was out clubbin' with nowhere
OT, I had to go there
But then I ain't done a show here
Remember I had plans to go near
In the fast lane, I don't know where

[Chorus]
T house up north or near the coast, rudeboy, there’s both
Spend this bread on jewels or spend it on smoke
Man spend it on both
Counting up this money from O or money from shows
Man's counting up both
Paps need a pattern business and a pattern up home
Man patternin' both
Feds draw me out for a works and smoke
Tryna do me for both
They want me back on soch', using chips and rice
Tryna pattern me both
But I'm on road, yellow bones, brown ones, I get loving from both
Money and success, just let a young nigga go govern up both

[Outro]
Both
Money and success, just let a young nigga go govern up both
