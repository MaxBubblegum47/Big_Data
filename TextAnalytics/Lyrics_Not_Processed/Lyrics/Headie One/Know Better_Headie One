[Intro: Headie One]
They should know better
They should know better
They should know better
Melo Beats
Traphouse Mob

[Chorus: Headie One]
Bad B on the Nizz
You really think I went upsie for scrum?
Live corn in the shh
I could’ve let it in the uni room (Shh)
But I know better
Opps wanna see me get nicked with a shh
But I know better
Next day shh got-got by shh (Bow)
Gang done got down two this week, that's shh and shh
They should know better
Don’t see me in the flesh and don’t make man leak
Man do shit for the 'gram and tweet
Man rise that shh and skeet
How many: shh, shh, shh, shh? Let's see (One)

[Verse 1: Headie One]
Man could’ve put it on the net
When gang done chinged up shh (Shh)
And the bros didn’t neither
Man just left it to the media (Simple)
They say I took a L in L (Turn-turn)
But shh made a W in W (Turn-turn)
Anything green get wah, then oh lord (What?)
Know better
Anything shh, shh, excellent finish, Mo Salah (Turn)
How man tell me buss my shh?
Only cah they know I’m on camera
They want me in the bin, Osama (Turn)
That would’ve been four summers

[Bridge: Headie One]
Let me know if your favourite rapper would've shh, shh, shh
You feel me? Still out here B
Lobster, steak and these things (Turn-turn-turn)
One

[Verse 2: Headie One]
Old friends doing up commentary
But they forgot that shh got shh
Then they came over here with the mandem
And that’s just becah Abz made "Robbery" (Turn-turn-turn-turn-turn-turn-turn-turn)
Everybody do it for the net so much
They forget to go do their job properly
Shh done chinged down shh
Put one on the wing, I was playin' Monopoly (One)
Still see me on the opp block open toe (Trackie and sliders)
I could’ve put shh on the net
When I had man crashin' on Croyland Road

[Chorus: Headie One]
Bad B on the Nizz
You really think I went upsie for scrum?
Live corn in the shh
I could’ve let it in the uni room (Shh)
But I know better
Opps wanna see me get nicked with a shh
But I know better
Next day shh got-got by shh (Bow)
Gang done got down two this week, that's shh and shh
They should know better
Don’t see me in the flesh and don’t make man leak
Man do shit for the 'gram and tweet
Man rise that shh and skeet
How many: shh, shh, shh, shh? Let's see (One)

[Verse 3: RV]
OFB run Tottenham (OFB)
And I love my team like a Spurs fan (Ah)
Get 'round there and try burst man (Boom)
Blue Nile or I hit Kervans (Everywhere)
Them boy there neeks
Cheff game on fleek
Just copped new sweets
Straight cash, no deets
My strap got grease
Still stack them P’s
Ring, trap all week (Trapping)
Got beef in the streets
So I invest in shells (Loaded)
Had man changing their bio
Hashtag your bredrin's world (Haha)
Try put gang on a vid (Then what?)
Twenty-four hours later
Shh got slapped with a stick (Oh well)
Now opps can’t stand on their strip (No way)
All now I don’t know who my paigons are
Cah them man don’t wanna buck me (runners)
My niggas keep up with fuckery
Slide round there with that brucky (Boo!)
Fry man like it’s Kentucky
If I don’t hit one then they’re lucky (Lucky)
If I don’t hit one then they’re lucky
But I’m still gonna try my best (Real talk)
Blow my ting and take him out the game
I’m like the ref (Red card)
In the field I slide on them
But I ain’t tryna kick man's leg (No)
Twelve inch Rambo, dip man's chest
Send shots tryna hit man's head
Mind your friends don’t intercept (Sho')

[Chorus: Headie One]
Bad B on the Nizz
You really think I went upsie for scrum?
Live corn in the shh
I could’ve let it in the uni room (Shh)
But I know better
Opps wanna see me get nicked with a shh
But I know better
Next day shh got-got by shh (Bow)
Gang done got down two this week, that's shh and shh
They should know better
Don’t see me in the flesh and don’t make man leak
Man do shit for the 'gram and tweet
Man rise that shh and skeet
How many: shh, shh, shh, shh? Let's see (One)
