[Verse 1]
A warning to the people
The good and the evil
This is war
To the soldier, the civilian
The martyr, the victim
This is war

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the moment of truth and the moment to lie
The moment to live and the moment to die
The moment to fight, the moment to fight
To fight, to fight, to fight

[Chorus]
To the right, to the left
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the Earth
It's a brave new world
From the last to the first
To the right, to the left
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the Earth
It's a brave new world
It's a brave new world

[Verse 2]
A warning to the prophet
The liar, the honest
This is war
To the leader, the pariah
The victor, the messiah
This is war

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the moment of truth and the moment to lie
The moment to live and the moment to die
The moment to fight, the moment to fight
To fight, to fight, to fight

[Chorus]
To the right, to the left
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the Earth
It's a brave new world
From the last to the first
To the right, to the left
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the Earth
It's a brave new world
It's a brave new world
It's a brave new world

[Bridge]
I do believe in the light
Raise your hands into the sky
The fight is done, the war is won
Lift your hands toward the sun
Toward the sun
Toward the sun (It's the moment of truth and the moment to lie
The moment to live and the moment to die)
Toward the sun (It's the moment of truth and the moment to lie
The moment to live and the moment to die)
Toward the sun (It's the moment to fight, the moment to fight
To fight, to fight, to fight)
The war is won

[Chorus]
To the right, to the left
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the Earth
It's a brave new world
From the last to the first
To the right, to the left
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the Earth
It's a brave new world
It's a brave new world
It's a brave new world

[Outro]
A brave new world
The war is won
The war is won
A brave new world
