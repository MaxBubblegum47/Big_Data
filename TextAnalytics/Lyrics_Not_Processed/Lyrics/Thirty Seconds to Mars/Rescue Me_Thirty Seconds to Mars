[Verse 1]
Whatever you do, don't ever play my game
Too many years being the king of pain
You gotta lose it all if you wanna take control
Sell yourself to save your soul

[Chorus]
Rescue me from the demons in my mind
Rescue me from the lovers in my life
Rescue me from the demons in my mind
Rescue me, rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me

[Verse 2]
Whatever you do, don't ever lose your faith
The devil's quick to love lust and fame
Better to say yes than never know, oh, oh
Sell yourself to save your soul

[Chorus]
Rescue me from the demons in my mind
Rescue me from the lovers in my life
Rescue me from the demons in my mind
Rescue me, rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me

[Bridge]
Sell yourself to save your soul, (you gotta) oh, oh
Sell yourself to save your soul, (you gotta) oh, oh
Sell yourself to save your soul, (you gotta) oh, oh
Sell yourself to save your soul

[Chorus]
Rescue me from the demons in my mind
Rescue me from the lovers in my life
Rescue me from the demons in my mind
Rescue me, rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me, oh, oh
Rescue me, oh, oh
Rescue me, oh, oh
Rescue me, rescue me, rescue me
