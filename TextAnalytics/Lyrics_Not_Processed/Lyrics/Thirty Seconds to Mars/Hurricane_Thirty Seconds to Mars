[Verse 1]
No matter how many times that you told me
You wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took
You still couldn't breathe

No matter how many nights that you'd lie wide awake
To the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go?

As the days go by, the night's on fire...

[Chorus]
Tell me, would you kill to save a life?
Tell me, would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

[Verse 2]
No matter how many deaths that I die
I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live
I will never regret

There is a fire inside of this heart
And a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God? Where is your God?
Where is your God?

Do you really want? Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want? Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to live a lie?

[Chorus]
Tell me, would you kill to save a life?
Tell me, would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

[Bridge]
The promises we made were not enough
The prayers that we had prayed were like a drug
The secrets that we sold were never known
The love we had, the love we had, we had to let it go

(Never giving in, again)
(Never giving in, again)

[Chorus]
Tell me, would you kill to save a life?
Tell me, would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

This hurricane
This hurricane
This hurricane
