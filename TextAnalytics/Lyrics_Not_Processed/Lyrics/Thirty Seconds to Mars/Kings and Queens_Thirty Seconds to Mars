[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Into the night
Desperate and broken
The sound of a fight
Father has spoken

[Chorus]
We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell
Heaven and hell

[Verse 2]
Into your eyes
Hopeless and taken
We stole our new lives
Through blood and name
In defense of our dreams
In defense of our dreams

[Chorus]
We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell
Heaven and hell

[Bridge]
The age of man is over
A darkness comes at dawn
These lessons that weâ€™ve learned here
Have only just begun

[Chorus]
We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell

[Outro]
We are the kings
We are the queens
We are the kings
We are the queens
