[Verse: Zacari]
You love it when I fall on my face
Don't act so surprised when
I'm in, oh, my rightful place
Ain't it righteous? Amen (amen)

[Chorus: Zacari]
This time around, there's time to turn it around
This time around, there's still time to turn it around
This time around, there's always time to turn it around
This time around (this time around)

[Outro: Hykeem Carter & Kendrick Lamar]
Sky keep fallin' down, fallin' down (Black Panther)
I keep fallin' down, fallin' down
I keep fallin' down, fallin' down
Sky keep fallin' down
