[Hook]
Worship like a idol
Stack my money up in piles
Money long like it’s the Nile
And I put that on my bible
And she tryna take my title
And these bitches so recycled
And I put that on my bible
Yes I put that on my bible

[Verse 1]
Lord forgive me, yes I know that I’ve sinned
I’m just tryna touch an M
Yes I’ve prayed everyday in the pen
They don’t wanna see me win
Long hair, bitches blowing in the wind
Talking all them guns but that shit is pretend
Do it by mess up nobody gon’ land
Brazy bitch I’ma say it again
Do not test your luck!
Hundred round drum, everybody fucking duck
Yeah don’t get your man, cause you know he’s star struck
He always a second and I know that shit suck
Bitch what? Lame ass hoes

[Hook]
Worship like a idol
Stack my money up in piles
Money long like it’s the Nile
And I put that on my bible
And she tryna take my title
And these bitches so recycled
And I put that on my bible
Yes I put that on my bible

[Verse 2]
I’m really going psycho you can call me Michael
And these niggas finna die though, and I put that on my bible
R-r-ran a couple milli how you feel about that shit
Pink chokers on my neck
And my diamonds really glist
I don’t really wanna talk
Don’t know why they wanna diss
If you really talking shit
I got Braelynn in the back
And she really hold that clip
And I get your ass dismissed
Ah, ah
And I get your ass dismissed

[Hook]
Worship like a idol
Stack my money up in piles
Money long like it’s the Nile
And I put that on my bible
And she tryna take my title
And these bitches so recycled
And I put that on my bible
Yes I put that on my bible
