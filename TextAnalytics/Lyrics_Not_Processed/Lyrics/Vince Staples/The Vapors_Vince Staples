[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
You've been on my mind, I've been tryna let it go
I've been tryna find somethin' as incredible
As you and I, but that's a never
No feeling can compare to you
You just gotta let me know

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Take me over...
Can I hit it again?
I'm under your control
Can I hit it again?

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
You stay on the grind, I'm always available
Rollin' in my ride, so I gotta take it slow
You got me so high, up, up and away we go
Racin' to the sky, I'm feelin' unfadable
'Cause the vapors, could save us
And take us and make us believe
That we are free (That we are free)
We can be free (We can be free)
So can I please…

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
And again and again
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
And again and again
Take me over
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
And again and again
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
And again and again
Take me over
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Please don't rain on my parade
The fallin' from the sky just remind of the days
When you was cryin' for attention
I ignored it as a phase
Until you couldn't take the tension
Now I wish you would have stayed
Walkin' through the smoke and mirrors
Burdened, you burning bridges
Memories fading faded it help you not to remember
The trials and tribulations, eyes red from cryin'
The perfect way to disguise it you was blinded by our fate
Please don't rain on my parade 'cause this float was built for you
Kinda hard to chase you down when you floatin' through the room
All you wanted was the truth and all I wanted was my way
Regardless how I word the phrase all you hear me say is...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Take me over
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?

[Outro: Jhené Aiko]
Take me over, I'm under your control
