[Intro: Vince Staples]
You are now tuned into the tomb of Jehova
Play my tunes loud enough to shake the room, what's the hold up?
Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told ya 
They tryna dinosaur us so now it's time to go up

Drop that ass 'fore it crash (

The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
The roof is on fire
, 
she wet like Barbra Streisand
Police everywhere, it's like a nigga killed a white man
I just wanna find a baby mama 'fore the night end
So don't be coming 'round Vince on that batter ram shit
On that 911 shit
, need a misses brown as Missy
I can have some fun with
, 
them slave bones make Grace Jones
Don't stop, bitch, stay focused, 
they hated on us since days of Moses
Let my people go crazy
, 
them stars falling, don't chase 'em

[Bridge: 2D]
Attack on Iraq
, 
it's on a line
Typing it fast, then it's slipping my mind
Oh, when I'm drunk, I'm spirited back
I fall in a fire then I save myself
Then I get advantage 'cause the feeling's so raw
In these times of sedition, well, nothing is dull
And I'm moving into stillness and recalling it all
And I’m a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a-

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
All these liberated women sitting in my lap
I'm finna catch a body like I got a gun and badge
I'm finna turn {Obama} to my partner 'fore he dash
Pull up to the pad, wipe my ass with the flag
I'm just playing, baby, this the land of the free
Where you can get a Glock and a gram for the cheap
Where you can live your dreams long as you don't look like me
Be a puppet on a string, hanging from a fucking tree
(Aghh!)

The sky's falling, baby
Falling, baby, falling (
