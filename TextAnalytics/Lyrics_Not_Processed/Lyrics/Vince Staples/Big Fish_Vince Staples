[Intro: Juicy J]
You can get anything you want
Know what I'm saying?
You want that over there?
You want that over there?
I got you

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
I was up late night balling
So far from my past misfortune
No sleepin', late nights no eatin'
Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian
Ramona, I was round that corner
Still down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier
G slide right down do Sawyer
When we slide, you won't see morning
Another story of a young black man
Tryna make it up out that jam, god damn
Bag back, let me make my bands, got plans
If you hatin' don't shake my hand
Take it easy, homie
Reminiscin' sitting in that Benz
Of the 22 bus stop way back when
With the 22, 5 shot eyes on scan
For the click, clack, clap
Or the boop, bop, bam, cuz

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
It's funny I was going crazy not too long ago
Women problems every morning like the Maury show
Swimming upstream while I'm tryna keep my bread
From the sharks make me wanna put the hammer to my head
At the park politickin' with the kids
Tryna get em on a straight path, got the lames mad
Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash
In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation conversations what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking
Quarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water
Mix the holy water with the Voss
Wanna be the boss then you gotta pay the cost
Learned it from the Dogg I'm from Long Beach
That's the city where the skinny carry strong heat

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousand
