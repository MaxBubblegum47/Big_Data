[Verse 1]
Hmm, if ever I get lost in your eyes tonight
Please just let me stay right there a little bit longer
Underneath the stars, we are on fire
And I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go

[Chorus]
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
I just wanna linger like this on your lips
And taste the salt air on your skin
Hold you in my hands
Anything and everything, you know that I'm all in

[Chorus]
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah
Oh, let's just stay right here tonight

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while

[Chorus]
I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, whoa
