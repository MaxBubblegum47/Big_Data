How does it feel to know
That I can't get you off my mind
Oh I can try
But you get inside my head
And that would be just fine if I knew
What I was to you

Am I forgettable
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable
Is there a chance I could be the one
Have I changed anything
Is there a place you keep for me
What have I become to you
Define me. Define me

What am I supposed to do
Im scared of reaching out to you
To have you pull away
Im not afraid of letting go
But it would sure be nice to know
The right card to play

Am I forgettable
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable
Is there a chance I could be the one
Have I changed anything
Is there a place you keep for me
What have I become to you
Define me. Define me

And I
Have waited ever patiently
And I
Have come up with a few simple things
That you
Could say to reassure me that youre mine
One last time

Am I forgettable
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable
Is there a chance I could be the one
Have I changed anything
Is there a place you keep for me
What have I become to you
Define me. Define me

Am I forgettable
Is mine the name that ties your tongue
Or am I memorable
Is there a chance I could be the one
Have I changed anything
Is there a place you keep for me
What have I become to you
Define me. Define me
