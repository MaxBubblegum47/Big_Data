[Letra de "Instagram" ft. Natti Natasha & Afro Bros]

[Verse 1: Natti Natasha]
Just bought a black Ferrari
House in the hills in L.A
Say that you'll take care of me
Sorry, but I don't need a plan like that
Don't need a man like that
What'd you say?
You say that you've been on TV?
And I should come back to your place?
Hold up, let me set you straight
School's in session, let me educate

[Chorus: Natti Natasha]
Who the hell do you think I am?
I don't give a fuck about your Instagram
Listen up, 'cause I'm not that girl
Ain't enough liquor in the whole wide world
Who the hell do you think I am?
I don't give a fuck about your Instagram
Fly away, little Peter Pan
Now you know who the fuck I am

[Post-Chorus: Natti Natasha & 
Daddy Yankee
]
Who the hell?
Who the hell?
(
Tirili Daddy, tirili Daddy
)
Little Daddy know who the fuck I am (
Ay-ay-ay
)

[Verse 2: Daddy Yankee]
Baby quien te escucha hablando te cree (Yeh)
Una mentira la puede' vender (Yeh)
Sólo yo sé que cuando tú me ve'
Cae' rápido (Oh), cae' rápido (Eh)
Conmigo sale a flote (Yeh)
Te pasa' en mi bote (Prr)
Me fui en güira contigo y en tu cancha te la anoté (Yeh)
No diga' que no, no diga' que no (Que no)
Te vieron perreando conmigo en el club (Yeh)
Porque cuando tiro soy el fran-francotirador
Que siempre te da en el blanco
Mi cuenta debita, pero soy franco
Nadie deposita má' que yo en el banco

[Bridge: Daddy Yankee]
Me da igual (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Dice' lo que te conviene, porque te viene
Me da igual (Me da igual)
Vive y aprende, si no me entiende', ¡jódete!

[Chorus: Natti Natasha, 
Natti Natasha & Daddy Yankee
]
Who the hell do you think I am?
I don't give a fuck about your Instagram
Listen up, 'cause I'm not that girl
Ain't enough liquor in the whole wide world
Who the hell do you think I am?
I don't give a fuck about your Instagram
Fly away, little Peter Pan
Now you know 
who the fuck I am

[Post-Chorus: Natti Natasha & 
Daddy Yankee
]
Who the hell?
Who the hell? (
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
)
Little Daddy know who the fuck I am (Ey)

[Bridge: Natti Natasha]
Hold up, every girl likes confidence
But did you think about the consequence? (Slow up)
You don't know me like that
Two steps forward and I'm two steps back like
Ooh, losing my patience, I try to play nice
Ooh, seems you're not listening, now I'm just like

[Chorus: Natti Natasha]
Who the hell do you think I am?
I don't give a fuck about your Instagram
Listen up, 'cause I'm not that girl
Ain't enough liquor in the whole wide world
Who the hell do you think I am?
I don't give a fuck about your Instagram
Fly away, little Peter Pan
(Now you know who the fuck I am)
