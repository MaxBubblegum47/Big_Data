Verse 1:
Woke up this morning
Chillin' on my head
Didn't wanna wake my man
So instead I called my girlies
Let's chill today
Go out and play
Get in the car and let's
Cruise around the way
While the lead track plays
In the back so soothin'
The system is pumpin'
Got the kids on the block bumpin'
Just chillin' with my girls it's somethin'
Got more funk in the trunk and it's funkin'
Me and the girls know the time before we enter
The center of my path-finder
Flirtin' with the guys
Cool with the girls
No members, just money
Or say in your world
Crusin' to the homebase
In Vegas where were livin'
Peace sign is up
When we're ridin' through
Passin', hey how you doin'
This is how we do
Cuz we keep it goin' on
Word iz bond

Chorus:
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on

Verse 2:
We be chillin' with the hottest phat funk fashion
Donna Karen, that's the gear we be wearin'
Pullin' out a list to get me back and get me fizzed
What I do, when I chill with my crew
So just to get a shot to all my peeps on the street
We dedicate this song
On and on and on
To whom we've known so long
We gotta stay strong
On and on and on
Word iz bond

(Shyheim)
I shine like diamonds
On some straight Lariems
On the Benz glidin'
Through smoke foggy wind
Lay back in the Coupe
And tellin' ya smellin' like weed
Who creeps up on the side of me
Talkin' all I need
Peep Dom P's in the bright pink and white rover
I'm pointin' to the nearest corner for shorty to pull it over
She cracked a smile, word iz bond
I almost crashin'
I blinked again and they was gone that fast
Word iz bond

Chorus:
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on

Chorus:
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on
On and on
Word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn
And it's on
On and on...
