I was a banker
Family man
Working in Paris
When I began
Living my daydreams
I left my wife
Sailed for the islands
To start a new life

Down in the tropics, a colorful world
Green of the ocean and brown native girls
Now I'm an artist and I see nothing wrong
To paint Tahitian without her sarong, oh no

You know I don't speak the language
But I still understand
It's in the move of her body
And in the touch of her hand
You know I don't speak the language

Am I a madman
To follow the sun
When it's every man's dream
To do what I've done?

Oh, no needs, no worries and no sense of time
She's Polynesian and she is all mine
Today I'll paint her in yellows and reds
Tonight we'll make love with stars overhead, oh no

You know I don't speak the language
But I still understand
It's in the move of her body
And in the touch of her hand
You know I don't speak the language

De lay lo lay lo lay lo lay lo
De lay lo lay lo la
De lay lo lay lo lay lo lay lo la

You know I don't speak the language
But I still understand
It's in the move of her body
And in the touch of her hand
You know I don't speak the language

I left the tempo
Of civilized man
To dance the tango
Utopian

Mmm, how can I leave here, how can I go back?
The life here is so aphrodisiac
Her eyes, her lips and the smell of her hair
Make me a savage and I cease to care, oh no

You know I don't speak the language
But I still understand
It's in the move of her body
And in the touch of her hand
You know I don't speak the language

De lay lo lay lo lay lo lay lo
De lay lo lay lo la
De lay lo lay lo lay lo lay lo
De lay lo lay lo la
De lay lo lay lo lay lo lay lo
De lay lo lay lo la
De lay lo lay lo lay lo lay lo
De lay lo lay lo la

De lay lo lay lo lay lo lay lo
De lay lo lay lo la
De lay lo lay lo lay lo lay lo
De lay lo lay lo la
De lay lo lay lo lay lo lay lo
De lay lo lay lo la
