[Verse 1]
Last night, I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry clean
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?
And you said

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

[Verse 2]
You're on a roll and now you pray it lasts
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast?
And she said

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

[Bridge]
(Never let another girl like you)
Work me over
(Never let another girl like you)
Drag me under
(If I meet another girl like you)
I will tell her
(Never want another girl like you)
Have to say, oh

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
(Whoa)
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving
