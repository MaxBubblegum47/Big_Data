[Intro: Young M.A]
It's Red Lyfe
It's Red Lyfe

[Verse: Young M.A]
Nobody safe anymore
Had to wake you niggas up, I couldn't wait anymore
Got so much shit on my mind, couldn't think anymore
I swear when this album drop they gon' hate me some more
You gonna see red everywhere, like a steak when it's raw
Fuck around and call me M.A Shakur, I'ma take them to war
Top of the hill, that's me waving that sword
Couldn't wait to be on, these rappers hate to be born
Speaking of birth, I just wanna thank my mother
For having me after she had my brother, all that pain and that suffer
She ain't just have us natural, the doctors they had to cut her (I love you ma)
C-section but what a blessing
Who would've guessed that the next best is, nobody expected
Me a she, nigga, accept it I'm here
I swear to god I ain't scared of these niggas
Damn, I'm must really put fear in these niggas
Because they call me a dyke, a faggot, a gay bitch
I ain't shit, that hate shit, that hatred, goddamn
That just make them look less of a man, fam
And to sit on y'all is part of the damn plan
They just mad cause I beat the pussy like Bam Bam
Because I'm making these bitches twerk on a handstand
Nobody's talking that talk, the way I talk it duke
Word to Skype, how I see it is how I call it dude
I open doors that they walking through
Not to brag but it's important to
Cause they'll forget like I ain't killed shit like an abortion true
Thought you knew it's Red Lyfe, nigga we call it red if you call it blue
And while you guys too busy bringing them foreigns through
Yeah, flexing and stunting, doing what ballers do
I leave with your bitch at the same club you brought her to
If she a cougar, I tell her to bring her daughter too
When I was broke, I never hated I just waited to flex
'Cause in my mind I already I knew I was next
Now I all I do is finesse, straight bands got a few in his TEC
Like jail calls, all I do is collect
My stress level up but this is what I do when I'm stressed
I make her go down like the sun doing the set
I hear you talking but I don't consider you as a threat
Like what's the name? You don't consider who as a threat?
Exactly, it's M.A nigga I move as a threat
They tryna knock me and it's funny cause they doing they best
Shake the haters off like a dog do when it's wet
I run down on them like a dog do when it fetch
Rollie face blue look like somebody losing they breath
It's cool, they can hate still ain't losing a check
Real niggas know what's up, I ain't losing respect
I'm like blood, I let the bars move through your flesh
The more fame, the more problems man believe me
But I ain't going nowhere nigga, they need me
I eat this hating shit for breakfast, ah they feed me
To beat me is like climbing mountains, the three peaks
Niggas mad cause my bitch bad, we throw ones on strippers
Then we watch them stuff racks in they tip bag
I used to sell O's by the zip bag
Now we smoke fronto, not no zig zags
My goons in the fields, not the internet
I hate when niggas use the internet to send a threat
FED's watching, so we ain't really into that
That's your life, you gotta live with that
When that hate don't work they start telling lies
That's real shit, that's why these haters becoming like flies
Get it, don't let these lines go over your mind
But I'ma keep shitting, on 'em I hope you don't mind
All that hating and they still ain't paid, yet
By the way, I got a 100 bands stuffed in these beige sweats
Got bags full of money, still ain't been to the bank yet
I ain't really have time to deposit these Chase checks
I used to chase checks, now that money coming
I'm talking fast, real fast like that money running
Blue dye on my hands from all that money touching
Blue dye on my pants from all that money rubbing
Damn, I got a lotta bash for that phone shit
Just the ones that think they know, but never know shit
Shawty knew I was playing just on some joke shit
Yeah, the Henny played a part we drunk the whole shit
Man, they gotta understand this is some road shit
We just be fucking around, regular show shit
I wasn't gonna say nothing was gonna hold shit
But they made it seem like I was on some hoe shit, never that
I been humble and I'm still humble
And to the ones who turned on me, man I still love you
Keyz said "bro fuck 'em they gon' still bump you"
And all these hoes that wanna fuck you, they gon' still want to
You know haters gon' dickride they gon' still suck you
And all these groupie-ass niggas they gon' still bug you
Just don't let the devil take your good spirits from you
Just pray on it, stay focused keep your vision tunneled
I love my team, I swear it's like we move in a huddle
I don't let this shit affect me, I move in a bubble
I swear my haters move in a bundle
It's like they all come together like a fucking puzzle
'Til that thing go click like a seat buckle
But I just smoke and sip the Henny 'til I'm seeing double
My money long I can't afford to even be in trouble
Accomplished so much I ain't tryna see it crumble
Been working so much that I don't even see the hustle
I just been flexing like you seen a muscle
Fighting these demons they don't see the rumble
Hold the ball, they rather see you fumble
You act so low, they rather be above you
You need a drink, naw I need a couple, I'm just being honest
I'm being real, I swear I'm being modest
I don't gotta be fly, I'm fly in my pockets
I rather invest money and triple my profit
The fliest niggas be broke and it's eating they conscience
Cause they pretend and they try to wear all these designers
You call it designer, I call it disguising
M.A speaking that knowledge, yeah I had to remind 'em
Gotta preach 'em that real, gotta teach 'em that trill
In this game is no love, either kill or be killed
I get head from your bitch and it's fuck how they feel
I ain't tryna be funny but I get dough like a deal
Give me all attention, I need all the attention
Bout to drop me a tape, collect all the commission
My goons ready for war, told 'em hold they position
They like M.A are you sure I'm ready to blow with the Smith &
But they don't understand controversy made me hot
So how the fuck think you the haters gon' make me stop
They forgot that Dr. Watkins post made me pop
I love this shit, this the shit that really made me guap
Anyway I'm done talking to 'em, back to this money
Some of y'all is a joke and I laugh cause it's funny
But I'ma go and sip this tea, yo pass me the honey
It's M.A motherfucka and I'm back on my bully
