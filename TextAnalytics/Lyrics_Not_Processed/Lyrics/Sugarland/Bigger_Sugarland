[Verse 1]
People walkin' around like the world's about to end
And if you’re asking me, my mind would agree
These days we all feel small, my friend
It’s getting harder and harder to hold our heads up high
Baby, let’s circle the wagons
Show all the dragons they don’t own the sky
We know how to fly

[Pre-Chorus]
Gravity can’t hold us down
We're moving at the speed of sound
Past the point from here on out
There’s no going back

[Chorus]
'Cause we were born for better days
We’ll find a way, yeah
We’re gonna be bigger
Don't give up, you’re more than enough
Believe me love, yeah
You’re gonna be bigger

[Verse 2]
Lookin' at everybody else
And you hate yourself
And it hurts your heart
Yeah, it’s easy to let it
Make you forget it
You are perfect the way you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Gravity can’t hold you down
You’re moving at the speed of sound
Past the point from here on out
There’s no going back

[Chorus]
'Cause we were born for better days
We’ll find a way, yeah
We’re gonna be bigger
Don't give up, you’re more than enough
Believe me love, yeah
You’re gonna be bigger

[Bridge]
If they’re uninvited, don't shut your mouth, don't keep quiet
Just let 'em know that they can't try it
That this body's your temple and they can’t buy it
'Cause nobody’s money, no 'mount of power
No kind of bait can make you take
And hate yourself for what they did
You won’t forget, you can't forgive
They think they're big, but you’re bigger

[Chorus]
'Cause we were born for better days
We’ll find a way, yeah
We’re gonna be bigger
Don't give up you’re more than enough
(Gonna be gonna be) believe me love, yeah
You're gonna be bigger
'Cause we were born for better days
We’ll find (gonna be, gonna be) a way, yeah
We’re gonna be bigger
Don't give up you’re more than enough
Believe me love, yeah
You’re gonna be bigger
Yeah, you’re gonna be bigger
