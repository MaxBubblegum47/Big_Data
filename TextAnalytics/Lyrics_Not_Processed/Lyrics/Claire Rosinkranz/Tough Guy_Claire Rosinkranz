Verse 1
I notice you when you walk into the room but
You kind of hang around and you barely make a sound but
I hope that you don't hurt me because I don't like to get hurt and baby baby
I don't wanna get caught up in all of your dirt

Chorus
Cause you're a tough guy I can tell
But you're still hiding inside your shell
I want to get you out (oowooh)
And see what you're all about
You're a tough guy I can tell
But you're still hiding inside your shell
Baby baby maybe maybe
Dadadadadadadadada

Verse 2
I notice you when you walk into the room but
You kind of stay away and I get it you like your space but
I hope that you don't hurt me because I don't like to get hurt
And baby baby
I'd like to see your face not the back of your shirt

Chorus
Cause you're a tough guy I can tell
But you're still hiding inside your shell
I want to get you out (oowooh)
And see what you're all about
You're a tough guy I can tell
But you're still hiding inside your shell
Baby baby maybe maybe
Dadadadadadadadada

(Instrumental)

Chorus
Cause you're a tough guy I can tell
But you're still hiding inside your shell
I want to get you out (oowooh)
And see what you're all about
You're a tough guy I can tell
But you're still hiding inside your shell
Baby baby maybe maybe
Dadadadadadadadada

Cause you're a tough guy I can tell
But you're still hiding inside your shell
I want to get you out (oowooh)
And see what you're all about
You're a tough guy I can tell
But you're still hiding inside your shell
Baby baby maybe maybe
Dadadadadadadadada
