Verse 1
I'm being stuck up in the muck leaning on a lot of luck
Getting in my head again
And now I'm being rude to my mom
What the hell is going on
I'm saying things that I'm gonna regret
And now I'm being self obsessed
I'm falling into stress
Yes why am I depressed well duh
Chorus
Are you being serious?
Are you really oblivious?
Are you being serious?
You've got a let time take the lead and ride
(you've gotta let time)
Verse 2
I've got my mood on attitude
Don't you tell me what to do
Chasing my tail like a dog
And now I'm breaking down by myself
Kind of worried for my health
But honestly I'm not surprised
Right now
Cause I know some things that I said
Are the reason that I'm fed up
With everyone including myself
And I don't like to say you're right
So I choose to pick a fight
Instead of simply saying sorry instead
Chorus
Are you being serious?
Are you really oblivious?
Are you being serious?
You've got a let time take the lead and ride
(you've gotta let time)
Bridge part 1
Time, time, time, time, time, time
Dadadadadada
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Bridge part 2
Lost in my head lost in my head
Living in my daydreams lost in my head
Lost in my head lost in my head again
Lost in my head lost in my head
Cotton candy clouds float around in my brain wow
Lost in my head lost in my head again
(again, again, again, again, again babadaba bow wow)
Chorus
Are you being serious
Are you really oblivious
Are you being serious
You've got a let time take the lead and ride
(you've gotta let time)
