[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love...

[Verse 1]
Look, I love it when they count me out, I'm a soldier (I'm a soldier)
Love when they think I ain't cool 'cause I'm sober ('Cause I'm sober)
You used to love when we was down, we was closer (Yeah, yeah)
But I stopped lovin' ever since I got fucked over
Ho, don't call me, I don't know ya
You gotta keep that same energy (Energy)
I'm not no regular entity (Woo)
I'm not your friend, I'm your enemy (Enemy)
I don't know what's gotten into me
Lately, I'm just feelin' finicky
Lately, I just want the cake and the greatest amenities
Lately, I ain't got no sympathy, aim at the industry
This ain't the way that they pictured me, what's your identity?
I guess I'm linin' 'em up
I keep my nine in the trunk (Bang)
All of y'all niggas gon' bleed (Bleed)
Guess it's that time of the month
I done came up from the mud
They said I'd never be nothin', they said I'd never be rich
They said I'd never be anything, I told 'em, "Get off my dick"

[Chorus]
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love...

[Verse 2]
Yo, I love days they say I couldn't eat when I fell (Yeah)
On the streets with no help (Word)
Money ain't everything (Woo)
Nigga, speak for yourself (Ayy)
Pawn shops every week (Week)
Scrapin' change, pay the bills (Yeah)
Rainy days, couldn't sleep (Word)
Now I sleep with my grills (Joyner)
I wanted to be like Hov (Woo)
I'm livin' la vida loc' (Loc')
They jus' wanna ride my wave (Woo)
You ain't never seen my boat (Splash)
Hit 'em with the Eastside smoke
I'ma kill everyone, I'm a G.I. Joe
Hidin' my weapons all in my Levi's coat
If a nigga was pimpin', you'd prolly be my ho (Woo)
I need some different opponents ('Ponents)
I think I live in the moment (Yeah)
I fuck my bitch in the mornin' (Joyner)
I take that shit when I want it (True)
All you new niggas be frontin'
You just be lyin', I keep it 300
Came up from nothin', I say what I want
And no, ain't no discussion, I aim and I bust

[Chorus]
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love (I love, I love)
