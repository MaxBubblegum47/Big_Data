[Verse 1]
There’s a notebook on the table
You can take it to the store
So you won’t forget the groceries anymore
There’s a rifle in the cabinet that I used to fight a war
But to this day, I don’t know what I was fighting for
I’m fighting for

[Chorus]
Will you show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet
After 30 years of service and the wounds of it are me
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need

[Verse 2]
There’s a blanket on the sofa that I used to keep you warm
When I find you fast asleep at half past four
There’s a record we keep turning that reminds us of our youth
But there’s still nothing as beautiful as you

[Chorus]
Will you show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet
After 30 years of service and the wounds of it are me
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need

[Bridge]
As we grow colder
Love provide the heat
Older bones are missing
Hearts will never meet
Because your hand belongs in my hand
Belongs in your hand, belongs with, with me
(Blanket on the sofa that I used to keep you warm
There’s a record we keep turning that I used to turn you on)

[Chorus]
Show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet
After 30 years of service and the wounds of it are me
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need
