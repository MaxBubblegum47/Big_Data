[Intro: T.I. & Mr. Probz]
Hustle Gang over everythin', yeah, uh huh
Drifting away
Wait, hol' up

[Verse 1: T.I.]
My paranoia gettin' worse and my anxiety high
Mind got me stayin' in the eye of the fire
Sometimes I don't know if I'ma drown or fly
Heart so big, I be down to die
For all the ones I love, too bad they don't think I really love 'em
They don't understand that there just so many of 'em
Hustle's got so many of 'em, everybody pullin' at me
Can't leave the house without everybody lookin' at me
Hm, had a dream last night
That my wife was at my wake with my son
He said, "Look at daddy"
Somethin' got me thinkin' this might be the end
But if it is you gon' wish for a G when I'm gone

[Chorus: Mr. Probz & (Chris Brown)]
Drifting away, wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
And it feels like I'm drowning, pulling against the stream
Pulling against the wave
Drifting away, wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away (Oh-oh, drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
My face above the water
And my feet can't touch the ground, touch the ground and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Every time you are not around

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Mr. Probz]
I'm slowly drifting away, drifting away, wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream, pulling against the wave (Pulling against the)

[Bridge: T.I., Mr. Probz & Chris Brown]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, whoa
This might be the end, but if it is you gon' wish for a G when I'm gone, oh, oh
Drifting away, drifting, drifting away
Drifting away, drifting, drifting away, away, away
Drifting away, drifting, drifting away, away, away
Drifting away, drifting, drifting away

[Verse 3: Mr. Probz]
I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, to find a way, I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Mr. Probz]
I'm slowly drifting away, drifting away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting, drifting away (Slowly drifting)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream, pulling against the (Pulling against the, pulling against the)
