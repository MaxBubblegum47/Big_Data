[Verse]
Nothing's ever what we expect
But they keep asking where we're going next
All we're chasing is the sunset
Got my mind on you

[PreChorus]
Doesn't matter where we are are are are
Doesn't matter where we are are are ar-are
Doesn't matter no

[Chorus]
If there's a moment where it's perfect
We'll carve our names
As the sun goes down

Hey

As the sun goes down

Hey

As the sun goes down

As the sun goes down

[PostChorus]
Doesn't matter where we are are are are
Doesn't matter where we are are are ar-are
Doesn't matter now

Surround me now
Surround me now

[Verse]
Nothing's ever what we expect
But they keep asking where we're going next
All we're chasing is the sunset
Got my mind on you

[PreChorus]
Doesn't matter where we are are are are
Doesn't matter where we are are are ar-are
Doesn't matter no

[Chorus]
If there's a moment where it's perfect
We'll carve our names
As the sun goes down

Hey

As the sun goes down

Hey

[Outro]
Surround me now
Surround me now

As the sun goes down
