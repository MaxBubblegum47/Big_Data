[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, baby!
Ooh, ooh, hey

[Verse 1]
Ah, she got cherry lips, angel eyes
She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's out to get you, danger by design
Cold-blooded vixen, she don't compromise

[Pre-Chorus]
She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
So far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, don't be surprised

[Chorus]
Got me lifted, drifted higher than the ceilin'
Oh, baby, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feelin' so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?

[Hook]
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly?

[Verse 2]
Oh, Sweet-talkin' lady, love how you entice
Sugar with just the right amount of spice
Charmin', allurin', everyone's desire
She's out to get you â€“ you can't run, you can't hide

[Pre-Chorus]
She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
I say, so far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, well, baby, don't you be surprised

[Chorus]
Got me lifted, drifted higher than the ceilin'
Oh, baby, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feelin' so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly?

[Bridge]
So fly, oh, hey
Oh, babe
Yeah, hey

[Hook]
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly?
So, sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
But you won't get me tonight

[Chorus]
Got me lifted, drifted higher than the ceilin'
Oh, baby, it's the ultimate feelin' (I couldn't feel)
You got me lifted, feelin' so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?

[Hook]
Sugar, how you get so fly? (Oh, so fly, oh, so fly)
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly? (Oh, so fly, oh, so fly)
So, sugar, sugar, how you get so fly? (Oh, so fly, oh, so fly)
Oh, sugar, how you get so fly? (Hey)
