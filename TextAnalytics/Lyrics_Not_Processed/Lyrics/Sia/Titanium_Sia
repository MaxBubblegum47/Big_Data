[Verse 1: Sia]
You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: Sia]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

[Verse 2: Sia]
Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
Talking loud, not saying much

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: Sia]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium

[Bridge: Sia]
Stone heart, machine gun
Fired at the ones who run
Stone heart, as bulletproof glass

[Chorus: Sia]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
