[Verse 1: ZAYN]
Not tryna be in there
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me, how you choose?
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?

[Interlude: ZAYN]
'Cause I wanna touch you baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins
Just me and you

[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
(baby I'm right here)

[Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here

[Post-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here

[Verse 2: ZAYN]
We were shut like a jacket
So do your zip
We will roll down the rapids
To find a way that fits
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through?
All of the windows
Inside this room?

[Interlude: ZAYN & Sia]
'Cause I wanna touch you baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins
Just me and you

[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try

[Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here

[Post-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here

[Bridge: ZAYN & Sia]
Gon, give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it
Gon, give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it
Gon, give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it
Gon, give love to your body
Gon, give love to your body~

[Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here

[Outro: ZAYN & Sia]
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
