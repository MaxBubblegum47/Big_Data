[Intro: Charli XCX]
After the afterparty we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, the neighbors might complain
(XCX, Charli!)

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
I think it's almost 4 AM but baby I'm still feelin' just fine
Ice all up in a plastic cup and I'ma keep on sippin' all night, yeah
I might've kissed a thousand lips, but maybe that's just all in my mind
Some people never understand the way we live but we're livin' life

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Uh huh, hey, uh huh, Monday to Sunday, it's never too late
So everyone say, "We don't wanna stop!"

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, the neighbors might complain
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna stay 'til mornin'
Then when the time is up, we'll do it all again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're all in love
We're all in love

[Verse 2: Charli XCX]
I'm hangin' on my best friend's couch and my clothes are all on the floor
I got glitter in my underwear like it was Studio 54, yeah
I can't remember why I love it, but I need it baby, clap, bring on the encore
Let's pour another drink, the glasses go *clink*
Yeah, we're always up for one more

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Uh huh, hey, uh huh, Monday to Sunday, it's never too late
So everyone say, "We don't wanna stop!"

[Chorus: Charli XCX & 
Lil Yachty

'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, the neighbors might complain
'Cause after the afterparty (
Afterparty

We're gonna stay 'til mornin' (
Stay 'til mornin'
)
Then when the time is up, we'll do it again (
Oh yeah, oh, Lil Boat!
)

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
The party just ended but I'm not done with you
But my folks are out of town, we got a crib with a view
Y'all come over, bring a couple friends, I keep mine with me
Shouts out to Whitney, she was so wicked
The party was so crazy, oh
The party was so crazy, oh
Tomorrow I'll be lazy
But I'll spend it with you baby

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
Monday to Sunday, doin' it our way
RiRi on replay, cheers to the weekday
We're all in, we're all in love, yeah
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
And we do it like ice cream for dinner
Bucket of liquor, we're getting sicker
Don't need Ibiza
We're all in, we're all in love, yeah
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
And we do it like
Monday to Sunday, doin' it our way
RiRi on replay, cheers to the weekday
We're all in, we're all in love, yeah
