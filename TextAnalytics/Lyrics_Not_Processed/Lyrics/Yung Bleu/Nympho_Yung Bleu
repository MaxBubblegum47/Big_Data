[Intro]
You need my love, I need your love
I need one chance, one chance to fuck
Girl it's your birthday, let's turn up
Girl it's your birthday, let's turn up

[Chorus]
I know you got a feeling, I know you feel it
(I know you feel it baby, I swear)
I want to fuck from the front to the side, I (yeah, yeah), I
I fuck on your body like a nympho
I'm on the way so send your info
Black and white diamonds, call it Jim Crow
I put your legs out the window, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Gotta clean up the house when you comin' through
See all of this money I'm runnin' through
Bet you like when I count it in front of you
Lay you down on the couch and make love to you (come here bitch)
Panoramic vision, don't be superstitious
Lickin' on your titties, stick it in your kidneys
Rough sex, let me pin you in position
Hard like a brick, I'ma call you bitch
Smacking on your ass, hand on the glass
Face on the dash, hit it from the back
You can call me dad, hands in your pants
Bands over bands, in the mood for a one night stand
Big pistol sittin' on the nightstand
You can tell hem but he might not understand
I can never let you get the upper hand
Ass jumping, poppin' like a rubber band
Swinging on your trees like a jungle man
You will never ever need another man
I need your love, I need your love

[Chorus]
I know you got a feeling, I know you feel it
(I know you feel it baby, I swear)
I want to fuck from the front to the side, I (yeah, yeah), I
I fuck on your body like a nympho
I'm on the way so send your info
Black and white diamonds, call it Jim Crow
I put your legs out the window, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
We can get freaky baby, we can get freaky
We can get freaky baby, baby don't tease me
I'm on the way to you right right now
Four in the morning, I'm laying pipe down
I just want to know what you into
Might put your car note in your rental
I see your tan line from your swimsuit
You been gone for a minute and I miss you
Big lips, ooh, I just want to kiss you
Yeah, I'll never diss you, I'll never let you stress 'bout that nigga
'Cause I got these millions and I got these figures
Gon' spend 'em on you
And I know you got a feeling baby
You fuckin' with a real nigga baby
And so be careful, just be careful, yeah

[Chorus]
I know you got a feeling, I know you feel it
(I know you feel it baby, I swear)
I want to fuck from the front to the side, I (yeah, yeah), I
I fuck on your body like a nympho
I'm on the way so send your info
Black and white diamonds, call it Jim Crow
I put your legs out the window, yeah yeah yeah yeah
