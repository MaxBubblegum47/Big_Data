[Intro]
You broke my heart, you broke my heart

[Chorus]
You broke my heart, you broke my heart, you got me rockin' solo
My money don't fold, my money don't fold, how you gon' stack this mojo
I got my new bitch jet-skiing, I done took the cake home
I don't wanna take no photo, no I don't wanna take no photo
I don't wanna have no dates
'Cause bitch you dead to me so get the fuck up out my face
Yeah, 'cause bitch you dead to me so get the fuck up out my face

[Verse 1]
I ain't finna talk rude to you
I'm just finna talk rules to you
Listen bitch, rule number one
I'm supposed to be the number one
Fuckin' off, I ain't have a clue
I was boyfriend number two
Bringing me to rule number two
Never have me lookin' like a fool
How the fuck you thinkin' that was cool?
All the fast cars and the jewels
Nigga even paid for your shoes
(real shit, real talk nigga)
But I got a new bitch, matter fact I got 'bout three new new bitches
I done learned my lesson, treat these bitches like ain't nothin'
Most these hoes be out here fuckin' different niggas like it's nothin'
Just to feel like they is something
You did me wrong, that explains why I'm heartless
(I don't give a fuck now, for real)

[Chorus]
You broke my heart, you broke my heart, you got me rockin' solo
My money don't fold, my money don't fold, how you gon' stack this mojo
I got my new bitch jet-skiing, I done took the cake home
I don't wanna take no photo, no I don't wanna take no photo
I don't wanna have no dates
'Cause bitch you dead to me so get the fuck up out my face
Yeah, 'cause bitch you dead to me so get the fuck up out my face

[Verse 2]
Why the fuck is you calling my phone?
Why the fuck you won't leave me alone?
You made your choice, yeah
And now you got the voicemail
That pussy moist, yeah, you reminiscing
I pulled up in that mean machine and I got all the bitches
I gave you top of the line, I know you miss it baby
If you could turn back the time, I wouldn't let you baby
Now you can't buy what I buy, it's too expensive baby
Now you can't buy what I buy, it's too expensive baby
I want to lick it and stick it
I can't be fuckin' with too many bitches, I gotta be choosey and picky
I'm leaving your neck with a hickey
You might be the illest, the trillest that did it
You was surprised when I told you to visit
Ain't know that I fuck with some diddy
Come take a ride through my city
You know that you good if you bang with us
We from the trenches, we get to the digits, you know that it's dangerous
That nigga you fuckin', he lame as fuck
Ah-ayy, this what I told her

[Chorus]
You broke my heart, you broke my heart, you got me rockin' solo
My money don't fold, my money don't fold, how you gon' stack this mojo
I got my new bitch jet-skiing, I done took the cake home
I don't wanna take no photo, no I don't wanna take no photo
I don't wanna have no dates
'Cause bitch you dead to me so get the fuck up out my face
Yeah, 'cause bitch you dead to me so get the fuck up out my face
