[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I just put some ice on my baby (put some ice, yeah)
Don't care none 'bout no price for my baby (for my baby)
Hundreds on hundreds, money on money
Keepin' it comin', I'm keepin' it comin'
I just put some ice on my baby
Don't care none 'bout no price for my baby
We gon' fuck all night, you drive me crazy
We gon' fuck all night, you drive me crazy

[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
Ooh, you chocolate, just how I like it, promise I won't bite it
I see you get excited when I put this tip inside it
I like the way you ride it, ice on me, it look like sirens
Just like 5-0, I got five hoes
Just like dominoes
I fucked the bitch, I put her out, I tell her vamanos
You know it's time to go
Pull up on Bourbon, I might drop the top, ooh
My bitch ain't no barbie, she a chocolate drop, ooh
Got a lot of money on me, lot of money on me
Got a couple hundreds on me, couple hundreds on me
And I just put some ice on my

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I just put some ice on my baby (put some ice, yeah)
Don't care none 'bout no price for my baby (for my baby)
Hundreds on hundreds, money on money
Keepin' it comin', I'm keepin' it comin'
I just put some ice on my baby
Don't care none 'bout no price for my baby
We gon' fuck all night, you drive me crazy
We gon' fuck all night, you drive me crazy

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
'Gressive
You model type, say what's your bottle type? applying pressure
I'm being honest with you, when I'm talk I'm not finessing
I'm looking in your face, I'm having thoughts of you undressing
Throw the combo nights, lil convo got me erected (Hard)
In the studio I let you sit on in my sessions
I got picked for movie roles, you know I can't be too careful
Gotta pay for funerals, I can't travel, not this second
Every time I hit your phone bae you know my only question
When is we gonna get together? cancel plans and it's whatever
Got a body full of tats and I can't wait to see you naked
Ice you up, I got you flexin'
On these basic hoes, you steppin'
Runnin' through it like loose change
Got a little money on cocaine

[Chorus: Yung Bleu]
I just put some ice on my baby (put some ice, yeah)
Don't care none 'bout no price for my baby (for my baby)
Hundreds on hundreds, money on money
Keepin' it comin', I'm keepin' it comin'
I just put some ice on my baby
Don't care none 'bout no price for my baby
We gon' fuck all night, you drive me crazy
We gon' fuck all night, you drive me crazy
