[Pre-Chorus: Paris]
You know the good die young
Numbing my face, I woke up to the sun
Calling my name, she want me on her tongue
I cannot stay, I know you're not the one
All to myself, yeah Im okay

[Chorus: Paris]
Last night, I was sippin' on the drank
Fucked up, and I can't feel my face
One life, man I hope that I change
Cause if I don't, then I'll never see tomorrow
Last night, I was sippin' on the drank
Fucked up, and I can't feel my face
One life, man I hope that I change
Cause if I don't, then I'll never see tomorrow

[Verse: Trevor Daniel]
I've been wasting time waiting on you
Running fast as I can,
 moving on
Overthink a night until this morning
Only
 drink all night, until its gone
Now I'm running fast as I came from you
Now I'm running fast as I came from you
Now I'm running fast as I came from you
Now I'm running fast as I came from you
And I thought that I was winning
I was wrong from the start from the beginning
Now I got a feeling
From the moment that I saw you it was ending

[Pre-Chorus: Paris]
You know the good die young
Numbing my face, I woke up to the sun
Calling my name, she want me on her tongue
I cannot stay, I know you're not the one
All to myself, yeah Im okay

[Chorus: Paris]
Last night, I was sippin' on the drank
Fucked up, and I can't feel my face
One life, man I hope that I change
Cause if I don't, then I'll never see tomorrow
Last night, I was sippin' on the drank
Fucked up, and I can't feel my face
One life, man I hope that I change
Cause if I don't, then I'll never see tomorrow
