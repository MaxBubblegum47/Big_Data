[Chorus]
I'll love you through the highs and through the lows
So you can call me whenever, about whatever
I'm here for you for the rest of forever
A lifetime with you doesn't seem that long
I'm lovesick, got an illness
If we don't make it work, positive it's gonna kill me

[Verse]
Okay, okay, okay, it's gon' be alright
No plan to vice, can divide you and I
New coupe, it fits two inside
Let's go, we can drive
Down to the water, you pullin' me in like riptide
The world stops
Baby, I'll be right there by your side
I found something I didn't believe 'til now

[Refrain]
I drink the potion she makes, this girl is magic (Magic)
First time for everything, but this shit is drastic (Drastic)
She got me diggin', got me building a casket (Casket)
I hope there's something interesting on the classic

[Chorus]
I'll love you through the highs and through the lows
So you can call me whenever, about whatever
I'm here for you for the rest of forever
A lifetime with you doesn't seem that long
I'm lovesick, got an illness
If we don't make it work, positive it's gonna kill me

[Refrain]
I drink the potion she makes, this girl is magic
First time for everything, but this shit is drastic
She got me diggin', got me building a casket
I hope there's something interesting on the classic
I drink the potion she makes, this girl is magic (Magic)
First time for everything, but this shit is drastic (Drastic)
She got me diggin', got me building a casket (Casket)
I hope there's something interesting on the classic

[Chorus]
I'll love you through the highs and through the lows
So you can call me whenever, about whatever
I'm here for you for the rest of forever
A lifetime with you doesn't seem that long
I'm lovesick, got an illness
If we don't make it work, positive it's gonna kill me
