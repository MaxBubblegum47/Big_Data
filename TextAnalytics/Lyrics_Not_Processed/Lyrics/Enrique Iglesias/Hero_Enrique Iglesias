[Intro]
Let me be your hero

[Verse 1]
Would you dance, if I asked you to dance?
Would you run, and never look back?
Would you cry, if you saw me crying?
Would you save my soul, tonight?
Would you tremble, if I touched your lips?
Would you laugh? Oh please, tell me this
Now would you die, for the one you loved?
Hold me in your arms, tonight

[Chorus]
I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

[Verse 2]
Would you swear, that you'll always be mine
Or would you lie?
Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
I don't care, you're here tonight

[Chorus]
I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh, I just wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you
Oh, yeah
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
Well, I don't care
You're here tonight

[Chorus]
I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain (Oh yeah)
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

[Outro]
I can be your hero
I can kiss away the pain
And I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
You can take my breath away
I can be your hero
