[Verse 1]
You said "I love you" to me
And I don't know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldn’t believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I’ve been feelin' about you
It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Verse 2]
Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now it’s time to close the space between the two of us

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Bridge]
Oh, baby it's time
Oh, it's time

[Chorus]
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now

[Outro]
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
