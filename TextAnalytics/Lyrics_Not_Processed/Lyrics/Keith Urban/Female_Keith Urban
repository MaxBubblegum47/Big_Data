[Verse 1]
When you hear somebody say somebody hits like a girl
How does that hit you?
Is that such a bad thing?
When you hear a song that they play sayin' you run the world
Do you believe it?
Will you live to see it?

[Chorus]
Sister, shoulder
Daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo
Mother nature
Fire, suit of armor
Soul survivor, Holy Water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor, river wild
Baby, girl, woman, child
Female

[Verse 2]
When somebody laughs and implies that she asked for it
Just cause she was wearing a skirt
Oh, is that how that works?
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first
Does that make you second best?
Or did he save the best for last?

[Chorus]
Sister, shoulder
Daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo
Mother nature
Fire, suit of armor
Soul survivor, Holy Water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor, river wild
Baby, girl, woman, child
Female

[Refrain]
Yeah
Female

[Bridge]
She's the heart of life
She's the dreamer's dream
She's the hands of time
She's the queen of kings

[Chorus]
Sister, shoulder
Daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo
Mother nature
Fire, suit of armor
Soul survivor, Holy Water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor, river wild
Baby, girl, woman, child
Female

[Outro]
Mhm
Female
