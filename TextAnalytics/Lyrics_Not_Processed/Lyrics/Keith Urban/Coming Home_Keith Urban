[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I wake up feeling, in my soul I'm
Living someone else's life
I'm turnin' into concrete, harder than these city streets
Where no one even cares if I'm alive

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
I gotta get it right, mmm
Get it right, mmm, mmm

[Chorus: Keith Urban]
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home

[Verse 2: Keith Urban]
My mind's heavy and I can't sleep, not even a memory
Is good enough to get me through the night, mmm
I'm longin' for the real thing, people who know the real me
And all the ways to love me back to life

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
Mmm, I gotta get it right, ooh, yeah
Get it right, ooh, yeah

[Chorus: Keith Urban]
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home

[Bridge: Julia Michaels and Keith Urban]
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same (Just not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same (Just not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away, but it's not the same

[Chorus: Keith Urban and Julia Michaels]
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me (Oh, baby)
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like (Hey!)
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go (Yeah!)
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home

[Outro: Keith Urban and Julia Michaels]
(Nothin' in the world)
I'm feeling lost in all the madness
(Nothin' in the world that feels like I'm)
I need somewhere to ease my mind
Coming home (Comin' home)
These sidewalks filled with different faces (Ooh-hoo)
So many places, but there's none like mine
Coming home
