[Chorus: Desiigner]
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner
He was wishin' for a burner
To kill everybody walkin'
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Fuck bitch on BET
Have her walkin', she fuckin' for BET
Wildin' for wallet
Kill everybody walkin'
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner
He was wishin' for a burner
To kill everybody walkin'
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Fuck bitch on BET
Have her walkin', she fuckin' for BET
Wildin’ for wallet
Kill everybody walkin'
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner

[Verse: Kanye West & 
Desiigner
]
Born in the nation that breeded us
Why they don't never show me the love?
Jesus Shuttlesworth, I lead the squad
Walk on water while I feed the sharks
Everybody just got made alert (
Tiimmy
)
You might get killed on your way to work
Everyone seen it in broad day
Nobody feelin' that paperwork
Nobody cared, that just made it worse
All of the talkin' just made it worse
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy, too turnt up
Grab the burner, leave the block burnt up
Now look what you made me do
Look who you made me shoot
Don't ask for help from dude
That nigga crazy too
I'm the new Steve, mixed with Ali
'Bout to get freed, I'm the new Walt
Fuck what you thought
Man fuck all of y'all
Cause Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy, too turnt up
Grab the burner, leave the block burnt up
Grab the burner, leave the block burnt up

[Chorus: Desiigner]
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner
He was wishin' for a burner
To kill everybody walkin'
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Fuck bitch on BET
Have her walkin', she fuckin' for BET
Wildin' for wallet
Kill everybody walkin'
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner
He was wishin' for a burner
To kill everybody walkin’
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Fuck bitch on BET
Have her walkin', she fuckin' for BET
Wildin’ for wallet
Kill everybody walkin'
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner
