[Intro: Desiigner]
Get out my way
Fuck nigga talk, get the fuck out my face
Chopper been loaded, the drum in our way
Drum on the K

[Verse 1: Desiigner]
I’m not letting no nigga g-get in my way
Fuck nigga talk, he get hit with the K
The chopper been loaded, the drum on the K
Thought I went crazy, but back in my way
You could get hit up, just watch what you say
Don't fuck with the 12, but got 12 in the gauge
Niggas getting hit up, bodies getting zipped up
Niggas start feelin' a couple of ways
Damian Lillard, blaze
Smoking on dope, haze
Flex on the bitch, Johnny Cage
Got infrared beam on the stage
The coco, the chronic, cocaine
Feelin’ like I’m Lil Wayne
Lot of codeine, hid it from the from the gang
Hit it, hit it, hey
Chill in the trap for the winter
Pockets full of that dead nigga
Niggas be talking that wigga
I'ma keep stackin' my jigga
Lot of killers in the West
Young nigga tryna get up
Pick up, fall, get up
Pussy, fall get up
And I got bad bitch, she with me
Twisting my weed and she rolling my swisher
I got her mom in the kitchen
Bout to go in the back room with her sister
I’m the man, I’m the nigga
Niggas didn't know I’m that nigga
Some niggas not them real niggas
Got to watch out for them niggas

[Chorus: Desiigner]
Zombiie walk, no control
Lotta chopper, let it blow
Zombiie walk, no control, let it blow
Lotta chopper, no control, zombiie walk
Zombiie walk, no control
Lotta chopper, let it blow
Zombiie walk, no control, let it blow
Lotta chopper, no control, zombiie walk

[Verse 2: King Savage]
I’m just smoking on dope and it's fucking my brains
I’m sipping on Henny, it got me enraged
I’m riding ‘round town in them Rari’s and Range
Your bitch on my dick and she giving me play
Savage nigga, like to play with them things
He got a big missile, and he aiming for brains
I don’t trust niggas, all them niggas fugazi
I don’t shop on a budget, I’m just getting the cake
My niggas fucked up the cake
They do anything, they switching them lanes
I stay with Scottie Pippen
Leave your body limpin’ when I find that you fucked with the Jakes
Pass me the K, bullets put face on the pave
Chopper put niggas in graves
Bullets put face on the pave
Chopper put niggas in graves
I’m sipping on Actavis
I call that doctor-drink
Nick Cannon, got the drum
I think that that the beat
I keep that thing on me
No you can’t hang with me
The chopper go bang with me
Them niggas can’t hang with me

[Chorus: Desiigner]
Zombiie walk, no control
Lotta chopper, let it blow
Zombiie walk, no control, let it blow
Lotta chopper, no control, zombiie walk
Zombiie walk, no control
Lotta chopper, let it blow
Zombiie walk, no control, let it blow
Lotta chopper, no control, zombiie walk
