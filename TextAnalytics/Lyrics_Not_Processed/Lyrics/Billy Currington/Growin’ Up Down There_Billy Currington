[Verse 1]
That red Georgia clay when mixed with the rain
Sure made for one nasty mess
Ah, but we were riding high in the old truck of mine
In deep as we could get
Always looking for a rut, trying not to get stuck
And swinging that mud everywhere, growing up down there
Me and my friends where the deep river bends
Had a long rope tied to a tree
Taking turns on a swing, taking turns taking drinks
And I don't mean iced tea
A good buzz later playing chicken with the gators
Way too young to be scared, growing up down there

[Chorus]
And those tan little peaches turning us on
Keeping things hot all summer long
If I could back in a second I swear
Well, I'd still be growing up down there

[Verse 2]
Well, nothing going on ever lasted too long
We were good at making good times
Find a field spread the word keep a bonfire burning
Through both ends of the night
Had the radio up, had a keg in a truck
Trying to get lucky somewhere
Growing up down there

[Chorus]
And those tan little peaches turning us on
Keeping things hot all summer long
If I could back in a second I swear
Well, I'd still be growing up down there

And those tan little peaches turning us on
Keeping things hot all summer long
If I could back in a second I swear
Well, I'd still be growing up down there

[Outro]
Yeah, looking back now man it don't seem fair
If you didn't get to do your growing up down there
