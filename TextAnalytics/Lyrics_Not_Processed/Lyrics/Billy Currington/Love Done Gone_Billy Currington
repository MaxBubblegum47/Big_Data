[Verse 1]
Don't worry, baby, sometimes things change
Nothing we can do about it now, no way
This doesn't come easy, but that's just life
We can't keep pretending everything's alright
We told each other it was love before
The simple truth is it just ain't no more
The bells stop ringing, the music won't play
The crazy little feeling that's faded away
Like snowflakes when the weather warms up
Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
All the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne
Like a red kite lost in a blue sky wind
I don't know where the good times end when

[Chorus]
It ain't nothing we ever said or ever did wrong
It's just love done gone

[Verse 2]
I don't regret a single thing that we did
Anytime together, we ever spent
I wouldn't change a thing, baby, you know
Sometimes we got to just go with the flow
Like snowflakes when the weather warms up
Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
All the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne
Like money in a slot machine
Don't know what happened to you and me

[Chorus]
It ain't nothing we ever said or ever did wrong
It's just love done gone
