[Verse 1-Billy Currington]
Hey girl, what's your name girl
I've been looking at you
And every guy here's doing the same girl
It'd be a shame girl
If I let you just walk on by
Cause I'm all caught up in your sweet smile
A girl like you comes around once in a while
So hot, got to give it a shot
Gotta get get a little bit of what you got

[Chorus 1-Billy Currington]
I know you don't know me but I can't leave here lonely
Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl but who could blame me
You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is

[Verse 2-Billy Currington]
Hey girl, what you think girl
You look a little thirsty let me go get you something to drink girl
Before you blink girl
I'll be right back by your side
And if you want we can roll out
I know my way around this town
I got a shotgun seat for you
You can tell me where it is you want to take off to

[Chorus 1-Billy Currington]
I know you don't know me but I can't leave here lonely
Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl but who could blame me
You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is

[Bridge-Billy Currington]
Ooh, baby you're still standing here
I guess you must like what you hear
Hey girl, what you say girl
About you and me getting away girl

[Chorus 1-Billy Currington]
I know you don't know me but I can't leave here lonely
Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl but who could blame me
You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is

[Outro-Billy Currington]
You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied
And the only line I can think to say is
Hey girl
Oh yeah
