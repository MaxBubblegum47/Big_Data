[Verse 1]
Daily grind is stealing me away again
When I just wanna lay back down
Another night gone and don't know where it went
What I need more than anything right now

[Chorus]
Is time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you

[Verse 2]
Seven days you and me in paradise
The world revolving around us
We'd still be there and forever if the choice was mine
Cause seven days that's not enough

[Chorus]
Is time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you

[Bridge]
I'm gone for now to do the things I have to do
But baby you know I live

[Chorus]
Is time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
