I got a little change in my pocket goin' jing-a-ling-a-ling
I wanna call you on the telephone baby give you a ring
But each time we talk I get the same old thing
Always no huggie and no kissie 'til I get a weddin' ring
My honey my baby don't put my love up on no shelf
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself
Baby baby baby why you treat me this way
You know I'm still your loverboy I still feel the same way
That's when she told me the story about free milk and a cow
She said no huggie and no kissie 'til I get a weddin' vow
My honey my baby don't put my love up on no shelf
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself
See I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
That's when she started talkin 'bout true love started talkin' bout sin
I said honey I'll live with ya for the rest of my life
She said no huggie and no kissie 'til you make me your wife
My honey my baby don't put my love up on no shelf
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself
