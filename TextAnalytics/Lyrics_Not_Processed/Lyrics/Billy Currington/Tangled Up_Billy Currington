[Verse 1]
Touch me
Tell me what you want me to do
I want
To take a little trip around you
You set me on fire
Oh you set me on fire

[Chorus 1]
Light me up inside of this room
I just want to be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby I want you so much
I want to feel your breath on my skin
Find that place we've never been
I want to spend all night
Tangled up
In your love

[Verse 2]
Kiss me
Kiss me till the sun comes up
Slow, sweet
I can never get enough of your love
You are taking me higher
Oh you are taking me higher

[Chorus 1]
Light me up inside of this room
I just want to be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby I want you so much
I want to feel your breath on my skin
Find that place we've never been
I want to spend all night
Tangled up
In your love

[Chorus 1]
Light me up inside of this room
I just want to be close to you
I can't take it anymore
Baby I want you so much
I want to feel your breath on my skin
Find that place we've never been
I want to spend all night
Tangled up
In your love

[Outro]
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your bed
Tangled up in your sheets
Tangled up in your head
Tangled up in your love
Tangled up in your love
Yeah
