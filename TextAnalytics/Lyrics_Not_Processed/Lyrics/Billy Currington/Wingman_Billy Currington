[Verse 1]
Alright bro
We're gonna have a talk about this
I brought you in this club and you done stole my girl
And that ain't right

When we walked into the club I thought it was understood, mmm, hmm
It was my turn tonight and it was your job to make me look good
Then I pointed out that sweet little beauty in black, yes I did
I sent you over with a couple of drinks and you never came back

[Chorus]
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade, and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go telling me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home

[Verse 2]
Shortly after you left, I was cussing your name, hell I was
When her ugly girlfriend comes over starts working her game, mmm
And I couldn't scare her off no matter what I'd said, nah, no
I was thinking I'm the one that should be kissing on that cutie instead

[Chorus]
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade, and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go telling me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home

[Verse 3]
Whoa
They say, all is fair in love and war
And all in time I'm going to settle that score
It ain't win or lose, it's how you play the game
If I was in your shoes, I might've done it just the same

[Chorus]
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade, and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go telling me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home

[Outro]
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing man it should've been me
That's taking her home
Is taking her home, ohh
You were supposed to be my wingman, mmm, mmm
