[Verse 1]
I couldn't tell ya what I did today
Or the day before
I couldn't tell ya what song just played
Or the guys name that lives next door
Hundred dollar bills could be falling from the sky
Wouldn't even notice
But baby, I'm in tune with everything you do
I'm completely focused on

[Chorus]
Every 5'7", 3/8 inches of you, baby
How the salt in the air makes your hair kinda wavy
How you're tongue-tied when you mix wine
With the Gemini, baby, I memorized
Every brown sugar freckle that the Lord put on ya
How you lean to left, 45 degrees, right before
You're gonna kiss me
If you can't tell
I've been paying close attention to your details
Details
I've been paying close attention to your

[Verse 2]
Iced mocha latte, one shot espresso
That you stir with your left hand
Sleep with two pillows, DVR Kimmel
'Cause your eyes get heavy and
Start talking in your sleep
Fighting with somebody
You don't think you do
But trust me girl, I've studied

[Chorus]
Every 5'7", 3/8 inches of you baby
How the salt in the air makes your hair kinda wavy
How you're tongue-tied when you mix wine
With the Gemini, baby, I memorized
Every brown sugar freckle that the Lord put on ya
How you lean to left, 45 degrees, right before
You're gonna kiss me
If you can't tell
I've been paying close attention to your details
Details
I've been paying close attention to your details (Oh yeah)

[Bridge]
Hundred dollar bills could be falling from the sky
I wouldn't even notice
But baby, I'm in tune with everything you do
I'm completely focused

[Chorus]
Every 5'7", 3/8 inches of you, baby
How the salt in the air makes your hair kinda wavy
How you're tongue-tied when you mix wine
With the Gemini, baby, I memorized
Every brown sugar freckle that the Lord put on ya
How you lean to left, 45 degrees, right before
You're gonna kiss me
If you can't tell
I've been paying close attention to your details
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I've been paying close attention to your detail, your details
Yeah, oh-oh
