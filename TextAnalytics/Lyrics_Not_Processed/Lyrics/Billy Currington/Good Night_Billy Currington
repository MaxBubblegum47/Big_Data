[Verse 1]
It's a bad night
To go downtown
Amateur night
Too many tourists around
It's a bad night
To go for a drive
Speed traps
Don't wanna get a DUI
It can just be you and I
Kicking our shoes off
Listening to some Clapton yeah

[Chorus]
It's a good night
For falling in love
It's the right time for sipping
A little bit of whiskey
And it's a good night
For slowing it down
Throw some wood on the fire
Let the flame burn higher, yeah

[Verse 2]
It's the perfect night
For dancing in the kitchen
If you're hungry
We'll make a little breakfast
For dinner
It's just about to get good
You don't wanna leave now
(Come over)
Come a little closer
Let me show you how

[Chorus]
It's a good night
For falling in love
It's the right time for sipping
A little bit of whiskey
It's a good night
For slowing it down
Throw some wood on the fire
Let the flame burn higher

[Bridge]
It's a bad night
(It's a bad night)
For breaking hearts
(For breaking hearts)
You gonna break mine
If you leave me alone
In the dark

[Chorus]
But it's a good night
For falling in love
It's the right time for sipping
A little bit of whiskey
It's a good night
For slowing it down
Throw some wood on the fire
Let the flame burn
It's a good night
For falling in love
It's the right time for sipping
A little bit of whiskey
And it's a good night
For slowing it down
Throw some wood on the fire
Let the flame burn higher, yeah

[Outro]
(It's a good night baby)
(For falling in love)
Yeah, it's a good night
For falling in love
Ooo-woah-woah-woah
