[Verse 1]
I don't know what you're doing, but baby I just had to find out
Maybe it's too soon to call you, but it's too late now
I've been thinking about the way you move
And the way you look when I look at you
And I just can't wait, tomorrow's too late

[Chorus]
Baby just come over, we should be a little closer tonight
Let's drink a little something and do a lot of nothing all night
We can take it slow or we can go wherever you're feeling like
It really doesn't matter as long as we get closer tonight

[Verse 2]
You can be here in a song, I'll meet you at the end of the street
All we gotta lose is a lonely city night and some sleep
And if you got to go, I'll walk you home
Or if you don't want to wake up alone
Come on, come on, don't wait too long

[Chorus]
Baby just come over, we should be a little closer tonight
Let's drink a little something and do a lot of nothing all night
We can take it slow or we can go wherever you're feeling like
It really doesn't matter as long as we get closer tonight

[Verse 3]
Closer tonight
Don't think about it too much
Just get in the car
You're too far away
If you're anywhere but in my arms, uh, huh

[Chorus]
Baby just come over, we should be a little closer tonight
Let's drink a little something and do a lot of nothing all night
We can take it slow or we can go wherever you're feeling like
It really doesn't matter as long as we get closer tonight

[Outro]
Closer tonight, oh, oh
