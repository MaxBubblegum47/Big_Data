[Verse 1]
A tidal wave
Yeah, you crashed in here just like one and I gotta say
This bar light, neon blue, don't do you justice, babe
It’s clearer than that water when you look my way
You're on 30A

[Chorus]
I can see you seaside, runnin' ’round with a Rum Runner
Hair down, wearin' nothin' but the summer
I can see that sunshine layin' its tan on you
I can see the moonlight, like a spotlight down on ya
Salt Life, baby, that's the way I want ya
Waist deep in the ocean, while I soak in all that view
Seaside
I want you seaside

[Verse 2]
I can see ya, boardwalk, bare feet
Shore line, honey in a two-piece, sippin' somethin' sweet
I ain't tryin’ to come off wrong, but your body would look better with a beach on it
Sand so soft you can sleep on it, I kinda see me on it

[Chorus]
I can see you seaside, runnin’ 'round with a Rum Runner
Hair down, wearin’ nothin' but the summer
I can see that sunshine layin' its tan on you
I can see the moonlight, like a spotlight down on ya
Salt Life, baby, that's the way I want ya
Waist deep in the ocean, while I soak in all that view
Seaside
I want you seaside

[Bridge]
You’re a wild child, and your sun body's risin' up out the ocean
If you're feelin' what I'm feelin', let's keep this wave in motion
I can see you seaside, Rum Runner
Hair down, the summer

[Chorus]
I can see you seaside, runnin' 'round with a Rum Runner
Hair down, wearin' nothin' but the summer
I can see that sunshine layin' its tan on you
I can see the moonlight, like a spotlight down on ya
Salt Life, baby, that's the way I want ya
Waist deep in the ocean, while I soak in all that view
(Soak in all that view)

[Outro]
(I want you, I want you)
Seaside (Seaside)
(I want you, I want you)
Seaside
(I want you, I want you) Seaside
Seaside
(I want you, I want you)
Seaside
