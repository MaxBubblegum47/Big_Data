[Verse 1]
Summer coming through a rolled down window
Tearing down an almost two lane back road
Freedom and fireflies in the air

The night's still young, never going to get old
Living for today like there's no tomorrow
Follow the grooves, the tires in the grass
Staying on the gas like we're never coming back

[Chorus]
It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

[Verse 2]
Swaying back-n-forth, can't you feel the music?
Time stands still, I don't want to lose it
Her tan, her touch, her laugh
Were flying so high like we're never gonna crash

[Chorus]
It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

[Verse 3]
We are tonight, we are tonight
Toes in the grass with our hands up high
Dream as big as the midnight sky
So untamed and we're so alive tonight

[Chorus]
It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

[Outro]
We are tonight
Everything we want to be, yeah
We are, we are, we are tonight
Yeah
We are tonight
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
