[Verse 1]
I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking, "This is where rednecks come from"
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions, and I was the man for the job

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Verse 2]
I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat, and thought, you fool, it could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Bridge]
Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me?
Or am I really seeing what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams coming back to me

[Chorus]
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

[Outro]
Thank God for good directions, and turnip greens
