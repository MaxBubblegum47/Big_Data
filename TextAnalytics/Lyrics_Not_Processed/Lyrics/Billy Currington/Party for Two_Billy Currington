[Intro: Shania Twain & Billy Currington]
Hey Billy
Yeah?
I'm havin' a party, wanna come?
Nah, I don't think so, baby
Oh, come on
It's gonna be lots of fun
Nah (Woo!)
Ooh, ooh
Oh, baby

[Verse 1: Shania Twain & (Billy Currington)]
I'm having me a party (I don't think I can come)
Uh-uh, this ain't just any kind of party (Nah, I think I'll stay at home)
Uh, oh, no
It's gonna to be really, really hot (Starting to sound good)
I'm gonna put you on the spot (Baby, maybe I should)
Yeah, there'll be lots of one on one (Guess I could be there)
Come on and join the fun (What should I wear?)

[Bridge: Shania Twain & (Billy Currington)]
I'll tell you that it
It doesn't matter (Aw yeah) what you wear
'Cause it's only gonna be
You and me there (Woo!)

[Chorus: Shania Twain & Billy Currington]
I'm having a party
A party for two
Inviting nobody
Nobody but you

[Verse 2: Shania Twain & (Billy Currington)]
You'll be sexy in your socks (We could polish the floors)
Incase that anybody knocks (Let's lock all the doors)
Yeah, all the things I'm gonna do (I'm gonna do with you)
I wanna try something new (I wanna try that, too)

[Bridge: Billy Currington & Shania Twain]
I tell you that it
It doesn't matter (Uh-uh) what I wear
'Cause it's only gonna be
You and me there (Woo!)

[Chorus: Shania Twain & Billy Currington, (Billy Currington)]
I'm having a party
A party for two (Aww yeah)
Inviting nobody
Nobody but you

[Verse 3: Shania Twain & (Billy Currington), Both]
Yeah you
(I'm here) You're there
(That's all) we really need
(We're gonna) We're gonna party hearty
(Just) Just you and me
(Don't) Don't think about it now
(Don't) Don't even doubt it now
(I'm inviting you to a) party for two (Woo!)

[Break: Shania Twain & (Billy Currington)]
Shake it, shake it (Come on, baby!)
All the things I'm gonna do (I'm gonna do with you)
I'm gonna try something new with you, boy (I wanna try that, too)

[Bridge: Shania Twain & Billy Currington, Both]
I'll tell you that it
It doesn't matter what you wear
'Cause it's only gonna be
It's only gonna be you and me (Awww, yeah)

[Chorus: Kevin Churko, Shania Twain & (Billy Currington)]
I'm havin' a party (A little bitty party, baby)
A party for two
It's just me and you (That's right)
Inviting nobody
I ain’t inviting anybody (Nobody, baby)
Nobody but you

[Chorus: Shania Twain & (Billy Currington)]
I'm havin' a party (I'm havin' a party)
A party for two (A party for two)
I ain't inviting nobody (I ain't inviting nobody)
Nobody but you (Nobody but you)

[Outro: Shania Twain & (Billy Currington)]
Come on, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on, come on (Come on, come on, yeah)
Come on, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on, Come on (Come on, come on, yeah)
