[Verse 1]
I only slept for a couple of hours
In the back of my buddy's truck
I must be running on solar power
Cause I'm ready to crank back up

[Chorus]
And the boys are all banging on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rocking their bikini tops
And that big ball's way up in the sky
My baby says "Hey I think I want to get wet"
So we hots and hop into the waters' edge
Hey, it's so good to be alive
Swimming in sunshine
Swimming in sunshine

[Verse 2]
There's a hole in my beach towel
There's a hole in the atmosphere
But we got the shade of the lifeguard tower
Yeah, that's where we keep the beer

[Chorus]
And the boys are all banging on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rocking their bikini tops
And that big ball's way up in the sky
My baby says "Hey I think I want to get wet"
So we hots and hop into the waters' edge
Hey, it's so good to be alive
Swimming in sunshine
Swimming in sunshine

[Bridge]
Yeah I know Monday always comes again
So I just want to soak it in

[Chorus]
And the boys are all banging on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rocking their bikini tops
And that big ball's way up in the sky
My baby says "Hey I think I want to get wet"
So we hots and hop into the waters' edge
Hey, it's so good to be alive
Swimming in sunshine
Swimming in sunshine

[Outro]
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da da da
Swimming in sunshine
