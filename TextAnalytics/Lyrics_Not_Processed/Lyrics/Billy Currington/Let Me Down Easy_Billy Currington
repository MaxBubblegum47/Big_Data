[Verse 1]
There's a little moonlight, dancing on the sand
There's a warm breeze blowing by the ocean as you're taking my hand
You need to know where I'm standing now
That I'm right on the edge of giving in to ya
Baby it's a long way down

[Chorus]
If I fall, can ya let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're going to treat it right?
I'm barely hanging on
If I fall, can you let me down easy?

[Verse 2]
The scent of your perfume, floating in the air
Looking like an angel, lying on a blanket with a halo of hair
And those lips, look to good to be true
Once I taste that kiss, I know what'll happen
I'll be at the mercy of you

[Chorus]
If I fall, can ya let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're going to treat it right?
I'm barely hanging on
If I fall, can you let me down easy?

If I fall, can ya let me down easy?
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will you promise me that you're going to treat it right?
I'm barely hanging on
If I fall, can you let me down easy?

[Outro]
Let me down easy babe
Mmmm
