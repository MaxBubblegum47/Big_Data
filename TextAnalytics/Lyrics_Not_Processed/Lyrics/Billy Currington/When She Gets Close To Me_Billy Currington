[Verse 1]
Like a summer breeze floating across the water
Softer than a whisper on my skin
I can't begin to tell you how it moves me
It's so intense I burn within

[Chorus]
When she gets close to me my emotions break free
And I just want to hold on to her permanently
It's like nothing else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelievably heavenly
When she gets close to me

[Verse 2]
She walks across the room just like an angel
And I get that funny feeling deep inside
Pulls up a chair and sits down at the table
I come to laugh whoa there's nothing like

[Chorus]
When she gets close to me my emotions break free
And I just want to hold on to her permanently
It's like nothing else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelievably heavenly
When she gets close to me

[Verse 3]
Wow no one has ever touched me like this
Set me on fire with just one sweet gentle kiss
Amazing that's what it is

[Chorus]
When she gets close to me my emotions break free
And I just want to hold on to her permanently
It's like nothing else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelievably heavenly
When she gets close to me
