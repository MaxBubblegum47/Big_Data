[Verse 1]
You're a modern day miracle
Anything but a typical girl
Mona Lisa on a sidewalk stand
Superstar in a common man world
Nothing's been so beautiful

[Chorus]
Want to stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shot to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on

[Verse 2]
I know I've seen you somewhere before
In my mind behind door number 3
You're a pray you're a gift from god
But there's a bridge I cannot cross
It seems your distant dream
I will never hold you

[Chorus]
Want to stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shot to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on

[Bridge]
I put one foot in front of another
I walk on
Knowing there will never be another

[Chorus]
Want to stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shot to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on
