[Verse 1]
God is great
Man is not
Man made whiskey
God made pot
God made women
We make war
But oh a good woman
That's worth fighting for
Oh, yea
And the way I'm feeling
Ain't never gonna change
Baby don't you know my heart is healing
Every time I see your face

[Chorus]
La, da, da, da, da, da, dee
Oh, God made you and God made me
He made you a girl to pull me through
And he made this man for loving you
Hallelujah, so glad I bumped into ya
Hallelujah, so glad I bumped into ya

[Verse 2]
God made grandma
She made pie
Taste so good
Bring a tear to your eye
Make a grown man cry
God made music
God made love
And he made Smokey Robinson
So, let's put him on and make some, that's right
Yeah
Hallelujah

[Chorus]
La, da, da, da, da, da, dee
Oh, God made you and God made me
He made you a girl to pull me through
And he made this man for loving you
Hallelujah, so glad I bumped into ya
Hallelujah, so glad I bumped into ya

[Bridge]
I don't want no tie
I want no suit
Just want you in your birthday suit
Don't want no cars
Want no trucks
Just want you
And I want your love, oh, yeah, baby
Just want you
And I want your love

[Chorus]
La, da, da, da, da, da, dee
Oh, God made you and God made me
He made you a girl to pull me through
And he made this man for loving you
Hallelujah, so glad I bumped into ya
Hallelujah, so glad I bumped into ya
