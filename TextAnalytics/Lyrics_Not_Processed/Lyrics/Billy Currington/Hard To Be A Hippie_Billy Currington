[Verse 1]
It used to be that
You could up and thumb a ride from Nashville to L.A
And everyone who stopped and picked you up
Would get you high along the way
And it used to be that
You could fall in and out of love in an afternoon
And then fall again that evening
And not think that it was happening too soon

[Chorus]
But it's hard to be a hippie anymore
It hurts more now
Waking up on the floor
Oh, it's still free
But it ain't easy like before
It's hard to be a hippie anymore

[Verse 2]
Fire it up boys
It used to be just walking down the street
Would make the people stop and stare
Now all the cowboys and the preppies
And the rednecks and the yuppies have long hair
But I was always going places
In my head and seeing things that blew my mind
Now the only thing I'm tripping on
Are my own two feet, trying to keep up with the times
Ah yeah, you know that's right

[Chorus]
But it's hard to be a hippie anymore
It hurts more now
Waking up on the floor
Oh, it's still free
But it ain't easy like before
It's hard to be a hippie anymore

[Outro]
Lord, it's still free
But it ain't easy like before
It's hard to be a hippie anymore
