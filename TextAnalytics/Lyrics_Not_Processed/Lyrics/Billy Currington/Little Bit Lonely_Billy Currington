[Verse 1]
Well, I parked my car in the driveway
Somewhere around one am
Worn out from the road with a big heavy load
On my mind, what a week it had been
Then I stumbled into the kitchen
And I saw that little red light
Blinking at me from my message machine
Then I knew it would be alright
Because she said

[Chorus]
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely

[Verse 2]
Now it didn't take me a second til I knew
The right thing to do
I picked up the phone and said Baby I'm home
I'll be there in a minute or two
I stole some of my neighbor's daisies
Grabbed an old bottle of wine
She don't call me much but I know when she does
That I'm in for one helluva time
When she says

[Chorus]
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely

[Verse 3]
Yeah everybody needs a little love sometimes
Yeah, who am I to leave you hanging high and dry
No baby, not tonight
No,no,no,no
Not tonight, now baby

[Chorus]
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely

[Outro]
So come on baby
Said, I'll be there in a minute or two
And I brought those daises and that red wine
We had one hell of a time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
