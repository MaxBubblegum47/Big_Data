[Verse 1]
It's a gentle touch, but more than enough
She can stop this ole world from spinning too much
It's a natural thing and I do believe
I found my reason to be

[Chorus]
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me

[Verse 2]
I'm not the same man since she's been around
There's more to this life, I've suddenly found
I look at myself now so differently
It's her love that brings me peace

[Chorus]
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me

[Verse 3]
Whatever it is, I'll always be under her spell
She'll always be all I'll ever need
I could search the whole world
And I know I'd never find
Someone perfect as her for me
Suddenly it's something
You just can't live without
Oh, you know you found love
Beyond any doubt
With a simple man's words
I can never convey all that I feel when I say

[Chorus]
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me
