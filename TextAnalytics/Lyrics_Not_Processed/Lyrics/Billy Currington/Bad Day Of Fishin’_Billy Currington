[Verse]
Got up at dawn just to be out on the water
Weather man said hot and getting hotter
But he didn't say nothing bout it raining like hell (oh well)
A bad day of fishing beats a good day of anything else
Had a big one on and man I would a got them
But he took my pole straight down to the bottom
Leaving me with nothing, but a big ole story to tell (oh well)
A bad day of fishing beats a good day of anything else

[Chorus 1]
We should proly go to work, I mean everybody does
Instead of sitting out here in the middle of nowhere working on a pretty good buzz

[Chorus 2]
Didn't catch a damn thing, guess you could say we took a licking
Tonights fish fry is going to taste like chicken
But we did just fine, if I do say so myself
A bad day of fishing beats a good day of anything else

[Chorus 1]
We should proly go to work, I mean everybody does
Instead of sitting out here in the middle of nowhere working on a pretty good buzz

[Chorus 2]
Didn't catch a damn thing, guess you could say we took a licking
Tonights fish fry is going to taste like chicken
But we did just fine, if I do say so myself
A bad day of fishing beats a good day of anything else
