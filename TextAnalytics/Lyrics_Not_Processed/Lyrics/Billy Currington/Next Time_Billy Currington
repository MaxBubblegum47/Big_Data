[Verse 1]
So there's somewhere you got to be
Well, I sure hate to see you leave
I'll break my grip but babe you need to know
Next time I might not let you go

[Chorus]
I know what you said
And I wanted that too
But taking it slow is getting harder to do
It's feeling more and more like forever
Holding you close
And next time I might not let you go

[Verse 2]
Good thing I don't get paid to think
Cause I sure thought I had the strength
To fight love off, but my resistance is running low
And next time I might not let you go

[Chorus]
I know what you said
And I wanted that too
But taking it slow is getting harder to do
It's feeling more and more like forever
Holding you close
And next time I might not let you go

[Verse 3]
Yeah next time I just might
Hold on for dear life
Yeah, next time I might not let you go
Next time I might not let you go

[Outro]
So, there's somewhere you got to be
Well, I sure hate to see you leave
