[Verse 1]
She don't cook, she don't clean
She ain't never found the knob on the washing machine
She don't iron, she don't sew
Says why waste time, folding clothes
She ain't never gonna get Mama's recipe right
But she knows what to do with a Saturday night

[Chorus]
Hit every hot spot all around town
Turn it on up, she'll tear it on down
People rubber necking, trying to see her dance
She got a belly button ring and some low-rider pants
They call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night

[Verse 2]
She makes a mean margarita and a Singapore Sling
And if ya'll are into Skynard, she sure can sing
She's gonna run the table, if you let her break
She might pop out of the top of a birthday cake
And that little black dress painted on tight
She knows what to do with a Saturday night

[Chorus]
Hit every hot spot all around town
Turn it on up, she'll tear it on down
People rubber necking, trying to see her dance
She got a belly button ring and some low-rider pants
They call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night

[Verse 3]
We get home in the early a.m
That's when all the real fun begins
Yeah, she holds me close and whispers in my ear
Every little sweet thing I want to hear
Then she lights them candles and out go the lights
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
Yeah, they call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
Saturday night
With a Saturday night
Saturday night
