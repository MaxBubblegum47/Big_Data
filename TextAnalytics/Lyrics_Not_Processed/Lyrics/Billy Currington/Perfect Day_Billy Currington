[Verse 1]
Baby drop what your doing
Let's jump off this merry-go-round
I don't know if we're coming or going
Same old same old bringing me down
I've had it up to here with this rat race
We're just wasting time not tasting life

[Chorus 1]
I'd rather be sitting on the beach
Watching the sun come up
Running my finger's through your hair
As you lay there, all curled up
Looking at me with that give me one more kiss
Love doesn't get any better than this look on your face

[Chorus 2]
I'd reach down and pull you up and we'd head that sailboat out to sea
Chart our course for
Anywhere the wind blows anyplace we see
Our sails anchoring down
Loving the night away
Waiting on the light of another perfect day

[Verse 2]
I want a little sand between my toes
The sunshine on your face
But today's the perfect day

[Chorus 1]
I'd rather be sitting on the beach
Watching the sun come up
Running my finger's through your hair
As you lay there, all curled up
Looking at me with that give me one more kiss
Love doesn't get any better than this look on your face

[Chorus 2]
I'd reach down and pull you up and we'd head that sailboat out to sea
Chart our course for
Anywhere the wind blows anyplace we see
Our sails anchoring down
Loving the night away
Waiting on the light of another perfect day

[Outro]
Loving the night away
Waiting on the light of another perfect day
