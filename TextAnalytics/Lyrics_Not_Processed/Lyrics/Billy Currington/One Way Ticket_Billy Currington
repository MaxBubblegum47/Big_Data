[Verse 1]
I'm a son-of-a-gun and a dad-gum joker
I'm just a crazy, old laid-back loafer
I got a dog looks like a gopher
And he's been a pretty good friend
Play my guitar for the girls I'm meetin'
Writing the songs from the books I'm readin'
I find it odd that I'm breaking even
Look at the money I've spent

[Chorus]
I'm going through life on a one way ticket
Ain't looking back, no, I don't want to miss it
I'm going to dip my toes in the river of life
Got a big bucket list, and before I kick it
Going to buy me a Harley and Route Sixty-Six it
Got a one way ticket and I'm going to enjoy the ride

[Verse 2]
Threw a dart at the map and it landed on Phoenix
She looked at me like I was from Venus
I grabbed the keys and she grabbed a Kleenex
I headed off into the night
I'm nothing more than a modern day Jonah
In the belly of a whale they call Arizona
Ordering hot wings and cold Coronas
Taking one town at a time

[Chorus]
I'm going through life on a one way ticket
Ain't looking back, no, I don't want to miss it
I'm going to dip my toes in the river of life
Got a big bucket list, and before I kick it
Going to buy me a Harley and Route Sixty-Six it
Got a one way ticket and I'm going to enjoy the ride

[Outro]
I'm going through life on a one way ticket
Want to visit New England and sail the Pacific
Gamble in Reno, give Frappuccino a try
Going to call up the boss man and tell him to stick it
Change the to-do's, to the already did it's
Got a one way ticket and I'm going to enjoy the ride
I got a one way ticket and I'm going to enjoy the ride
That's right
