[Verse 1]
I don't want to rush this thing
I don't want to jump the gun
I really want to say those three little words
But I'm going to bite my tongue
Yeah, I'm just going to lay on back
Leave it on cruise control
I'm gonna hold it all inside
Till the right time comes down the road

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
My head's a reeling
My heart is screaming
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a U
I got a feeling
Are you feeling it too

[Verse 2]
I guess I've all but said it now
So much for hoping you'd go first
Don't leave me hanging out here on a line
Baby, it's your turn
Say you couldn't sleep last night
Swore that you could feel me breathe
Had you wanting me there by your side
Yeah, baby I know what you mean

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
My head's a reeling
My heart is screaming
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a U
I got a feeling
Are you feeling it too

I got a feeling
My head's a reeling
My heart is screaming
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an I
And ends with a U
I got a feeling
Are you feeling it too
