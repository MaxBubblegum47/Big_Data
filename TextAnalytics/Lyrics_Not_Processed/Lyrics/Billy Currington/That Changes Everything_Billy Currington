[Verse 1]
I said, I know a shrimp boat captain out of Galveston
I've been thinking I'd go down and work for a spell
Oh, you never can tell it just might suit me fine
Spend some time out on the bay
But then there's always cowboy work in Colorado
And I was thinking that that just might be the thing
Make a little pocket change I figure what the heck
Ain't nothing standing in my way
But then she smiled at me
Looked a while at me

[Chorus]
And that changes everything
That's a whole another deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rolling wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing
That changes everything

[Verse 2]
Well, I suppose on second thought this ole town ain't so bad
Wouldn't hurt me to unload this load of mine
And there's a for sale sign on a little house
I saw just about a mile or so from here
But I've always been the kind for pulling up the stakes
It's ain't never been like me to put down roots
But now I'm thinking, Who am I kidding?
I ain't going nowhere
When she smiles at me
Looks a while at me

[Chorus]
And that changes everything
That's a whole another deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rolling wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing
That changes everything

And that changes everything
That's a whole another deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rolling wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing
That changes everything
