[Verse 1]
We got really good, at
Rollin' my old mans jeep, out
With the head lights off, while
He was still asleep, and
We stayed out all night, cause
We knew all the right roads, yeah
We knew just where, the
Cops didn't go
Yeah we had our hungry hearts beatin' like thunder
We were kings of the summer on a double broken yellow line
Knew what life was all about, had it all figured out like a mount and a dashboard light

[Chorus]
We were watchin' the world go 'round
In a nowhere town
Livin' in a nowhere town
Map dot, Camelot, lost and found
In a nowhere town
Livin' in a nowhere town

[Verse 2]
Starts gettin' late, and
Your runnin' out of stars, so
You and your girl, go
Find a place to park, and
She leans in close, for
A knock-you-dead kiss
That's the kind of thing, that
You won't forget

[Refrain]
Two hearts in a chevy, we were sure we were ready and we knew we were headin' for paradise
Too young to know, that the streets of gold only go to the county line

[Chorus]
We were watchin' the world go 'round
In a nowhere town
Livin' in a nowhere town
Map dot, Camelot, lost and found
In a nowhere town
Livin' in a nowhere town

[Refrain]
All you wanna do is have a drink on the bank of a river
With your buddies little somethin' on a saturday night
Yeah the way the world was spinnin', we were on and we were in it
We were lovin' every minute, we were livin’ right

[Bridge]
Woah, yeah
No-oh-where town
Smack dab in the middle of a nowhere town
Woah-oh
Hey hey
Nowhere town
Hey
Nowhere town
Nowhere town
Smack dab in the middle of a little bit of nowhere town

[Chorus]
We were watchin' the world go 'round
In a nowhere town
Livin' in a nowhere town
Map dot, camelot, lost and found
In a nowhere town
Livin' in a nowhere town

[Refrain]
All you wanna do is have a drink on the bank of a river
With your buddies little somethin' on a saturday night
Yeah the way the world was spinnin', we were on and we were in it
We were lovin' every minute, we were livin’ right
All you wanna do is have a drink on the bank of a river
With your buddies little somethin' on a saturday night
Yeah the way the world was spinnin', we were on and we were in it
We were lovin' every minute, we were livin’ right

[Outro]
Woah-yeah
No-oh-where town
Nowhere town
