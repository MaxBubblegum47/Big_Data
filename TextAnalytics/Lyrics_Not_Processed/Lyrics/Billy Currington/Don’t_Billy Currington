[Verse 1]
Don't ya hate hearing that clock on the wall chiming
Saying it's time
And don't you just wish we could just stay right here together
All day long
You know it wouldn't be a crime
If we crawl back into bed
Got as close as we could get
Trying to figure out where this thing is going

[Chorus]
Baby, Baby don't
Don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you just stay a little bit longer
Got it going on
And I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger

[Verse 2]
If ya got to go
You got to know
I might go crazy
Here without you baby
We're living every kiss
You ain't leaving me like this
It just ain't right
Wait until tonight
To lite another flame
You know it wouldn't be the same as the fire we got burning this morning

[Chorus]
Baby, Baby don't
Don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you just stay a little bit longer
Got it going on
And I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger

[Bridge]
Love, no one else can love me like you do
You know, I ain't even close to through- loving you

[Chorus]
Baby, Baby don't
Don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you just stay a little bit longer
Got it going on
And I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger

[Outro]
Don't
Baby, Baby don't
No baby don't
(Baby, baby, oh, baby, baby don't)
Oh no, no, baby don't
(Baby, baby, oh, baby, baby don't)
You, Don't
Baby, Baby, Don't
