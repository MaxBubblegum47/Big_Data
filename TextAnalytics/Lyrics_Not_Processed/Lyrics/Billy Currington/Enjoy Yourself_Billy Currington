[Verse 1]
If you hear music from down the street
And you find yourself tapping your feet
Just ease on by if you want to
There's only one thing expected of you

[Chorus 1]
Enjoy yourself, have a big time
Dance a little dance, drink a little wine
Come on in, the water's fine

[Chorus 2]
Enjoy yourself, let it all hang out
And you'll know exactly what I'm talking about
If you come on over without a doubt
You'll enjoy yourself

[Verse 2]
Now you don't have to wonder what to wear
What in the world are you doing alone over there
While we're having a ball, just shaking it loose
Now come on sweet baby, ain't no excuse

[Chorus 1]
Enjoy yourself, have a big time
Dance a little dance, drink a little wine
Come on in, the water's fine

[Chorus 2]
Enjoy yourself, let it all hang out
And you'll know exactly what I'm talking about
If you come on over without a doubt
You'll enjoy yourself

Enjoy yourself, let it all hang out
And you'll know exactly what I'm talking about
If you come on over without a doubt
You'll enjoy yourself

[Outro]
So come on over, you going to really help out
And you'll enjoy yourself
