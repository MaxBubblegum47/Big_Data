[Verse 1]
Sure feels good, sure feels right
Sure enough feels like love tonight
Ain't no movie, ain't no bar
Ain't nothing out there beats where we are

[Chorus]
Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from

[Verse 2]
We've been working so hard, had no breaks
Got a lot of overdue love to make
If we get no sleep, well that's okay
About time me and you and me got this way

[Chorus]
Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from

[Bridge]
Well, come on baby, we can't stop now
No giving in 'til we both give out

[Chorus]
Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from

[Verse 3]
We're just getting' started, ain't this fun
There's a whole lot more where that came from
Yeah, there's a whole lot more where that came from
Oh yeah
