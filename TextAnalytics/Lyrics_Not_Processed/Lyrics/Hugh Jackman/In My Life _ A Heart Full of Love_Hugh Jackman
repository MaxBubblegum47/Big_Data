[COSETTE]
How strange
This feeling that my life's begun at last
This change
Can people fall in love so fast?
What's the matter with you, Cosette?
Have you been too much on your own?
So many things unclear
So many things unknown
In my life
Ever so many questions and answers
That somehow seems wrong
In my life
There are times when I catch in the silence
The sigh of the faraway song
And it sings
Of a world that I long to see
Out of reach
Just a whisper away waiting for me
Does he know I'm alive?
Do I know if he's real?
Does he see what I see
Does he feel what I feel
In my life
I'm no longer alone
Now the love in my life is so near
Find me now
Find me here

[VALJEAN]
Dear Cosette
You're such a... a lonely child
How pensive, how sad you seem to me
Believe me
Were it within my power
I'd fill each passing hour
How quiet it must be
I can see
With only me for company

[COSETTE]
There's so little I know that I'm longing to know
Of the man that you were in a time long ago

[VALJEAN, spoken]
Please Cosette

[COSETTE]
There's so little you say of the life you have known
Why you keep to yourself
Why we're always alone
So dark, so dark and deep
The secrets that you keep
In my life
Please forgive what I say
You are loving and gentle and good
But Papa
Dear Papa
In your eyes I am still like the child
Who's lost in a wood

[VALJEAN]
No more words
No more words it's a time that is dead
There are words
That are better unheard, better unsaid

[COSETTE]
In my life
I'm no longer a child
And I yearn for the truth that you know
Of the years
Years ago

[VALJEAN]
You will learn
Truth is given by God to us all in our time
In our turn

[MARIUS]
In my life
She has burst like the music of angels
The light of the sun
And my life
Seems to stop as if something is over
And something has scarcely begun
Eponine
You're the friend who has brought me here
Thanks to you I am at one with the gods
And Heaven is near!
And I soar through a world that is new that is free

[EPONINE]
Every word that he says is a dagger in me!
In my life
There's been no one like him anywhere
Anywhere, where he is
If he asked
I'd be his

[MARIUS & EPONINE]
In my life
There is someone who touches my life

[MARIUS]
Waiting near

[EPONINE]
Waiting here

[MARIUS]
A heart full of love
A heart full of song
I'm doing everything all wrong
Oh God, for shame
I do not even know your name
Dear Madamoiselle
Won't you say?
Will you tell?

[COSETTE]
A heart full of love
No fear, no regret

[MARIUS]
My name is Marius Pontmercy

[COSETTE]
And mine's Cosette

[MARIUS]
Cosette, I don't know what to say

[COSETTE]
Then make no sound

[MARIUS]
I am lost

[COSETTE]
I am found!

[MARIUS (EPONINE)]
A heart full of love
(He was never mine to lose)

[MARIUS & COSETTE (EPONINE)]
A heart full of you
(Why regret what cannot be?)

[MARIUS]
A single look and then I knew

[COSETTE (EPONINE)]
I knew it too
(These are words he'll never say, not to me)

[MARIUS (EPONINE)]
From today
(Not to me, not for me)

[MARIUS & COSETTE (EPONINE)]
Every day
(His heart full of love)
For it isn't a dream
Not a dream after all
(He will never feel this way)
