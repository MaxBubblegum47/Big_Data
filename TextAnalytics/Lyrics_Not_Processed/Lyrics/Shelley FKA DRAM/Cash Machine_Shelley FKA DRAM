[Hook]
I ain't talkin' to you broke bitches I got money now
All a nigga understand is- since that check came in
Everybody's talkin' like a nigga actin' funny now
That don't matter, all I hear is- since that check came in
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
Since that check came in

[Verse 1]
Don't you know that I got that bag
And best believe my mama straight
I sent some bands to Tatiana
And if I brought you out I'll pay your way
I copped a second set of goldens, these ones way more colder
I'm in the sky like all the time and now it's no layover
My records all across the wave and there was no payola
This money new, these hundreds blue, I'm talkin' no Crayola
My credit card is a plastic bankroll
Still keep that knot cause I get guap from paid shows
Got a palace in the cut layin' low
Talkin' to thatâ€”
It does whatever I say so

[Hook]
I ain't talkin' to you broke bitches I got money now
All a nigga understand is- since that check came in
Everybody's talkin' like a nigga actin' funny now
That don't matter, all I hear is- since that check came in
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
Since that check came in

[Verse 2]
I used to get the coldest shoulders
But now I get the hottest ass
How I feel bout you is lukewarm
It burns you up cause I got all this cash
I'm askin', "Where you work at
What kind of car you drive"
Beat down Accord, cashier up at Five Guys
I get thousands for the walk through inside
Night clubs, strip clubs, big bucks, yes sir that's right
You done got left if you don't got my new number
A rich man told me it's a part of the come up
Remember when they used to want me to shut up
Now it's ironic cause I only conversate with those hundreds

[Hook]
I ain't talkin' to you broke bitches I got money now
All a nigga understand is- since that check came in
Everybody's talkin' like a nigga actin' funny now
They don't matter, all I hear is- since that check came in
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
I love it when you talk to me
My cash machine, my cash machine
Since that check came in
