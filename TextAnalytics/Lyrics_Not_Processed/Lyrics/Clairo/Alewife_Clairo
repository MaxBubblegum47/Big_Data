[Verse 1]
In Massachusetts
Only 30 minutes from Alewife
I lay in my room
Wonderin' why I've got this life
I met you by surprise
You were hangin' out all the time
But you know you saved me from doin'
Something to myself that night

[Verse 2]
You called me seven times
One, two, three, four, on the line
I didn't mean to scare you
Just had the thoughts in my mind
They showed up to my door
My parents didn't know what for
Swear I could've done it
If you weren't there when I hit the floor

[Verse 3]
It's been so long
And you've been my sister all along
But you know I'll be alright
Eighth grade was never that tight
