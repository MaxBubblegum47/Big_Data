[Chorus]
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

[Verse 1]
You know I'll do anything you ask me to
But, oh my God, I think I'm in love with you
Standing here alone now
Think that we can drive around
I just wanna say
How I love you with your hair down
Baby, you don't gotta fight
I'll be here 'til the end of time
Wishing that you were mine
Pull you in, it's alright

[Chorus]
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

[Verse 2]
Honey, I don't want it to fade
There's things that I know could get in the way
I don't want to say goodbye
And I think that we could do it if we tried

[Chorus]
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

[Outro]
I think we could do it if we tried
(I think we could, I think we could do it
We could, we could, do it)
I think we could do it if we tried
(Sofia, know that you, you, you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime)
I think we could do it if we tried
(Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime)
I think we could do it if we tried
(Sofia, know that you, you, you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime)
I think we could do it if we tried
