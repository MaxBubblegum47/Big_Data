[Verse 1]
Living the dream
At least what the dream used to be
There's people I don't know that know me
I'm quite well off, relatively
Writer's block accompanied by some depression
Without these songs, what am I worth?
If I'm not singing, no one hears my words except her

[Chorus]
My backyard tree doesn't know what she needs
Or what she wants, she just grows on
She left me so low to the ground
She left me here without a sound
Paper news and pay-per-views
They're all but gone, but my tree lives on
Asked her how she came to survive
She whispered, "The mindless will thrive"

[Verse 2]
Day one at my therapist's building
All these cars are so expensive
I guess the money brings expenses (Pay up)
So run along through this life with no sure ending
Create what you like and break the rest
There's hope for more than just the best (Probably)

[Chorus]
My backyard tree doesn't know what she needs
Or what she wants, she just grows on
She left me so low to the ground
She left me here without a sound
Paper news and pay-per-views
They're all but gone, but my tree lives on
Asked her how she came to survive
She whispered, "The mindless will thrive"
