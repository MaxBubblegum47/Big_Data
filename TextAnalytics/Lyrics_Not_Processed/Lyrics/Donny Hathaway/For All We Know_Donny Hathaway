[Verse 1: Donny Hathaway]
For all we know
We may never meet again
Before you go
Make this moment sweet again
We won't say goodnight
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

[Verse 2: Donny Hathaway]
For all we know
This may only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples of a stream
So love me, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come
For all we know
