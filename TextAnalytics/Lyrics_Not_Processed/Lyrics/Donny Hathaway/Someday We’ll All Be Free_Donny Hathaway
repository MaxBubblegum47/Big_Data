[Verse 1]
Hang on to the world as it spins around
Just don't let the spin get you down
Things are moving fast
Hold on tight and you will last
Keep your self-respect, your manly pride
Get yourself in gear, keep your stride
Never mind your fears
Brighter days will soon be here

[Refrain]
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free, yeah

[Verse 2]
Keep on walking tall
Hold your head up high
Lay your dreams right up to the sky
Sing your greatest song
And you'll keep going, going on

[Refrain]
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free
Hey, just wait and see, some day we'll all be free, yeah
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free

[Outro]
It won't be long, take it from me, someday we'll all be free
Take it from me, take it from me, take it from me
