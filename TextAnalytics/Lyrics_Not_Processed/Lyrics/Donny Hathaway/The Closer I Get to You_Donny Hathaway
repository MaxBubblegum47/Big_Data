[Verse 1: Roberta Flack]
The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me

[Bridge: Donny Hathaway]
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

[Verse 2: Roberta Flack]
Lying here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a try

[Bridge: Donny Hathaway]
Oh, oh, sweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With the hearts in love they find
True love
In a special way

[Verse 3: Roberta Flack]
The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got
Your love has captured me

[Bridge: Donny Hathaway]
Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside
I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

[Verse 4: Roberta Flack]
The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving you all I've got
Your love has captured me

[Outro: 
Roberta Flack
 & Donny Hathaway]
The closer I get to you
A feeling comes over me (
Me, too
)
Falling closer, sweet as the gravity
The closer I get
 to you
