[Skit: Kenneth "Boobie" Williams]
Dudes can't appreciate, you know what I'm saying, county and wealth, you know what I mean, as far as like inner wealth, you know what I mean? When you see when you the fool

[Intro: Yo Gotti]
I'm in a jungle
Lions, tigers and gorillas and shit nigga
It's a lot of monkey ass niggas out here too
'Lotta hustle nigga
Rules, laws, strategy

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
10 million dollars later I'm a blessin' nigga
How a nigga rich but still stressin' nigga
Glock .40, Smith & Wesson nigga
Streets will never ever stop testin' niggas
Youngin' give 'em a head shot, send a message nigga
Part rapper, part goon, still finessin' nigga
I believe in hustle I don't fuck with luck
And it's fuck em kill em all if they don't fuck with us
Them three letters mean a lot boy, sacrifices
Cocaine Mafia, double check the prices
Niggas killin' niggas like they got a license
Niggas crossin' over like they Allen Iverson
Fuck that iPhone 6, they be trackin' niggas
I'm about to get a beeper, fade to black on niggas
Gotti, goodnight, I'm gone
I be back when they quit livin' through phones
When niggas put the gram down and pick the grams up
You got follows but no dollars man that shit ain't addin' up
Nah, and all the dirt I done, all the bricks I sold
I can't sleep at night, paranoid it shows
I be strapped on stage, fuck the award show
Cause I shoot this bitch up and only God knows

[Skit]
Yeah like I told you a long time ago fam, y'all gon' hold it against you. I keep fightin' doin' this to y'all. Every time I get somethin' in the mail whether it's favorable or not from the courts, I keep puttin' it down because y'all are my motivation. I appreciate the love

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Niggas ridin' gold rims and they mama po
And they kill a family member for that envelope'
I'm the Lionel Richie to these Commodores
We flipped pies to franchisin' Dominoes
I speak for dope boys every track I'm on
Until this day my people never rat or told
Posted 20 in, I'm talkin' fed pen
The line between us both have gained so very thin
Amongst my boys, I'm W.E.B. Du Bois
Souls of black folk to hustle wasn't a choice
Rap game everybody skimmin' off the top
Fuck the interest as long as you pull it off the lot
Hoes wanna fuck, haters wanna hate
Certified sack boy, black Ronald Reagan
Double M no longer that Buick Regal money
Nickel bag niggas so don't make me put a kilo on it
Negotiatin' for it or either we take it
Niggas even shootin' choppers in a fuckin' cadence
Fell out with some people that I still love
I guess that's how it goes when it's real blood
I remember countin' cash standin' in the trap
I turned my hat to the back, had a hundred stacks
60 M's later, it's 300 tax
Still losin' weight with the south on my back, nigga

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
I pray you play by the rules
I came so close to the edge
I pray you play by the rules
I came so close to the edge
I pray you live by these rules
We came so close to the edge
I pray you play by the rules

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Ain't no mercy young nigga
It's the jungle, locs
And I pray you rich forever
Gotti, I pray you rich forever
All my niggas I pray you rich forever
When you smokin' and you vibin' to this shit
I pray you rich forever my nigga
Hood Billionaire
