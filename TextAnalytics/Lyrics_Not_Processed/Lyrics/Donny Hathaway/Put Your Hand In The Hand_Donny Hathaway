[Chorus]
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself, and you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

[Verse 1]
Every time I look into the Holy Book, I want to tremble (Tremble)
When I read about the part where a carpenter cleared the temple
And those buyers and the sellers, no different, fellas
Than what you and I profess to be
And it causes me shame (Shame) to know that man is not what he should be

[Chorus]
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a good look at yourself, you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

[Verse 2]
Hey, my mama taught me how to pray, before I reached the age of seven
When I'm down on my knees (Down on my knees)
Hey, hey, I'm close to heaven
My daddy lived his life with two kids and a wife
And you've got to do what you've got to do
But he showed me enough of what it takes to see you through
This is what he used to tell me

[Chorus]
Put your hand in the hand of the man that stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea, oh yeah
You gotta take a good look at yourself, and you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee
Hey, put your hand in the hand of the man that stilled the water
