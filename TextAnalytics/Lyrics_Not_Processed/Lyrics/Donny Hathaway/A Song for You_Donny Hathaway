[Verse 1]
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs
I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life on stages
With ten thousand people watching

[Chorus]
But we're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you

[Verse 2]
I know 
your image of me
Is what I hoped to be
I treated you unkindly
But darling, can't you see?
There's no one more important to me
Baby, can't you see through me?

[Chorus]
'Cause we're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you

[Bridge]
You taught me precious secrets
Of a true love while holding nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody
'Cause my love is in there hiding

[Verse 3]
I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
'Cause you' re a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together

[Chorus]
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you

[Verse 4]
I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
'Cuz you' re a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together

[Chorus]
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you
We were alone
And I was singing this song
Singing this song to you
