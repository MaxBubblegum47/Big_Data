Left side, sway, right side, sway

[Verse 1: NexXthursday]
I think this girl on the molly
Either that or she a party girl
I think this girl off a molly
Look how you shakin' your body girl
Damn I'm too drunk to be trippin'
Girl, I'm on plenty of liquor
Girl I brought all of my niggas
Hope you know plenty of bitches (woo!)
You need to get on the phone, phone (brrrt)
Tell them lil mamas come now, now (brrrt)
She said, "I'm loving your sound, sound"
Baby, I wanna be down, down
She said, "I'm tryna get with you"
I wanna give you the business
She said, "My man can't fuck with you"
So I'm 'bout to make it official, yeah
I'm in my bag, I'm in my bag, I'm in my bag (I'm in my bag)
Your man in the cab, that's why he mad, na na na na-na
Get mad at your misses, never get mad at the nigga
She wanna roll with the realest
Homie, she know we them niggas

[Chorus: NexXthursday]
We pull up, new whip, skrrt skrrt, gang
New chick, new watch in my bag
I feel so fly in my BAPE
Left side, sway, right side, sway
Pull up, new whip, skrrt skrrt, gang
New chick, new watch in my bag
I feel so fly in my BAPE
Left side, sway, right side, sway

[Verse 2: Quavo]
With them wings on them doors, (skrrt) watch how I sway (skrrt)
Can't be talking to these hoes, (nope) sway (sway)
Yeah, north side of the North A
 (yeah, bow)
No, my niggas don't play (Migos)
Two-tone, Patek, dat way (Which way)
My bitch, she what? On fleek, she slays
Drop a white coco hardball (woo, white!)
Niggas wanna play with the softball, (don' play) get knocked out (pew, pew)
Ride 'round town wuth it, don't look down in it
Swim in this pool with me, I don't wanna drown
All these checks, hope they don't bounce (hope they don't bounce)
500 pounds equals 500 rounds (500 rounds, yeah)

[Chorus: NexXthursday]
We pull up, new whip, skrrt skrrt, gang
New chick, new watch in my bag
I feel so fly in my BAPE
Left side, sway, right side, sway

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Ay, ooh, ay, sway, sway, sway, sway
Ay, I did everything for my gang, gang, gang, hey
Bought like eight, nine diamonds chains for the gang
Gang goes first keep a three round burst
Bought my moms a $45,000 purse, yeehee
Ice so bright, pitch black, you gon' see me
Beep beep beep when I'm comin' through
All your dogs investigators, call 'em Blue's Clues
Goin' fast when I'm feeling furious, got you curious (skrr)
Bad bitch, she delirious in a tube top, tube sock
Get your top knocked if you talk down
Ask 'round, I'm the youngest, flyest shit walkin' 'round (gang)
