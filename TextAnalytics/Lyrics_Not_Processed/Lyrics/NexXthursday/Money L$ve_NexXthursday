[Verse 1]
When the bad girls they come around we
Start to play some Stevie Wonder
I'm a tell you something so you know right now
I'm a give her anything she want right now
I ever wonder what she'd buy me
I'd propose to that girl right now
I swear that I'd lock her down
I'll give her all my love right now

[Chorus]
I love her with my money
She loves the way I love her
She loves the way I love her
She in love right now
I never let her go no no
(No no, I cannot let her go right now)
(I cannot let her go)

[Verse 2]
I never let her go
And I never put her right through my woes
I'm a spend no matter how it costs
She get everything above the world
Cause I express my love with money
So you can never question how I feel
Cause you get it all from me, from me
So I'm have to lock your ass down
Like a criminal
No no, I don't ever ever wanna see her go
I don't wanna see her leave, no no
So I give her, give her anything she wants

[Chorus]
I love her with my money
She loves the way I love her
She loves the way I love her
She in love right now
I never let her go no no
(No no, I cannot let her go right now)
(I cannot let her go)
