Rocking gucci, your boyfriend rock lacoste
My life a movie, can't decide, live on both coasts?
This my jordan year, 23, lets have a toast
She say i do too much, girl you right, i just do the most
Wasn't gt kid but baby im gifted and talented
10k for a show baby fuck that 5th grade talent shit
10k for your clothes baby that ain't doing damage
Promise i remember when thеy made me feel abandoned
Thеy just wanna spend my bank, they be in the way
That small ol advance they got, i spent in a day
Trips to paris france, girl we going where you say
They be throwing shade, we still fucking anyway
(liana banks + nexxthursday chorus)
You looking like you really tryna touch me now
(well, ooh yeah)
You looking like you really tryna fuck me now

Well baby girl im really tryna cash you out
(well cash out cash out)
And if its really good i wanna fly you out
(ill fly out)
Fly out
