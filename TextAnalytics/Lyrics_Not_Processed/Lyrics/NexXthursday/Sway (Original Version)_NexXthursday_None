Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

[Chorus: NexXthursday]
We pull up new whip
Skrt skrt gang
New chick new watch in my bay
I feel so fly in my bay
Left side sway
Right side sway

Skrt skrt gang
New chick new watch in my bay

Left side sway
Right side sway

[Verse 1: NexXthursday]
I think this girl on the molly
Either that or she a party girl
I think this girl off of molly
Look how you shaking yo body girl
Damn I'm too drunk to be trippin'
Girl I'm off plenty of liquor
Girl I brought all of my niggas
Hope you know plenty of bitches
You need to get on the phone phone
Tell them lil' mamas come now now
She said I'm loving yo sound sound
Baby I wanna be down down
She said I'm tryna get wit ya
I wanna give you the business
She said my man can't fuck bitches
So I'm bout to make it official
I'm in my bay (bay, bay, bay)
Yo man in the cab that's why he mad nanananana
Get mad at yo Mrs
Never get mad at the nigga
She wanna roll with the realest
Hoping she know we them niggas

[Chorus: NexXthursday]
We pull up new whip

[Verse 2: Caleon Fox]
My flow so wavy you motion sick from my ocean
Oh yea
Dipped in my gold and you swimming within my tokens dive in
But oh no I don't play no game the sun is out so don't throw no shade
My wrist whip car fresh out the wash out pull up on yo bae
Like holla hot momma (sway)
Como se llama
She looking goddess AF
I'm on my lord Beerus-sama
Better yet I left right sway
Her levels hot momma sauna
Never put my drive in reverse
Build up my bands and my commas
I hit a 100 on a 25 (yea yea yea)
We to the rim and only getting higher
We rolling I'mma flex up in my whip, gang gang
All day pull up and I'mma left right sway oh yeah

[Chorus: NexXthursday]
We pull up new whip
Skrt skrt gang
New chick, new watch, in my bay

Left side sway

[Verse 3: Krow]
Pull up flexin' on these hoes
Money so green smell like dro'
So high I'm flying i stay low
Once I fuck her gotta go
Chain so Tamagachi
Wanna know more bout me
I do not like ice tea
But check out this ice please
Feel so clean it's attracting bees
Yo bitch wanna swallow me
80 on the dash yeah I feel that breeze
Lame boy don't you follow me
I'mma call Minikon if you want the shot
Leave you like a period without the dot
Diamonds on me dripping nigga just like a yacht
She fucking wit me in the shit that you bought
White whip call it whip cream
Smoke it in let out the steam
Paper counting all I see is green
Remember yeah she fucking with the team

[Chorus: NexXthursday]
We pull up new whip
Skrt skrt gang
New chick new watch in my bay
I feel so fly in my bay
Left side sway
Right side sway
We pull up new whip
Skrt skrt gang
New chick new watch in my bay
I feel so fly in my bay
Left side sway
Right side sway
