[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna argue with your ass all night
I don't wanna fuck up what we had, no no
I don't wanna keep making you mad, girl nah
Every time that you fucking cry
I'm gonna tell you that you fucking right

[Chorus]
Girl you right, yeah you know you right
Girl you right, yea you know you right
Girl you right, yea you know you right
You know you wrong but I'll still tell you that you right
Cause you fuck me right, girl you fucking right
Fuck me right, girl you fucking right
Girl you right, know you fuck me right
And I don't wanna hear you tell me no you're not

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna argue wit your ass all night
I just wanna lay under your ass all night
She just caught me texting back my last bitch, oh my
I was texting her don't text me back
She like oh yea, baby where you going
She put on her clothes
I take off her clothes
She like call that bitch, I turned off my phone
She said give me her number, I said girl what number
Every time I fuck up she get Jimmy Choos
And I swear to God she got a lotta shoes
Girl I know it's best to get away from you
Ratchet ratchet ratchet but she still my boo
You be wrong, girl you know you wrong
I lost 30 grand the last time you broke my phone
Then you keyed my car when I went to do a show
She gon fuck me right so I don't tell her that she wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna argue with your ass all night
Every time that you fucking cry
I'm gonna tell you that you fucking right

[Chorus]
Girl you right, yeah you know you right
Girl you right, yea you know you right
Girl you right, yea you know you right
You know you wrong but I'll still tell you that you right
Cause you fuck me right, girl you fucking right
Fuck me right, girl you fucking right
Girl you right, know you fuck me right
And I don't wanna hear you tell me no you're not

[Verse 2]
I don't want that, I don't want that
Girl it feel like you want drama, I don't want that
Damn it's been a long time since I been in your thigh
Mama saying fuck you but my mind tell me calm down
Cause I don't want any issues with you, no I don't need that
Pussy evil, you got demons
I just pray to God that you change that
Even if you don't I wanna take it down, in the morning
I can't even lie to you, girl I want it
I'm letting you slide for that shit you pulled tonight
Cause even when you wrong you still keep that pussy tight
So damn when you wrong, even when you wrong
Tell you what you need just so I could get yo legs
Soon as it's done I'm a treat you how I want
I don't give a fuck tonight I just want to fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna argue with your ass all night
I don't wanna fuck up what we had, no no
I don't wanna keep making you mad
Every time that you fuck me right, I'm a tell you that you fucking right

[Chorus]
Girl you right, yeah you know you right
Girl you right, yea you know you right
Girl you right, yea you know you right
You know you wrong but I'll still tell you that you right
Cause you fuck me right, girl you fucking right
Fuck me right, girl you fucking right
Girl you right, know you fuck me right
And I don't wanna hear you tell me no you're not
