[Verse 1: NexXthursday]
You got some issues, you got some issues
I'm with my niggas, you with your bitches
I mean, I'm with my niggas, you with your friends
No disrespect I won't say it again but
Please stop telling your girlfriends what be going on in my home
These girls tweeting 'bout me and I don't know none of these hoes
You don't be checkin them anyway
You like to play all that victim shit
You wanna front like you innocent
You the one getting us into shit
But when we got a problem you tell your momma
You tell your side to only your sidegirl
We go to bed and you want me to kiss you
Girl you got issues, you got some issues
Cause you got some issues
You got some issues
Yeah, you got some issues

[Verse 2: ?]
Boy for the record, you airin me out on your records
You callin' me out on my name
Why don't you tell em the facts cause you know
There's three sides to every story I know
The side that I'm telling gon' hurt your ego
Yea you a lie, but it's more than a lie
Don't even know how I tried, fucking around with your type
And you mad cause I'm back in the club
What you expect when all you show is neglect?
Boy as a matter of fact
Yea I been lying, but only to cover my crying
And you said that I got some issues
The truth is I fucking miss you
Don't let this thing get to your head nigga
Don't do something that you gon' regret nigga
You can tell your other I got some hands for her
I guess we got issues, oh we got some issues
Yeah, you got some issues
You got some issues
You's telling me I got issues
You got some issues
What you gonna do about it?
