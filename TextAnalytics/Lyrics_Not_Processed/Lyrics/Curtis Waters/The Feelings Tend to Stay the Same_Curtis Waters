[Intro]
Yeah yeah
We don't talk no more
Like we used to
We don't talk no more
Good job, Curtis!

[Chorus]
Fade away
My memories seem to fade
I can't recall what you said
But the feelings tend to stay the same
Fade away
My memories seem to fade
I can't recall what you said
But the feelings tend to stay the same

[Verse]
Messed up, messed up
I'm a mess, yeah
Countless problems, I confess, yeah
You can leave me, need be
If there's ever an issue
But I'll miss you so much
Grab the tissues
Please just call me  again
You know I need to hear you
Yeah your pure voice
My phone makes me  feel like i'm near you
Yeah I fucked up
Once, twice, three times
I start to fear you
I'm no  good for no one
I'll leave  before I tear you

[Bridge]
Hey
Know I appreciated when you helped me everyday
Threw up all night but you liked me enough to stay
Feelings ain't black or white, they end up grey
Hope you're okay
Hey
Know you on my mind every other minute of the day
Look past all signs ignore what friends might say
Feelings ain't black or white, they end up grey
Hope you're okay

[Chorus]
Fade away
My memories seem to fade
I can't recall what you said
But the feelings tend to stay the same
Fade away
My memories seem to fade
I can't recall what you said
But the feelings tend to stay the same
