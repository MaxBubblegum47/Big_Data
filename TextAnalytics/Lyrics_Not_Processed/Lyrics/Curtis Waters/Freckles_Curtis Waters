You lean on me when you're feeling alone and need some company
You call on me, lay on your lap I sleep so comfortably
Skip class again, just talk all night, yeah you're the one for me
Skip class again just talk all night
Good job, Curtis!

[Hook]
Freckles on your face
Your soft cheeks, they shining
Band-aids on your arm
Your scars they remind me
All that you've been through
But you're still here smiling
I think you're so cool, yeah
I think you're so cool, yeah
Freckles on your face
Your soft cheeks, they shining
Band-aids on your arm
Your scars they remind me
All that you've been through
But you're still here smiling
I think you're so cool, yeah
I think-

[Verse 1]
Once I get a few checks checks checks
You can run it up with me
Been feeling like I'm next next next
I know it's meant for me
I'll buy you a dress
Necklace, anything you need
I'm not tryna flex flex flex
You're enough for me
If love's a game
Then I'm winning
Unfamiliar feeling
Usually I don't feel alright
Usually I don't feel alright
Once I get it
Then I spend it
My girl looking splendid
I see me in a big ol' Wraith
I see me in a big ol' Wraith

[Bridge]
Ooh
Never let you go
Ooh
Do it all for you
And I'm deep
In it
Pussy felt so good
No one else, no one else
Ooh
Never let you go
Ooh
Do it all for you
And I'm deep
In it
Pussy felt so good
No one else, no one else
