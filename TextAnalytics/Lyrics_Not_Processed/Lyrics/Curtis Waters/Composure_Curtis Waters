You said we should talk but you did all the talking
I wanted to stay and you did all the walking
I wanted you and you wanted options, I guess
You left me just to go see him I guess
Seeing me wasn't like seeing him
All I can see is you seeing him
Fuck all my feelings I guess
Don't dap me up then hit my girl up after
Petty laughter, laughing at the
Fact you went behind my back I thought that
We were brother, different mothers
Keep it cordial when I run into you
Hardly speaking dawg, I seen through you
Don't hit me up after the fact
Fact is you folded
And you fucked up and you know it
