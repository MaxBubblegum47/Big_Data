[Verse 1]
I saw you first
Study hall with both of your friends
I know it hurts
Stuck inside my memory lane
I walked you home
It was cold and rainy that day
I walk alone
Now nothing is the same

[Verse 2]
If I loved you once
Then I might love you forever
Hold your tongue
Because my eyes might get wetter
And I'm sure it hurts
You can cry on my sweater, for help (for help, woah-oh, oh-woah-oh)

[Verse 3]
Yeah I loved you twice
And we came back to the center
Nothing's fixed
And I know nothing gets better
You go from warm to freezing
Like the Calgary weather, for real (for real, for real oh-woah)

[Refrain]
I ask
How are you?
I hope you're doing fine
I hope you're doing fine, yeah
If you knew
I'm in the back of the car I feel like I might die alone
How are you?
I hope you're doing fine
I hope you're doing fine, yeah
If you knew
I'm in the back of the car I feel like I might die alone

[Verse 4]
My friends
Are so high
I can't breathe
Paranoid
Heart beat
Is racing
I'm shaking
I'm annoyed
In the back of the car
And I'm barely home
In the back of the car
And I'm barely home
Hate on us
Yeah they, hate on us
All my old friends left me in the dust
Polaroid pictures on my purse
Polaroid pictures of her

[Bridge]
Like woah
And I melt into the floor-ooohh
Saw you by the door-ooohh
Walkin' in with someone else
My friend's like where'd he go-ooohh
Really need to let you know-ooohh
Slurring all my woohhh-rds
'Cause I'm too fucked up

[Refrain]
I ask
How are you?
I hope you're doing fine
I hope you're doing fine, yeah
If you knew
I'm in the back of the car I feel like I might die alone
How are you?
I hope you're doing fine
I hope you're doing fine, yeah
If you knew
I'm in the back of the car I feel like I might die alone

[Beat Switch]
3, 2, 1, go!

[Verse 5]
I ain't perfect
I ain't perfect
I ain't perfect
I don't know
I'm a burden
I'm a burden
No, I'm not
I've just been hurtin'
I've been tryin'
Hope you knew
Thought of dyin'
Nothing new
Nothing new
Nothing new
Woah-oh-oh

[Verse 6]
Hey!
Runaway. runaway. runaway
You can't stop me
Hey!
Run away. run away. run away
Until nothing hurts me
Don't
Follow me follow me
There ain't nothing for me
There ain't nothing for me
It won't ever be the same

[Outro]
Yeah yeah
It won't ever be the same
Yeah yeah
It won't ever be the same
Yeah yeah
It won't ever be the same
Yeah yeah
It won't ever be the same
