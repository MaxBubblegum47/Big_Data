[Verse 1]
You're like a highway to a rebel that's ready to run
A no trespass sign on a barbwire jump
That I can't resist, that's just the way it is
You're a don't touch red button I want to push
A bad for me that feels so good
And we both know I can't say no

[Chorus]
Cause a phone call turns into a what's up, what's up
Turns into "baby, can you pick me up?"
Hey, I'm downtown and I don't wanna go home
After two left turns it's you and me alone
Turns into tangled up on my couch with you
Slipping your kisses right across my mouth
And that turns into later on
Later on, lights turned down
Cause I can't turn you down

[Verse 2]
I could say that I ain't picking up next time
I could say I don't want it, but I'd be lying
Cause baby the truth is I want you
And there ain't a damn thing I can do

[Chorus]
A phone call turns into a what's up, what's up
Turns into "baby, can you pick me up?"
Hey, I'm downtown and I don't wanna go home
After two left turns it's you and me alone
Turns into tangled up on my couch with you
Slipping your kisses right across my mouth
And that turns into later on
Later on, lights turned down
Cause I can't turn you down

[Bridge]
You're like my favorite song
I can't turn you off

[Chorus]
A phone call turns into a what's up, what's up
Turns into "baby, can you pick me up?"
Hey, I'm downtown and I don't wanna go home
After two left turns it's you and me alone
Turns into tangled up on my couch with you
Slipping your kisses right across my mouth
And that turns into later on
Later on, lights turned down
Cause I can't turn you down
No, I can't turn you down
Can't turn you down
