[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand
So I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye
Lke nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air
The California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything
So I sang along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

[Verse 2]
So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closing time
My little mystery
That girl is killing me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about

[Bridge]
So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know

[Chorus]
You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hanging around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
