[Verse 1]
Appreciate your call
Means a lot and all
Yeah, I got a minute
You and me can talk
About anything you want
As long as she ain't in it

[Verse 2]
Say, it's been at least a month
Since I've had any fun
Buddy, I'll admit it
Yeah, I'm into going out
Think I'm ready for a crowd
As long as she ain't in it

[Chorus]
Don't wanna hear her name
I don't wanna see her face, I swear
I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere

[Verse 3]
We could hit that place
Down by the interstate
Out past the city limits
Hangout all night long
Hear a country song
As long as she ain't in it

[Chorus]
Don't wanna hear her name
I don't wanna see her face, I swear
I know its gonna hurt
If I run into her somewhere

[Outro]
I can drink and I can dance
I can party, I can laugh
But no matter how you spin it
Everything has changed
My life won't be the same
As long as she ain't in it
As long as she ain't in it, no
