[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
You're all alone at a party, you wanna dance with somebody
But you ain't got a clue how to ask
You and your girl had a fight and now she's sayin' goodbye
She ran upstairs and packed her bags

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta listen to me, but all I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, or heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
There ain't nothing that a beer can't fix

[Verse 2: Jon Pardi]
You're on a lake and you're fishin'
It's hot and all that you're gettin' is a little nibble here and there
You're sitttin', watchin' your team losin' that championship ring
And you're feelin like life ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Pardi]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation

[Chorus: Jon Pardi]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix (Yeehaw)

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett & 
Jon Pardi
]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta save it for no special occasion

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett, 
Jon Pardi
 & 
Both
]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away, no
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely
 (Lonely)
Heartbroken
 (Heartbroken)
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
 (So quick)
It might take one or it might take six
Drink it down, it will do the trick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
