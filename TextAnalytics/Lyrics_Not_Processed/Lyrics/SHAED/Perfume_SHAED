[Verse 1]
You better believe I fell in love with you
Dippin the pen again cause I want to claim you
I’ll write the rules and you will sign your name
Ink dries, I cut ties so move quickly my dear

[Pre-Chorus]
They say I eat the greatest cake
I do and you can’t stop me
Take off
I can’t stand it
No more

[Chorus]
Baby I choose you
Like new perfume
Not gonna lose you
Never gonna wash you off

[Verse 2]
Drippin' grace outside as I sip my tea
Conversations closed til you send me your deal
I’m not the type to sit and wait around
Rather have another drink and drown

[Pre-Chorus]
They say I eat the greatest cake
I do and you can’t stop me ooo
Take off
I can’t stand it
No more

[Chorus]
Baby I choose you
Like new perfume
Not gonna lose you
Never gonna wash you off

[Bridge]
Cause you’re like perfume all on me
Cause you’re like perfume all on me
I’m gonna wear you endlessly
Perfume on me
Perfume on me

[Chorus]
Baby I choose you
Like new perfume
Not gonna lose you
Never gonna wash you off
Never gonna wash you off

[Outro]
Can’t stop
Can’t stop
Can’t stop
Never gonna wash you off
Can’t stop
Can’t stop watching you
Can’t stop
Cause you’re like perfume
