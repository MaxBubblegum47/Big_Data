[Verse 1]
Can we take a break from this life?
Set our worries to the side
Live a day like it's ours
Share an evening with the stars

[Pre Chorus]
Let's eat, honey, pick me up
Smile at you, I'll never stop
Wanna be doin' that couple stuff
I'm tired of being lonely

[Chorus]
I just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see

[Verse 2]
I should remember when it's hard
It's only 'cause we've been apart
Terrified by the space
So when I get you in my place

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's just eat then, honey, pick me up
Smile at you until we drop
Wanna be doin' that couple stuff
I'm tired of being lonely

[Chorus]
I just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face

[Bridge]
You standing there
And I watching you, darling, you better
Get over here
Close your eyes and let your mind run free

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna see
Just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I'm tired of being lonely
I just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now

[Outro]
Wanna
Wanna
See your
Face, face, face
