I’ve been talking to myself at night
It feels good
It feels right
Mental pictures of a silver knife
In your chest
It feels right

I’ve had enough (ah)
I don’t wanna see you cry
That’s not enough (ah)
Guess i’m gonna take a life

Standing over you
Look what you made me do
Nobody in sight
Just me you and a knife

Push a finger through your eye
It feels cool
It feels right
I dream about it every night
It’s so real
It’s so nice

I’ve had enough (ah)
I don’t wanna see you cry
That’s not enough (ah)
Guess i’m gonna take a life

Standing over you
Look what you made me do
Nobody in sight
Just me you and a knife

Ah ah

Standing over you
Look what you made me do
Nobody in sight
Just me you and a knife
Standing over you
Look what you made me do
Nobody in sight
Just me you and a knife

Ah ah

Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Me, you, and a knife
Me, you, and a knife

Standing over you
Look what you made me do
Nobody in sight
Just me you and a knife
Standing over you
Look what you made me do
Nobody in sight
Just me you and a knife
Standing over you
Look what you made me do
Nobody in sight
Just me you and a knife
