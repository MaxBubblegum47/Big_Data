[Verse 1]
I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm lookin' up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees, spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me

[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved (So loved)

[Verse 2]
I've been havin' dreams
Splashin' in the summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushin' weight of paradise
Solid block of gold, lyin' in the cold
I feel right at home

[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved

[Bridge]
I never feel so loved
La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la

[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love? (Deep in love)
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved
