[Intro]
Wherever you are

[Verse 1]
We walked up to the tower
They looked down from above
I never dreamed trouble could be coming from
So few people


[Chorus]
Wherever you are
Let's get loud like thunder
Know in your heart
They won't drag us under
They can blow, every brick we lay will make us stronger

[Verse 2]
All we heard was a whisper
When they paid for a beating drum
They never dreamed together we could make a sound
That would drive them out


[Chorus] (x3)
Wherever you are
Let's get loud like thunder
Know in your heart
They won't drag us under
They can blow, every brick we lay will make us stronger

[Outro]
Thunder
Thunder
Every brick we lay will make us stronger
