[Verse 1]
I was stopped in London when I felt it coming down
Crashing all around me with a great triumphant sound
Like the dam was breaking and my mind came rushing in
I was stopped in London, oh, I was awakening, I was

[Verse 2]
I was o'er in Paris when I almost ran away
Two times 'round the block before I decided to stay
Puffed along a cigarette that went and made me sick
Spent another day pretending I was over it

[Chorus]
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (Back in my body)
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm back in my body, oh
I'm back in my body, oh

[Verse 3]
And all along the highway, there's a tiny whispering sound
Saying I could find you in the dark of any town
But all that I am hearing in the poem of my mind
Are silent twisted words finding their way in every line

[Refrain]
Oh, this time
Oh, this time

[Chorus]
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (Back in my body)
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (Back in my body)
Lost you in the border town of anywhere
I found myself when I was going everywhere (Back in my body)
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm

[Break]
(Back in my body)
(Back in my body)
(Back in my body)

[Bridge]
Oh, this time, oh, this time
Oh, this time, oh, this time
Oh, this time, oh, this time
Oh, this time, oh, this time

[Chorus]
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (Back in my body)
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm (Back in my body)
Lost you in the border town of anywhere
I found myself when I was going everywhere
This time, I know I'm fighting
This time, I know I'm back in my body, oh
I'm back in my body, oh
I'm back in my body, oh
Back in my body, oh, oh
