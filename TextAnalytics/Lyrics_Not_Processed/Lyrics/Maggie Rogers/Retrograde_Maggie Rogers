[Verse 1]
You said, "I can't take no more"
Lying by the sycamore
And I know we've both been here before
You said, "Fuck, let's leave the blame"
But heartache always feels the same
And I know we've both been here before

[Chorus]
Oh, here I am, settled in at your house
Broken blinds keep the light coming out
And I am just the shape I'm in
Ooh, here I am, settled in, crying out
Finding all the things that I can't do without
Oh, I am giving in
Oh, I'm in retrograde
Oh, I'm in retrograde
Retrograde

[Verse 2]
Standing staring straight ahead
Listening when Stevie says, mmm
"Come out of the darkness"
Feeling all I've ever known
Fall away and letting go
Oh, come out of the darkness

[Chorus]
Ooh, here I am, settled in on your floor
Quieting all the world outside your door
And I am reckoning
Oh, here I am, settling, freaking out
You bring me in to help me, let me get me out
Oh I, I, I, I'm in retrograde
I'm in retrograde

[Outro]
Oh, if only I could give in
If I could get out
If only I could break in
If you could let me out
If only I could let go
If I could sit out
If only I could get back
If I could let me out
Oh, I'm in retrograde
Yeah, mmm
I'm in retrograde
Ooh, ooh, ooh
