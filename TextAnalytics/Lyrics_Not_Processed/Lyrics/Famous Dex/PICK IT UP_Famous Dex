I got three phones, business, conversation, and relation
Hol' up, wait a sec', wait a min', wait a tic
Jacob my wrist, nothing was fake on my wrist
Four finger ring on my hand
Say what you say to my wrist, talk to the hand
Don't wanna resort to the hands
What the face say to the fist? (

My shit might go platinum first week (Uh)
Play this shit back and repeat it (Uh)
Word around, word of mouth, word around town
You the one doin' all the murder 'round town
Pullin' up, shootin', leave the burner downtown
Shoot it like the birdy 'cause they all fly south
Whippin', I'm whippin', I'm whippin' the wrists
I'm fucking your bitch and I'm up in your fridge
I only tell stories of tuckin' in kids
So how in the fuck can they fuck with the kid?

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Hah, funny as shit, I was missing a bit
I'm back in my bag, back to the pad
Watched "Dexter's Lab" on the 'Flix
Good job, 1st
