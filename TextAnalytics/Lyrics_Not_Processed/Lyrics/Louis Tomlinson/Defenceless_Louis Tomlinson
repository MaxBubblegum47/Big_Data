[Verse 1]
I come runnin' to you like a moth into a flame
You tell me, "Take it easy," but it's easier to say
Wish I didn't need so much of you
I hate to say, but I do
We're sleepin' on our problems like we'll solve them in our dreams
We wake up early morning and they're still under the sheets
I'm lost in my head, I'm spinnin' again
Tryna find what to say to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Been up all night
All night runnin' all my lines
But it’s only the truth
Been up all night
Not sure how to say this right
Got so much to lose

[Chorus]
Never been so defenceless (
Oh
)
Never been so defenceless (
Ooh
)
You just keep on buildin' up your fences (
Oh
)
But I've never been so defenceless (
Ooh
)

[Post-Chorus]
(
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)
(
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)
You just keep on buildin' up your fences (
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)
But I've never been so defenceless (
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)

[Verse 2]
No, you don’t have to keep on being strong for me and you
Acting like you feel no pain, you know I know you do
And I can't get inside when you're lost in your pride
But you don't have a thing to prove

[Pre-Chorus]
Been up all night, all night runnin' all my lines
But it's only the truth
Been up all night, not sure how to say this right
Got so much to lose

[Chorus]
Never been so defenceless (
Oh
)
Never been so defenceless (
Ooh
)
You just keep on buildin' up your fences (
Oh
)
But I've never been so defenceless (
Ooh
)

[Post-Chorus]
(
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)
(
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)
You just keep on buildin' up your fences (
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)
But I've never been so defenceless (
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)

[Bridge]
I hope that I'm not asking too much
Just wanna be loved by you
 
(Don't you be so defensive)
And I'm too tired to be tough
Just wanna be loved by you

[Chorus]
Never been so defenceless
Never been so defenceless
And you just keep on buildin' up your fences
But I've never been so defenceless

[Post-Chorus]
(
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)
(
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)
You just keep on buildin' up your fences (
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)
Defenceless (
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)

[Chorus]
Never been so defenceless (
Oh
)
Never been so defenceless (
Ooh
)
You just keep on buildin' up your fences (
Oh
)
But I've never been so defenceless (
Ooh
)
