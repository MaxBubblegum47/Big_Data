[Verse 1]
I went to Amsterdam without you
And all I could do was think about you
And oh-oh-oh, I should've known
I went to Tokyo to let it go
Drink after drink, but I still felt alone
I should've known

[Pre-Chorus]
I went to so many places
Looking for you in their faces
I can feel it, oh, I can feel it

[Chorus]
I'm wastin' my time when it was always you, always you
Chasin' the high, but it was always you, always you
Should've never let you go-oh-oh
Should've never let you go-oh, my baby
Go-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I went from LAX to Heathrow
Walked through my door, but it felt nothing like home
'Cause you're not home
Waiting to wrap your legs around me
And I know you hate to smoke without me
And, oh-oh-oh, now you know

[Chorus]
I'm wastin' my time when it was always you, always you
Chasin' the high, but it was always you, always you
Should've never let you go-oh-oh
Should've never let you go-oh, my baby
Go-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Should've never let you go-oh-oh
Should've never let you go-oh, my baby
Go-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I went to so many places
Looking for you in their faces
I can feel it, oh, I can feel it

[Chorus]
Wastin' my time when it was always you, always you
I was chasin' the high, but it was always you, always you
Should've never let you go-oh-oh
Should've never let you go-oh, my baby
Go-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Should've never let you go-oh-oh
Should've never let you go-oh, my baby
Go-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
My baby
Oh, my baby
