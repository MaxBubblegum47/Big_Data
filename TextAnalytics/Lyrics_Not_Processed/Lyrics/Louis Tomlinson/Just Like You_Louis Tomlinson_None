[Verse 1]
It's the guy from the one band
Cigarette in my left hand
Whole world in my right hand
25 and it's all planned
Night out and it's ten grand
Headlines that I can't stand

[Pre-Chorus]
But you only get half of the story
The cash, and the cars and the glory
No sleep and we party 'til morning
'Cause nobody cares when you're boring

[Chorus]
I'm just like you
Even though my problems look nothing like yours do
Yeah, I get sad too
And when I'm down I need somebody to talk to
Yeah, I feel the same as you would do
Same stress, same shit to go through
I'm just like you
If you only knew

[Verse 2]
If I had it my way, pub lunch every Sunday
Cheap beer and it's okay
I wanna lay where she lays
I wanna stay in these days
Gonna smoke and it's okay

[Pre-Chorus]
But you only get half of the story
The cash, and the cars and the glory
Just like everyone else here before me
'Cause nobody cares when you're boring

[Chorus]
I'm just like you
Even though my problems look nothing like yours do
Yeah, I get sad too
And when I'm down I need somebody to talk to
Yeah, I feel the same as you do
Same stress, same shit to go through
I'm just like you
If you only knew

[Post-Chorus]
I'm just like you
When I'm down I need somebody to talk to
I'm just like you
When I'm down I need somebody to talk to

[Bridge]
Every heart breaks the same
Every tear leaves a stain
Can I just be the same?
Every heart breaks the same
Every tear leaves a stain
Let me be the same

[Chorus]
I'm just like you
Even though my problems look nothing like yours do
Yeah, I get sad too
And when I'm down I need somebody to talk to
Yeah, I feel the same as you do
Same stress, same shit to go through
I'm just like you
If you only knew

[Post-Chorus]
I'm just like you
When I'm down I need somebody to talk to
I'm just like you
When I'm down I need somebody to talk to

[Outro]
If you only knew
