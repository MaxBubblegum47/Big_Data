[Verse 1]
On our way to Twenty Seven
Got a place on the other side of London
Doing better, doing better
And I know you left a part of you
In New York under your bed in a box
But you're doing better, doing better

[Pre-Chorus]
Life gets hard and it gets messed up
When you give so much, but it's not enough
When the high's too high and the low's too low
When you love someone and they let you go

[Chorus]
Don't you let it kill you
Even when it hurts like hell
Oh, whatever tears you apart
Don't let it break your heart
Time takes time to heal it
You can't do it by yourself
Oh, whatever tears you apart
Don't let it break your heart

[Verse 2]
It comes, it goes
We're driving down a one-way road
To something better, something better
What hurts you is gonna pass and
You'll have learnt from it when it comes back
You'll be doing better, yeah, doing better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause life gets hard and it gets messed up
When you give so much, but it's not enough
When the high's too high and the low's too low
When you love someone and they let you go

[Chorus]
Don't you let it kill you
Even when it hurts like hell
Oh, whatever tears you apart
Don't let it break your heart
Time takes time to heal it
You can't do it by yourself
Oh, whatever tears you apart
Don't let it break your heart

[Bridge]

(
Oh

(
Oh
)
Don't let it break your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause life gets hard and it gets messed up
When you give so much and it's not enough
When the high's too high and the low's too low
When you love someone and they let you go

[Chorus]
Don't you let it kill you
Even when it hurts like hell
Oh, whatever tears you apart
Don't let it break your heart
Time takes time to heal it
You can't do it by yourself
Oh, whatever tears you apart
Don't let it break your heart

[Outro]
Don't let it break your heart (
Oh
)
Don't let it break your heart (
Oh
)
Don't let it break your heart (
Oh
)
Don't let it break your heart (
Oh, don't let it break your heart
)
Don't let it break your heart (
Oh
, oh, don't let it)
Don't let it break your heart (
Oh
, break your heart, no, no)
Don't let it break your heart (
Oh
)
Don't let it break your heart (
Oh, don't let it break your heart
)
