[Verse 1]
So I heard you found somebody else
And at first I thought it was a lie
So I took all my things that make sounds
And the rest I can do without

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
A love gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
And leaving with somebody else
No I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else

[Verse 2]
Come on, baby
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
Come on, baby
You said you'd find someone to take my place
Oh I don't believe that you have got it in you
Cause we are just gonna keep doin' it and every time
I start to believe in anything you're sayin'
I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
A love gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
And leaving with somebody else
No I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody else

[Bridge]
Get someone you love
Get someone you need
Fuck that, get money
Cause I can't give you my soul cause we're never alone
Get someone you love
Get someone you need
Fuck that, get money
Cause I can't give you my soul cause we're never alone
Get someone you love
Get someone you need
Fuck that, get money
Cause I can't give you my soul cause we're never alone
Get someone you love
Get someone you need
Fuck that, get money
Cause I can't give you my soul and

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
A love gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
And leaving with somebody else
No I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else

[Outro]
No I don't want your body
I don't want your body with somebody else
No I don't want your body
I don't want your body with somebody else
