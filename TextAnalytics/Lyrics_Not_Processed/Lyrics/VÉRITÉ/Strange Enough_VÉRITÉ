[Intro]
'Cause I wanna fall
But every time, you leave me down on the floor
Memories keep rushing 'round
'Cause nothing ever stays the same

[Verse 1]
'Cause maybe I'm just addicted to
The things I lack and the way you move
In circles run, 'round a figure eight
Always running off, meeting up in the same place
Slow down
Pick up the pieces, I've found
We're living our lives half asleep
Living our lives half asleep

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna go
Where everything's the same
Memories keep rushing 'round
And all we do is change
'Cause I wanna fall
But every time, you leave me down on the floor
Picturing the ways we move
'Cause nothing ever stays the same

[Verse 2]
Separate a fragile spine
A hollow hope
Just to make things right
I've been picking up pieces slowly
And wondering why you hold me
Take me back to the way it was before

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna go
Where everything's the same
Memories keep rushing 'round
And all we do is change
'Cause I wanna fall
But every time, you leave me down on the floor
Picturing the ways we move
'Cause nothing ever stays the same

[Bridge]
Strange enough, I don't love you like you want me to
Strange enough, I don't love you like you want me to

[Chorus]
Strange enough ('Cause I wanna go where everything's the same)
I don't love you (Memories keep rushing 'round)
Like you want me to (And all we do is change)
Strange enough ('Cause I wanna fall but every time, you leave me down on the floor)
I don't love you (Picturing the ways we move)
Like you want me ('Cause nothing ever stays the same)

[Outro]
Like you want
