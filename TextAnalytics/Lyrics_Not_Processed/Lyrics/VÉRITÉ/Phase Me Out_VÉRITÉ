[Ve
r
se 1]
Watch it all play out
Reactions too familiar
The way I act is similar
To how I see it in my mind
Say just what you mean
But love I don't believe in
The days we spend are fleeting
And passing by the time

[Chorus]
Stand up straighter
With my back against the wall
Keep me still
And wondering just why we falter
Don't you want to stay here
Or do you want to phase me out?
Don't you want to lay here
Or would you rather do without?

[Bridge]
Eventually you'll crack
And remember there's no need for
Siphoning some reason
From a dissipating line we drew

[Chorus]
Stand up straighter
With my back against the wall
Keep me still
And wondering just why we falter
Don't you want to stay here
Or do you want to phase me out?
Don't you want to lay here
Or would you rather do without?

[Chorus]
Stand up straight
With my back against the wall
Keep me still
And wondering just why we falter
Don't you want to stay here
Or do you want to phase me out?
Don't you want to lay here
Or would you rather do without?

[Outro]
Don't you want to stay here
Or do you want to phase me out?
