[Verse 1]
I know what's going on
Please don't say a word
Everything I want, will I ever learn?
When the lights go out
There's no time to think
A kiss and I'm gone
Full of dreams was never
Who she seems when you're together
Made you believe she was better
Got under your skin cause you let her

[Chorus]
Something that I should tell you
There's something that you should know
This is just a feeling
I wish it could be more

[Verse 2]
I don't have the time
Never found a way
Every time I'm close, I try to escape
Always on my mind
Always in my face
A kiss and I'm gone
Lying, keep it together
Looking for something better
I can't do this forever
Baby, it's now or never

[Chorus]
Something that I should tell you
There's something that you should know
This is just a feeling
I wish it could be more

[Bridge]
This is just a feeling
Is this just a feeling?
This is just a feeling
I wish it could be more

[Chorus]
Something that I should tell you
There's something that you should know
This is just a feeling
I wish it could be more

This is just a feeling
This is just a feeling
This is just a feeling

Never felt before
