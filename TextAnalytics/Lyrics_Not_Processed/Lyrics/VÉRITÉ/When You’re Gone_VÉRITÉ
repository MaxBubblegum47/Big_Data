[Verse 1]
Sitting in depression
Always calling me irreverent
If I prayed the weight would lessen
But your mouth can do it better
Than some god who don't speak
Fucking up my language
Mixing words but never fading
If you stay you'll say you saved me
You can take it all away
When you leave I'll feel the same, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind you leaving when the damage is done
And I don't mind, I feel the same when you're gone

[Chorus]
'Cause what you lost, what you lost
I don't wanna be here anymore, anymore
There's no difference here from when you're gone, when you're gone
I'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here
'Cause what you lost, what you lost
I don't wanna be here anymore, anymore
There's no difference here from when you're gone, when you're gone
I'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here

[Verse 2]
Baby take me back to New York City
Where the stars don't ever see me
I can hide under the scenery of a saturated sky
Share some conjugated meaning
Watch the light drip down your face
And when you'll leave I'll feel the same, ohh

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind you leaving when the damage is done
And I don't mind, I feel the same when you're gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause what you lost, what you lost
I don't wanna be here anymore, anymore
There's no difference here from when you're gone, when you're gone
I'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here
'Cause what you lost, what you lost
I don't wanna be here anymore, anymore
There's no difference here from when you're gone, when you're gone
I'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here
(I'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here)
(I'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here)
(I'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here)
