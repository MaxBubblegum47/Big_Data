[Verse 1]
Tell me what you want from me, boy
Why you gotta act so needy?
Maybe you were what I'm missing
Maybe I crave your affection
Everything you say cuts me, boy
Why don’t you just let me heal ya?
Why do I feel like I'm searching?
Without you, boy, I feel nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
Tear me down, you hurt me
Change your mind, want me again
Playin' with my heart and I turn blind
Blind again

[Chorus]
Tell me that I’m all that you need, babe (Oh)
Longing for my company, hey
You're pushing me 'round
Look at what I'm left with now, boy
Tell me that I'm all that you need, babe
Longing for my company, hey
You're pushing me 'round
Look at what I'm left with now, boy

[Verse 2]
I can see you kind of need me
You’ve been having trouble sleepin’
Maybe we are meant to be here
Maybe I want us to happen
Sometimes I wish you would leave her
We would never speak again, but
Then there's something ’bout you, boy, yeah
Can't hold myself back from ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Tear me down, you hurt me
Change your mind, want me again
Playin' with my heart in utter boredom
Blind again

[Chorus]
Tell me that I'm all that you need, babe
Longing for my company, hey
You’re pushing me 'round
Look at what I'm left with now, boy
Tell me that I'm all that you need, babe
Longing for my company, hey
You're pushing me 'round
Look at what I'm left with now, boy

[Bridge]
Too late to apologise
Movin' on now, with other guys
Deleted all your messages
You're nothing but lies in my head
Should've never hurt me, boy
Busted your shot
Now I am hurt, ooh love

[Chorus]
Tell me that I'm all that you need, babe (Tell me that I'm all that you need)
Longing for my company, hey
You're pushing me 'round
Look at what I'm left with now, boy
