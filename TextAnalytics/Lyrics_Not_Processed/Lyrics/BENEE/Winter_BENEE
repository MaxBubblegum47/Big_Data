[Verse 1: BENEE]
Zombies tryna sleep
Zombies surround me
I'm out of place, I feel so weak
People starin' at me
I crave the quiet
I love the silence
Wanna be told a bedtime story
Then not wake up in the morning

[Pre-Chorus: BENEE]
Something here doesn't feel right
My skin burns, I start to cry

[Chorus: BENEE]
The winter suits me better (Ah-oh)
The winter suits me better (Uh-oh)

[Verse 2: Mallrat]
Where are you? Call me
Breathe that I was in your dream
Couldn't run and couldn't scream
Start collectin' all my teeth
But I've got bad news, babe
For your news front page
I swear I saw you right there
It wasn't just a nightmare

[Pre-Chorus: Mallrat]
But that's what happens when you find
A creature that was left outside

[Chorus: BENEE]
The winter suits me better (Ah-oh)
The winter suits me better (Uh-oh)
The winter suits me better (Ah-oh)
The winter suits me better (Uh-oh)

[Bridge: BENEE & Mallrat]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

[Chorus: BENEE & Mallrat]
The winter suits me better (Ah-oh)
The winter suits me better (Uh-oh)
The winter suits me better (Ah-oh)
The winter suits me better (Uh-oh)
