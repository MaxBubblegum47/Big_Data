[Verse 1: BENEE]
Feels like someone's watching me
A man is out there in the trees
Think that's the reason I can't sleep
I see him lurking in my dreams
I stand and walk out of my room
Everything 'round me feels so still
I wonder if he'll jump right out
Cover my face and hold me down
Will I see him, will I not?
I bet he has a hiding spot
I can't relax, hear something snap
He must be out there, watch your back
Walkin' through the garden at night
Things out there steal the light
Can't see this man, he's out of sight
But he still remains in my mind
In the night

[Chorus: BENEE]
In the night garden (Hey)
Things are out there creepin' (Da-dum, dum)
They get into my dreams, then (Get into my dreams, then)
Befriend all my demons (Mmm)

[Verse 2: BENEE]
I ask, "Is anybody out there?" (Hello? Hello?)
No reply comes to my ears (To my ears, to my ears)
Mmm, I think must just be a rat or deer (Rat or deer)
Guess now I'll try to sleep
There's no one here (No one's here, no one's here)
Back into my bed I go (Bed I go)
Covers right over my toes (Over my toes)
Pillow goes over my head (My head)
I pray that I won't wake up dead (Wake up dead)
Mmm, feels like someone's watching me (Mmm)
A man is out there in the trees
Think that's the reason I can't sleep
I see him lurking in my dreams

[Chorus: BENEE]
In the night garden (In the night garden, hey)
Things are out there creepin' (Da-dum, dum)
They get into my dreams, then (Get into my dreams then)
Befriend all my demons (Mmm)

[Verse 3: Bakar]
Walk through the garden of Eden
Night time, I need it
With a girl called Eve, she don't really like speakin'
Speedballin', speedin' to the weekend
When it's up, it's stuck, I don't ever need a reason
But she keeps on pree'in'
Look me in my eyes 'cause my looks could be deceivin'
Why you always schemin'?
Put my dreams on a big screen, now I'm leavin'
I can't believe I fell in love with a Dracula
Might have met my match
Took her to the night show and now she's actin' up
I need to pack her up, get her out of here
'Cause I'm on demon time, I got no time to spare, no
I walked in the party at five
She's still tryna kill my whole vibe
But the sun's coming up, that's my kryptonite
I wonder, is she coming back to the crib tonight?
Back here

[Chorus: BENEE]
In the night garden (In the night garden, hey)
Things are out there creepin' (Da-dum, dum)
They get into my dreams, then (Get into my dreams then)
Befriend all my demons (Mmm)

[Outro: BENEE]
"Is anybody out there?" (Shh)
I ask, "Is anybody out there?"
In the night garden
Get into my dreams, then
