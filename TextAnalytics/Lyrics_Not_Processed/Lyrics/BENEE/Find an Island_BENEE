[Chorus]
Find an island far away from me (Hey!)
A shipwreck lost at sea
Where nobody goes, no search party (Hey!)
Nobody knows but me

[Verse 1]
Both shared a single rope
Trying to stay afloat
The treasure that you blew
When I was tied to you
We reeled each other in
Got caught up in the wind
Our sails, they pulled too hard
And we fell off our raft

[Pre-Chorus]
If our own mistakes are too much to take
If this just won't work and we can't find a way
Maybe our maps go different ways, go different ways

[Chorus]
Find an island far away from me (Hey!)
A shipwreck lost at sea
Where nobody goes, no search party (Hey!)
Nobody knows but me
Find an island far away from me (Hey!)
A shipwreck lost at sea
Where nobody goes, no search party (Hey!)
Nobody knows but me

[Post-Chorus]
Find an island
Find an island

[Verse 2]
Slowly you drifted off
Putting us on the rocks
No longer want to know
Where you make plans to go
I built this boat to last
You chose to move too fast
A storm has swept right through
And washed away of you

[Pre-Chorus]
If our own mistakes are too much to take
If this just won't work and we can't find a way
Maybe our maps go different ways, go different ways

[Chorus]
Find an island far away from me (Hey!)
A shipwreck lost at sea
Where nobody goes, no search party (Hey!)
Nobody knows but me
Find an island far away from me (Hey!)
A shipwreck lost at sea
Where nobody goes, no search party (Hey!)
Nobody knows but me

[Post-Chorus]
Find an island
Find an island

[Pre-Chorus]
And if our own mistakes are too much to take
If this just won't work and we can't find a way
Maybe our maps go different ways, go different ways

[Chorus]
Find an island far away from me (Far away from me)
A shipwreck lost at sea (At sea)
Where nobody goes, no search party (Party)
Nobody knows but me
Find an island far away from me (Away from me)
A shipwreck lost at sea (At sea)
Where nobody goes, no search party (Party)
Nobody knows but me
