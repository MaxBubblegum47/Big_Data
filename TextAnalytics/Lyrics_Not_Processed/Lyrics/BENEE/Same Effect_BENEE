[Verse 1]
It's funny, feel you pokin' at my heart
You said that what I say, it makes you laugh
How 'bout you come 'round and pick me up?
We'll joke around and talk 'bout real stuff

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't sell yourself short, uh
There's something about you
Can't explain, but I can't live without you

[Chorus]
Now I want you, I'm sick of bein' alone
Lyin' 'round here, and you're all that I want
The others, they don't have the same effect
Don't wanna be someone who you forget

[Verse 2]
You sent a letter
And I read every word
Nothing feels better
I melted when you called

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't sell yourself short, uh
There's something about you
Can't explain, but I can't live without you

[Chorus]
Now I want you, I'm sick of bein' alone
Lyin' 'round here, and you're all that I want
The others, they don't have the same effect
Don't wanna be someone who you forget

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Now I want you, I'm sick of bein' alone
Lyin' 'round here, and you're all that I want
The others, they don't have the same effect
Don't wanna be someone who you forget

[Outro]
Ooh
