[Verse 1]
I'm tryna fall asleep
Something doesn't feel right
A chill crawls up my skin
A tinglin' down my limbs
A shadow in the night
My God, it gave me such a fright
I see him standing right outside
His face is red, his eyes are white

[Pre-Chorus]
What is it that he wants from me?
Maybe he just feels lonely
What is it that he has in mind?
Why has he come here at this time?

[Chorus]
A monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night
The monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night

[Verse 2]
Wake up in a magic cave
Here's me trying to be brave
But then instead of eatin' me
He offers me a blueberry

[Pre-Chorus]
What is it that he wants from me?
Maybe he just feels lonely
What is it that he has in mind?
Why has he come here at this time?

[Chorus]
The monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night
The monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night

[Bridge]
The monster walks me to a pot
It seems like time is all I got
He puts my head inside, I'm not ready to die
Instead of burning out alive, I see my room, flames rising high
He wasn't tryna hurt me, was only tryna save me

[Chorus]
The monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night
The monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night
