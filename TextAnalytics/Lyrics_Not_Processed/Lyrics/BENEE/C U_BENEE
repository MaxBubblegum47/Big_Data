[Verse 1]
The sand is everywhere it seems
I can't get that stuff off my feet
You say something that makes me laugh
For a second, thought you had my heart
The dewy mist, it cools my lips
Your jumper's good for days like this
I know that we both want it, mmm

[Chorus]
If I could stay, you know I would
I like it here deep in the woods
But we know that it won't last long
It feels so good to have someone

[Post-Chorus]
I'll see you
I'll catch you 'round
I'll see you
I have to be somewhere else

[Verse 2]
Shadow of a tree
Falling of the leaves
So peacefully we lie
Watching stars as they shoot by
As the waves roll out
I stay at your house
You roll your curtains down
Bliss surrounds us now

[Chorus]
If I could stay, you know I would
I likе it here deep in the woods
But wе know that it won't last long
It feels so good to have someone

[Post-Chorus]
I'll see you
I'll catch you 'round
I'll see you
I have to be somewhere else

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Post-Chorus]
I'll see you
I'll catch you 'round
I'll see you
I have to be somewhere else
