[Chorus]
Bad bitch, I am a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a bad bitch
But you can't have this
Cannot have this, no you can't have this
This, no you can't have a bad bitch, bitch
Bad bitch, I am a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a bad bitch
But you can't have this
Cannot have this, no you can't have this
This, no you can't have a bad bitch, bitch

[Chorus]
Bad bitch, I am a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a bad bitch
But you can't have this
Cannot have this, no you can't have this
This, no you can't have a bad bitch, bitch
Bad bitch, I am a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a bad bitch
But you can't have this
Cannot have this, no you can't have this
This, no you can't have a bad bitch, bitch

[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes, darkness, it starts to rise
Like a [?] now, guess that I'll soon find out

[?] 'round your [?] wake up and I showed you
Covered in the bedroom, very
You think that this is over, saw me just be gone
Who stole all your money? No, you better run
Roses like a [bun?], oh, I'm stuck into you, hey

[Chorus]
Bad bitch, I am a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a bad bitch
But you can't have this
Cannot havе this, no you can't have this
This, no you can't have a bad bitch, bitch
Bad bitch, I am a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a bad bitch
But you can't have this
Cannot havе this, no you can't have this
This, no you can't have a bad bitch, bitch

[Verse 2]
Lights are flashin' at me
Make them blue so pretty
But they cannot catch me
But they cannot catch me
Lights are flashin' at me
Make them blue so pretty
But they cannot catch me
'Cause I am too speedy

[Verse 3]
Open up your eyes, darkness, it starts to rise
Like a [?] now, guess that I'll soon find out

[?] 'round your [?] wake up and I showed you
Covered in the bedroom, very
You think that this is over, saw me just be gone
Who stole all your money? No, you better run
Roses like a [bun?], oh, I'm stuck into you, hey

[Verse 4]
Cover all my tattoos, I'll cover my tattoos for you
Cover my tattoos, I'll cover my tattoos for you
Hey, does it make you sad when I talk about you like that?
Babe, does it make you sad when I talk about you like that?
Hey, does it make you sad when I talk about you like that?
And, babe, does it make you sad when I talk about you like that?

[Verse 5]
Setting my alarm, I really do not care
My heart is fallin' apart and so is my hair

[When?] you light it, light it for me

[?]
Setting my alarm, I really do not care
My heart is fallin' apart and so is my hair

[When?] you light it, light it for me

[?]

[Chorus]
Bad bitch, I am a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a bad bitch
But you can't have this
Cannot have this, no you can't have this
This, no you can't have a bad bitch, bitch
Bad bitch, I am a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a bad bitch
But you can't have this
Cannot have this, no you can't have this
This, no you can't have a bad bitch, bitch
