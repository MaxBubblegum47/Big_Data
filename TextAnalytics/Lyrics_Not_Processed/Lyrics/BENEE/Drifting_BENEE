[Verse 1: BENEE]
I'm on a rollercoaster on a mission to the stars
An adventure they encounter, on a journey to Mars
Spacegirl lookin' at me, she has a silver heart
Robo boy not far from her, body with no bones
She takes a sip of a magic potion, and her hair starts to explode
Has he poisoned her, I wonder?
Will she fall for him, he hopes
She turns into a flower, robo boy left blind
He asks her if she feels alright

[Chorus: BENEE]
Space, we're all driftin' through space
Space, we're all driftin' through space
And finding our way
Finding our way

[Verse 2: Jack Berry]
Looks around the corner, but Pluto's where I lie
Looking out to the skies, hopin' she'll arrive
My body's made of metal, but my heart's of human kind
Foolish, I see the light, she won't come down tonight
She wanna know me, she wanna know me
But I'm a different type
She wanna see me, she wanna see me
But I refuse to fly
Hope for the best, here I rest, she knows that I'll be fine
(Hope I've got time)

[Chorus: BENEE]
Space, we're all driftin' through space
Space, we're all driftin' through space
Finding my way
Space, we're all driftin' through space
Space, we're all driftin' through space
Finding our way

[Outro: BENEE & Jack Berry]
Finding our way
Finding our way
Finding our way
Finding our way
