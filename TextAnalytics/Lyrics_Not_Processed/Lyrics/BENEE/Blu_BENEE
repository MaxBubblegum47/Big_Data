[Intro]
Mm-mm

[Verse 1]
Don't look pretty when I cry
Do you feel bad when you lie?
You weren't helping me, no
You'd make me feel so small
When I lost you
Nothing was good
No longer happy anymore
Had to let it go

[Chorus]
Ooh, I thought I found the one
But clearly, I was blue (Babe)
Blue

[Verse 2]
Why would I stay?
You forced me away
You were nice, 'til you were not
We always fought
Fought a lot
I wonder why you took so long
To realise that the love was gone
Never, ever felt so bad

[Chorus]
Ooh, I thought I found the one
But clearly, I was blue (Babe)
Blue

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Mm-mm-mm
Ooh
