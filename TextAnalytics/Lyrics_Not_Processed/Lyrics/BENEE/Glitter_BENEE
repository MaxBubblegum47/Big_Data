[Verse 1]
Everyone else has left now
I bet that this got you stressed out
Wonderin', what can we do now?
Maybe let it burn out
Where I can’t feel my face
Mm, minds twisted in weird ways
Wonderin', what can we do now?
Maybe let it burn out

[Pre-Chorus]
Glitter's sparklin’ on your heart now, darling
Won't you stay?
I'm here wonderin' what to say
You're putting me away now

[Chorus]
I know it's getting late now, baby
Maybe you should stay here with me
Let's just make it our own party
Stick together like glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter

[Verse 2]
Race against the sunlight
Wanna have a long night
Night mysteries, night mysteries
Under spotlight, don't let me out of your sight
Two energies, two energies

[Pre-Chorus]
Glitter’s sparklin’ on your heart now, darling
Won't you stay? (Ooh)
I’m here wonderin' what to say
You're putting me away now

[Chorus]
I know it's getting late now, baby
Maybe you should stay here with me
Let’s just make it our own party
Stick together like glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter
I know it's getting late now, baby (Late now)
Maybe you should stay here with me
Let's just make it our own party (Party)
Stick together like glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter

[Outro]
Everyone else has left now
I bet that this got you stressed out
Wonderin', what can we do now?
Maybe let it burn out
