[Verse 1]
I saw you from afar
Asked if I wanted some of your cigar
But I don't smoke
I think you wanna know me
Drivin' inside your car
You put your hand around my heart
But I'm afraid, yeah
You'll try to control me

[Chorus]
And if I stay a little while
How long will you make me wait your call?
Make it warmer for me, yeah
'Cause I'm cold

[Post-Chorus]
I try so hard to talk to you
But I stay quiet
'Cause I'm confused
I'm not used to guys like you
I'm so used to being used

[Verse 2]
You think that I'm bizarre, I wanna know just who you are
And what you're like, yeah
What you're like inside, oh
You say I'm not the same as all the girls you used to date
And this time, oh
You wanna really try

[Chorus]
And if I stay a little whilе
How long will you make me wait your call?
Make it warmеr for me, yeah
'Cause I'm cold

[Post-Chorus]
I try so hard to talk to you
But I stay quiet
'Cause I'm confused
I'm not used to guys like you
I'm so used to being used
