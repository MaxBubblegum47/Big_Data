[Verse 1: BENEE]
Yeah, it's kinda strange how you like me
You don't have to change, keep it high-key
Everythin' you say is the right thing
But you text me every day and I can't keep

[Pre-Chorus: BENEE]
Actin' like I feel the same, sheesh
I don't know what to say, you're so sweet
I don't know what to say, but you're so sweet
I don't know what to say, but you're so sweet

[Chorus: BENEE]
Everythin' you say is the right thing
But you text me every day and I can't keep
Actin' like I feel the same, sheesh
I don't know what to say, but you're so sweet
Yeah, you're so sweet, yeah, you're so sweet, babe
Yeah, you're so sweet, yeah, you're so sweet, babe
You don't have to change, keep it high-key
Yeah, it's kinda strange how you like me

[Verse 2: BENEE]
Driving 'round in your BMW
Driving 'round in your BMW
By the looks, lots of girls want a piece of you
Mr. Nice Guy, it seems that I should want you

[Pre-Chorus: BENEE]
But I'm stupid and I fall for other dudes
But I'm stupid and I fall for other dudes
But I'm stupid and I fall for other dudes

[Chorus: BENEE]
Every-every-every-everythin' you says the right thing
But you text me every day and I can't keep
Actin' like I feel the same, sheesh
I don't know what to say, but you're so sweet
Yeah you're so sweet, yeah you're so sweet, babe
Yeah you're so sweet, yeah you're so sweet, babe
You don't have to change, keep it high-key
Yeah, it's kinda strange how you like me

[Bridge: Grimes]
Follow the white rabbit, huh
Into the belly of the underworld
Here you stand, I don't know why
All or nothing, live or die
We ride east until dawn
To the heart of the song
I'm alive
May I have what I desire
And I shall be satisfied

[Chorus: BENEE]
Everythin' you say is the right thing
But you text me every day and I can't keep
Actin' like I feel the same, sheesh
I don't know what to say, but you're so sweet
Yeah, you're so sweet, yeah, you're so sweet, babe
Yeah, you're so sweet, yeah, you're so sweet, babe
You don't have to change, keep it high-key
Yeah, it's kinda strange how you like me

[Outro: Grimes]
I get what I desire and I get what I want
I get what I desire and I get what I want
I get what I desire and I get what I want
I get what I desire and I get what I want
Oh, what I want, I get what I want
