[Verse 1: BENEE]
You and your friends watching me
Knowing I'm better than you'll ever be
I liked a picture of you and your missus
It's cool to see you're out there getting bitches
Funny how sometimes you'd try hitting me up
Clearly your new girl, she is just is not enough
Seems you've finally found a replacement
Bet when she's in your bed she fakes it

[Chorus: BENEE]
What a shame, your girl's so plain
She's got nothing on me
Hope she stays the hell away
I don't wanna see her
What a shame, your girl's so plain
She's got nothing on me
Hope she stays the hell away
I don't wanna see her

[Post-Chorus: Lily Allen]
You went out with that?
Oh, that makes me real sad
You went out with that?
Oh, that makes me real sad
You went out with that?
Oh, that makes me real sad
You went out with that?
Oh, that makes me real sad

[Verse 2: Lily Allen]
I was dumb to give you my love
We had some fun, but it was never enough
You've got these traits and they're just so unappealing
I should have left when I first had that feeling
Back when we met, I was a terrible mess (Terrible mess)
I'm just surprised at how you've not been Me Too'd yet (Me Too'd yet)
Maybe you're not ready for this conversation
That's why I'm out of the equation

[Chorus: BENEE & 
Flo Mili
]
What a shame, your girl's so plain
She's got nothing on me
Hope she stays the hell away
I don't wanna see her
What a shame, your girl's so plain
She's got nothing on me
Hope she stays the hell away
I don't wanna see her
(
That bitch ain't got nothin' on me
)

[Bridge: Flo Milli]
Oh, you into them plain Janes now?
Lookin' like your standards went way down (Way down)
Showing her off, she ain't even all that
I guess you like your new bitches lame now (Lame now)
They be watching me like television
I hope these bitches don't think they competition (Oh)
Niggas actin' different, I'ma lose my interest
I got everything that lil' ho missin'
She can't fuck with my dips and my curves (Ha-ha)
Hope she don't think that she fly, she a bird (Curve)
You gon' learn, I'm the ex you ain't deserve
Still in my DMs, boy you got some nerve, so absurd
Whatchu smokin' thinkin' I'm replaceable?
Moved onto better, I should be thankin' you (You can)
Burstin' bubbles everytime I'm poppin' shit
I upgraded and you did the opposite (
Flo Milli shit
)

[Chorus: BENEE & 
Flo Mili
]
What a shame, your girl's so plain
She's got nothing on me (
That bitch ain't got nothin' on me
)
Hope she stays the hell away
I don't wanna see her
What a shame, your girl's so plain
She's got nothing on me (
That bitch ain't got nothin' on me
)
Hope she stays the hell away
I don't wanna see her

[Post-Chorus: Lily Allen]
You went out with that?
Oh, that makes me real sad
You went out with that?
Oh, that makes me real sad
You went out with that?
Oh, that makes me real sad
You went out with that?
Oh, that makes me real sad
