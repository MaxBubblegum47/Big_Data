[Verse 1: BENEE]
My mind explodes, my body starts to feel controlled
I lose a hold, this place it starts to turn so cold
Lungs wrap from within, I cannot hear anything
You're sayin' somethin', I can see that your mouth's movin'

[Pre-Chorus: BENEE]
Your eyes are red, I can see you're knocked out too
What is this room? I can't take my eyes off you

[Chorus: BENEE]
Spaced out all the time
I'm fallin' behind
I'm spaced out all the time

[Verse 2: Muroki]
I've had too much, can feel my body 'bout to give up
What is this stuff? I think that we stuffed it up

[Pre-Chorus: BENEE & Muroki]
Your eyes are red, I can see you're knocked out too
What is this room? I can't take my eyes off you

[Chorus: Muroki, 
BENEE
 & 
Both
]
Spaced out all the time (Time, yeah)
I'm fallin' behind (
Fallin', fallin'
)
Spaced out all the time
 (
Spaced out all the time
)
I'm fallin' behind
Spaced out all the time
