[Verse 1]
Hope I don't die inside a plane
I'd like to die a better way
And if I live to an old age
I would have seen everything change

[Pre-Chorus]
I understand why people leave
But leaving seems scary to me

[Chorus]
I think about these things too much
My mind likes to wind itself up
And I don't get a lot of sleep
'Cause what if they happen to me?

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause what if they happen to me?
Yeah, what if they happen to me?

[Verse 2]
What if my room burns down in flames?
And I die in my sleep
And never wake

[Pre-Chorus]
You say I shouldn't be this way
But I don't think that I can change

[Chorus]
I think about these things too much
My mind likes to wind itself up
And I don't get a lot of sleep
'Cause what if they happen to me?

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause what if they happen to me?
Yeah, what if they happen to me?

[Chorus]
I think about these things too much
My mind likes to wind itself up
And I don't get a lot of sleep
'Cause what if they happen to me?
