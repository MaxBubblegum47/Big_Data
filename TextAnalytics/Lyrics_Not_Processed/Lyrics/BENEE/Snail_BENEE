[Verse 1]
Wonder why you stay inside
I can't talk, can't speak my mind
Why you wanna waste your time?
Why don't you join me outside?
Everything is good, everything is fine
Thought I'd let you know, having a great time
Wonder why you stay inside
I can't talk, can't speak my mind

[Chorus]
I'm like a snail, you're a guy
Kinda mad I can't fly
When it's day, hide away
But come out when it rains
Like a snail, you're a guy
Kinda mad I can't fly
When it's day, hide away
But come out when it rains, when it rains

[Post-Chorus]
When it rains
(When it rains)
(When it rains)
(When it rains)

[Verse 2]
As I wake, down goes day
Out comes night, look alive
And I'll meet you in the park
The moon will light up my path
Everything's passing by
I ride to you on my bike
While everyone is asleep
Meet at the top of your street

[Chorus]
I'm like a snail, you're a guy
Kinda mad I can't fly
When it's day, hide away
But come out when it rains
Like a snail, you're a guy
Kinda mad I can't fly
When it's day, hide away
But come out when it rains, when it rains

[Post-Chorus]
When it rains
(When it rains)
(When it rains)
(When it rains)

[Bridge]
Snail
(When it rains)
(When it rains)
(When it rains)

[Chorus]
I'm like a snail, you're a guy
Kinda mad I can't fly
When it's day, hide away
But come out when it rains
Like a snail, you're a guy
Kinda mad I can't fly
When it's day, hide away
But come out when it rains, when it rains
