[Intro]
Listen, ya

[Chorus]
I hope you listen closely
Girl, don't act like you still know me
Telling lies to all your friends
You know the truth is what you owe, owe me
Owe me, you owe me, ya
Ya, ya, ya ya ya
Oh ya, oh ya
Ooh

[Verse]
I'm taking longer than ever cuz I love writing new stuff
I'm complicated communication are setting me up
I'm up and coming, I'll never stop why they giving it up
I fell in love with the plan, I'm never making it up
I got the second page of money that I found in my bank stashed
I'm halfway full my heart racing it's that bad
I wanna know, I'll take you where you wanna go
Just follow the noise and we can start up a show

[Bridge]
Listen, ya
Oh
Listen, ya
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You gon' hit me when I'm thru
What's new, what's new?
Pylon, pylon
Why you, why you?
You gon' hit me when I'm thru
What's new, what's new?
Pylon, pylon
Why you, why you?
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
I hope you listen closely
Girl, don't act like you still know me
Telling lies to all your friends
You know the truth is what you owe, owe me
Owe me, you owe me, ya
Ya, ya, ya ya ya

[Bridge]
Listen, ya
Oh
Listen, ya
Oh

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Listen
I hope you listen closely
Girl, don't act like you still know me
Telling lies to all your friends
You know the truth is what you owe, owe me
Owe me, you owe me, ya
Ya, ya, ya ya ya
