[Hook]
Stuck in a daze, I feel like I'm riding a wave
My life is a roller coaster inside of a maze
I hope it's a phase, spending way more than I save
I don't know if I'm matching my age anymore, man, I need to break out of this cage
Stuck in a daze, I feel like I'm riding a wave
My life is a roller coaster inside of a maze
I hope it's a phase, I hope it's a, hope it's a phase
I feel like I'm riding a wave (tsunami)
Jump!

[Verse]
Get on my level, you killing my vibe? Need to get on my level
Tryna be special, I be loving the rush of the blood in my vessels
I feel like a rebel: I've got silver and gold, I don't need me a medal
Wild for the night and I don't wanna settle, driving as fast as my foot on the pedal

[Hook]
Stuck in a daze, I feel like I'm riding a wave
My life is a roller coaster inside of a maze
I hope it's a phase, spending way more than I save
I don't know if I'm matching my age anymore, man, I need to break out of this cage (tsunami)
Jump!

[Bridge]
Get on my level, you killing my vibe? Need to get on my level
I feel like a rebel, I feel like a, feel like a, feel like a rebel

[Hook]
Stuck in a daze, I feel like I'm riding a wave
My life is a roller coaster inside of a maze
I hope it's a phase, I hope it's a, hope it's a phase
I feel like I'm riding a wave (tsunami)
Yeah
