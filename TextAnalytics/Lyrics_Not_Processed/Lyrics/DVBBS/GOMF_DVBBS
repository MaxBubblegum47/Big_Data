[Verse 1]
So you wanna live long, so you wanna be free?
Baby, running out of time, that's a really bad beat
I mean, she wanna play hard to get, that’s fine by me
By me, but I never wait long, I move on to what I need

[Chorus]
I get my way, get out my way, yeah
Switch my plates, I'm on my way, yeah
No mistakes, I know the stakes, ye-yeah
I don't show face, I keep my pace, yeah
I don’t show face, I keep my pace, yeah
I get my way, get out my way, yeah
I don't show face, I keep my pace, yeah
I get my way, get out my way, yeah
I get my way, get out my way, yeah
I get my way, get out my way, yeah, yeah
She on my waist, she on my waist, yeah, yeah
I get my way, get out my way

[Verse 2]
Gold crown while I'm down on my knees
That's me, I don't talk down I just move how I need
Ole, hit it one time now she going both ways
You know who's in control
All that bullshit gets hold of you, oh

[Chorus]
I get my way, get out my way, yeah
Switch my plates, I'm on my way, yeah

[Chorus]
Coming into my life
You know, nana
Two drinks and I’m low, babe, I’m all for that
Don't leave when I’m on, you know you wrong for that
At least when I'm home, you no longer there
Yeah, you my demon, you no longer there

[Chorus]
I get my way, get out my way, yeah
I get my way, get out my way, yeah
She on my waist, she on my waist, yeah, yeah
I get it my way, get out my way, yeah
