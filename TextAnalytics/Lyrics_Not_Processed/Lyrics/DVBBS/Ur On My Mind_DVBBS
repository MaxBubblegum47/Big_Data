[Break]
I sold my soul for a trip with you
Let you control all the things I do
I give in to your impression to love sometimes
Let you control all the things I do

[Build Up]
I hear them voices, you hear me calling
You're on my mind, you're on my mind
I hear them voices, you hear me calling
You're on my mind, you're on my mind

I sold my soul for a trip with you (you x4)

[Drop]

I sold my soul for a trip with you

[Break]
I sold my soul for a trip with you
Let you control all the things I do
I give in to your impression to love sometimes
Let you control all the things I do

[Build Up]
I hear them voices, you hear me calling
You're on my mind, you're on my mind
I hear them voices, you hear me calling
You're on my mind, you're on my mind

(You're on my mind x6)

I sold my soul for a trip with you (you x4)
