[Intro: Diddy]
It’s like shit is coming down from the motherfuckin’ heavens
It’s a new motherfuckin’ day
Get down or lay down
Ay yo, turn the fuck up
Ay yo, fuck sparklers
I wanna see flamethrowers in this motherfucker
This a will.i.am joint
Hit-Boy, Britney, Waka, Weezy
And they call me Diddy bitch

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Where 1 Oak at? Where Darby at?
If you at Greystone gettin’ your drink on, tell ‘em to run this back
Put your hands up in the air, got the call from will.i.am
Now it’s Hit-Boy on a hit boy
You turned up and I’mma bring the action

[Bridge: Britney Spears & (Diddy)]
When you hear this in the club
You’re gonna turn-turn it up (turn up bitch)
You’re gonna turn-turn it up (turn up bitch)
You’re gonna turn-turn it up (turn up bitch!)
When we up in the club, all eyes on us (turn up bitch)
All eyes on us (turn up) all eyes on us (let’s rock)
See the boys in the club, they watching us
They watching us (you watching us) They watching us
Everybody in the club, all eyes on us
All eyes on us (you watching us) all eyes on us

[Chorus: will.i.am & Britney Spears]
I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying: “oh wee, oh wee, oh wee, oh”
We saying: “oh wee, oh wee, oh wee, oh”
I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying: “oh wee, oh wee, oh wee, oh”
You are now, now rocking with
Will.i.am and Britney bitch

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
It’s rock and roll, roll
Whole world know my shit everywhere I go
Whole world bang this song ‘cause it’s cold
Ah, shit, I think that girl ready to go off
But she want a photo – so I took a photo
Yeah, I took a picture with a I.Am Foto Sosho
Yeah, you got a cold chick, but I got a colder ho
But, she don’t really know shit, so I gotta show the ho
Hide your paper, yeah I’m stackin’ paper
Money to the ceiling, now I need a skyscraper
You are now, now rockin’ with, will.i.am and Britney, bitch
Waka Flocka Flame, Lil’ Wayne, Hit-Boy, Diddy, bitch

[Bridge: will.i.am]
When you hear this in the club, just put your hands up
Just put your hands up, just put your hands up
When we up in the club…

[Interlude: Diddy]
Motherfuckers I said put your hands up!
Turn the fuck up right motherfuckin’ now!

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka!
Oh, it’s time to party, oh, it’s time to party
Smokin’, drinkin’, no passin’ out
YOLO, I’mma shout it out, we party hard, we yell it out
Disrespect me, knock him out, crack a smile, Pacquiao
Fuck the VIP, I’m in the crowd, me and Britney, we actin’ wild
It’s Waka Flame, you know my style, this little chain like 40 thou
All eyes on me, thugged out, pop a bean, that’s the old me
Molly’s here, we don’t fight fair, my buzz big, like Lightyear
You ain't real, shorty, you can’t stand here
Friends, fans and family here
Outfit real, live with no fear, turn the club into a mosh pit
Spend 20 bands, do a backflip, girl, drop it low, shake that
My wrists rocky like A$AP, this a G mix and I laced that! FLOCKA!

[Bridge: Britney Spears & (Diddy)]
When you hear this in the club
You’re gonna turn-turn it up (turn up bitch)
You’re gonna turn-turn it up (turn up bitch)
You’re gonna turn-turn it up (turn up bitch!)
When we up in the club, all eyes on us
All eyes on us, all eyes on us

[Chorus: will.i.am & Britney Spears]
I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying: “oh wee, oh wee, oh wee, oh”
You are now, now rocking with will.i.am and Britney bitch

[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]
Hi! I’m Tunechi – I give the girls my room key
Money can’t buy you love, so I don’t pay for no pussy
I don’t pay these haters no mind – so fuckin’ call me cheap
I grab life by the horns, and that bitch went “beep-beep”
I swear right now I feel like Pac – ‘cause all eyes on me
And I don’t mean to throw no salt but these niggas small fries to me
And my bitch bad like Britney, but I wish I had Britney
She remind me of my Jeep, but I got a bad memory
And I’m feelin’ good, I’m lookin’ good, I’m smokin’ good, I’m sippin’
These hoes think they classy? Well that’s the class I’m skippin’
Got a party in my bedroom, that’s a party she ain’t missin’
I brought her by will.i.am, but she kept callin’ him William
Only God can judge me, case closed
I got more hoes than Drake shows
I got this shit on lock, no escape doors
And I’ll make that bitch scream, and shout, and let it all out
I’ll put it in her backyard like a fuckin’ doghouse – Tunechi!

[Chorus: will.i.am, Britney Spears & (Lil' Wayne)]
Scream and shout, and let it all out (yeah, yeah)
And scream and shout, and let it out (yeah)
We saying: “oh wee, oh wee, oh wee, oh”
We saying: “oh wee, oh wee, oh wee, oh”
I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying: “oh wee, oh wee, oh wee, oh”
You are now, now rocking with
Will.i.am and Britney bitch

[Outro: Diddy]
Let’s go
This is the remix
This is a super black man remix
This is the remix
This is a super black man remix
This is a super black man remix
Yeah
And they call me Diddy bitch
Yeah, scream and shout
And turn them all out, yeah
