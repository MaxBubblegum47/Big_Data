[Intro]
You wanna?
You wanna?

[Chorus]
You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti?
You want a Maserati? You better work bitch
You want a Lamborghini? Sip martinis?
Look hot in a bikini? You better work bitch
You wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion?
Party in France?
You better work bitch, you better work bitch
You better work bitch, you better work bitch
Now get to work bitch!
Now get to work bitch!

[Verse 1]
Bring it on, ring the alarm
Don't stop now, just be the champion
Work it hard, like it's your profession
Watch out now, cause here it comes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Here comes the smasher, here comes the master
Here comes the big beat, big beat to blast ya'
No time to quit now, just time to get it now
Pick up what I'm puttin' down, pick up what I'm puttin' down

[Chorus]
You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti?
You want a Maserati? You better work bitch
You want a Lamborghini? Sip martinis?
Look hot in a bikini? You better work bitch
You wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion?
Party in France?
You better work bitch, you better work bitch
You better work bitch, you better work bitch
Now get to work bitch!
Now get to work bitch!

[Verse 2]
Break it up, break it down
See me comin' you can hear my sound
Tell somebody in your town
Spread the word, spread the word

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Go call the police, go call the governor
I bring the treble, don't mean to trouble ya'
I make it bubble up, call me the bubbler
I am the bad bitch, the bitch that you're lovin' up

[Bridge]
Hold your head high, fingers to the sky
They gon' try and try ya', but they can't deny ya'
Keep it moving higher, and higher
Keep it moving higher, and higher
So hold your head high, fingers to the sky
Now they don't believe ya', but they gonna need ya'
Keep it moving higher and higher
Keep it moving higher and higher and higher

[Outro]
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out
You better work bitch
You better work bitch
