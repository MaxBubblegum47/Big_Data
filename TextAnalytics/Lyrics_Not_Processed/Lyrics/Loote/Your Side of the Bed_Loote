[Verse 1: Emma Lov Block]
Hope you never hear this
You probably can't deal with it
Hope your family's still doing great
I'm miss 'em every Sunday
Friends probably hate me
Wish you'd never met me
Fuck a happy ending

[Pre-Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
Since you left it's one, two, three
Now he's coming in close to me
I can't sleep 'cause he's where you're supposed to be at
He's getting all the songs you used to get
He's getting all of the words inside of my head
He's sleeping on your side of the bed
But it's still your side, now I'm up all night

[Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed
I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed

[Verse 2: Emma Lov Block]
Nights with your old friends
Thank god you've got 'em
Everyone says that you're better off
No, you don't believe 'em
Staying at the bar till 2
Then you stumble home all alone
While I check my phone

[Pre-Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
'Cause since you left it's one, two, three
Now he's coming in close to me
I can't sleep 'cause he's where you're supposed to be at
He's getting all the songs you used to get
He's getting all of the words inside of my head
He's sleeping on your side of the bed
But it's still your side, now I'm up all night

[Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed
I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed

[Bridge: Emma Lov Block]
One, two, three
Whoa, I can't sleep
He said
He's getting all the songs you used to get
He's getting all of the words inside of my head
He's sleeping on your side of the bed
But it's still your side, now I'm up all night

[Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed
I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed
(He's taking your side, your side of the bed)

I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed (Your side of the bed)
I got me someone else instead
He's taking your side of the bed
(He's taking your side, your side of the bed)
