[Verse 1: Emma Lov Block]
I'm feeling foolish just because
You've been fooling with someone
Who isn't who they used to be
Someone who isn't me

[Pre-Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
Who's bad idea was this anyway?
Said that we needed space, we just got closer
Late at night, missing the little things
Something as simple as, "Baby, come over"
But I can't forget the way you taste

[Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
So I pour another shot
And I pretend that it's your lips
Chase you down, another round
Until I taste your whiskey kiss
When you're up at 2 AM
You know that I'll be up in 5
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
Let me be your tomorrow tonight

[Verse 2: Emma Lov Block]
I'm feeling foolish thinking 'bout
All the nights that you go out
And the reason I can't do the same
I'm scared I'll call someone your name

[Pre-Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
Who's bad idea was this
Trying to fix something that wasn't broken?
Late at night, missing the little things
Something as simple as, "Baby, come hold me"
But I can't forget the way you taste

[Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
So I pour another shot
And I pretend that it's your lips
Chase you down, another round
Until I taste your whiskey kiss
When you're up at 2 AM
You know that I'll be up in 5
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
Let me be your tomorrow tonight

[Post-Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
Your tomorrow, your tomorrow
Let me be your tomorrow tonight

[Bridge: Emma Lov Block]
So I pour another shot
And I pretend that it's your lips
Chase you down, another round
Until I taste your whiskey kiss
When you're up and you can't sleep
Because you're still thinking of me
Let me be your tomorrow tonight

[Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
So I pour another shot
And I pretend that it's your lips
Chase you down, another round
Until I taste your whiskey kiss
When you're up at 2 AM
You know that I'll be up in 5
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
