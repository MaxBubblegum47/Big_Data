[Verse 1]
I had this nightmare
You woke up one morning and changed your mind
I have irrational fears we've talked over a hundred times
I love you carefully, cautious of how deeply I dive
Though I know you mean it
It’s hard to believe that you're on my side

[Pre-Chorus]
So drive slow when I'm sitting shotgun
Dive slow into new things
There’s pain that I've learned a lot from
I'll help you if you help me
I get so caught in the moment
And I jump ahead of myself
When you say you can't see yourself with anyone else

[Chorus]
Are you sure? Are you sure?
'Cause I don't want to let you down
It's my heart, it's my heart
’Cause we’re so high off the ground
So drive slow when I'm sitting shotgun
Dive slow into new things
There’s pain that I've learned a lot from
I'll help you if you help me
So drive slow when I'm sitting shotgun
Dive slow into new things
There’s pain that I've learned a lot from
I'll help you if you help me

[Verse 2]
I'm wide awake and you're still here in the morning
You're asleep, oh
I have irrational fears we've fought about on repeat
'Cause I'm not used to people saying what they mean
It's all I want, so don't give up on me, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Just drive slow when I'm sitting shotgun
Dive slow into new things
There's pain that I've learned a lot from
I'll help you if you help me
I get so caught in the moment
And I jump ahead of myself
When you say you can't see yourself with anyone else

[Chorus]
Are you sure? Are you sure?
'Cause I don't want to let you down
It's my heart, it's my heart
'Cause we're so high off the ground
So drive slow when I'm sitting shotgun
Dive slow into new things
There's pain that I've learned a lot from
I'll help you if you help me (Are you sure? Are you sure?)
So drive slow when I'm sitting shotgun
Dive slow into new things
There's pain that I've learned a lot from
I'll help you if you'll help me (I don't want to let you drown)

[Post-Chorus]
Drive slow when I'm sitting shotgun
(I don't want to let you down)
Dive slow into new things
(It's my heart, my heart)
Drive slow when I'm sitting shotgun
('Cause we're so high off the ground)
Dive slow into new things
It's my heart, it's my heart
'Cause we're so high off the ground

[Outro]
I had this nightmare
You woke up one morning and changed your mind
But my love is blind
Are you sure?
