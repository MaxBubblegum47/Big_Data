[Verse 1: Jackson]
I was fine till the night that your friends
Introduced me to you, fucked me up
We got high at the bar now the bar's too high
Girl, on the night we met in the city
I should've just got drunk and stayed home
But now I got a piece of you with me wherever I go
I'm still alone

[Chorus: Jackson]
Thinking oh-na-na, eh-na-na
Dammit, I wish I never met you
Oh-na-na, eh-na-na
Dammit, I tried, I can't forget you
Never knew what I was missing
Till I had you, then I didn't
Oh-na-na, eh-na-na
Dammit, I wish I never, never met you

[Post-Chorus: Jackson]
Dammit I wish I never, never met you
Dammit I try but I can't forget you
Dammit I wish I never, never met you
Dammit I try but I can't forget you

[Verse 2: Jackson]
I've been lying awake and a ghost
In my brain won't let me shake it
I keep on running into your girlfriends
And they knew me back, back
Back to the night we met in the city
I should've just got drunk and stayed home
But now I got a piece of you with me wherever I go
I'm still alone

[Chorus: Jackson]
Thinking oh-na-na, eh-na-na
Dammit, I wish I never met you
Oh-na-na, eh-na-na
Dammit, I tried, I can't forget you
Never knew what I was missing
Till I had you, then I didn't
Oh-na-na, eh-na-na
Dammit, I wish I never, never met you

[Post-Chorus: Jackson]
Dammit I wish I never, never met you
Dammit I try but I can't forget you
Dammit I wish I never, never met you
Dammit I try but I can't forget you

[Bridge: Jackson]
Girl, on the night we met in the city
I should've just stayed home, nah
Got a piece of you with me wherever I go, yeah

[Chorus: Jackson]
Thinking oh-na-na, eh-na-na
Dammit, I wish I never met you
Oh-na-na, eh-na-na
Dammit, I tried, I can't forget you
Never knew what I was missing
Till I had you, then I didn't
Oh-na-na, eh-na-na
Dammit, I wish I never, never met you

[Outro: Jackson]
Dammit, I wish I never, never met you
Dammit, I tried but I can't forget you
Girl, on the night we met in the city
I should've just got drunk and stayed home
But now I got a piece of you with me wherever I go
I'm still alone
