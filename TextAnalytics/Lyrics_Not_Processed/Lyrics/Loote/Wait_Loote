[Verse 1: Emma Lov Block]
When times are hard, feels out of place
Our fading love takes us back to yesterday
The bed is cold from our mistakes
Seat's so empty though we never liked the space

[Pre-Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
Woke up home half drunk
Got a feeling we ain't done
'Cause anywhere you run
No one's gonna know you better
'Cause I was your first one
Back when we were so young
Oh, you can go and have your fun
I know we still wake up together

[Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
Yeah, I'll stay
I'll hold you, every day
Every day I'll wait, I'll stay
I told you and every day
Every day I'll wait

[Drop]
Every day I'll wait
Every day I'll wait
Every day I'll wait
Every day I'll wait
Every day, every day I'll wait

[Verse 2: Emma Lov Block]
We're trapped inside these paper walls
Side by side, stick together when we're apart
All these years, the high and lows
All we know is us, now we can't let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
Woke up home half drunk
Got a feeling we ain't done
'Cause anywhere you run
No one's gonna know you better
'Cause I was your first one
Back when we were so young
Oh, you can go and have your fun
I know we still wake up together

[Chorus: Emma Lov Block]
Yeah, I'll stay
I'll hold you, every day
Every day I'll wait, I'll stay
I told you and every day
Every day I'll wait

[Drop]
Every day I'll wait
Every day, every day I'll wait
Every day, every day I'll wait
Every day I'll wait
Every day, every day I'll wait
Every day I'll wait
Every day, every day I'll wait
