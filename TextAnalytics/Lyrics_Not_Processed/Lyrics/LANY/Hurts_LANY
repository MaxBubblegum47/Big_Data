[Verse 1]
Here I am again, back to my old ways
Frozen with my thoughts
Wasting all my younger days
And I just can't decide, should I be alone?
Hate the way I am, up every night, glued to my phone

[Chorus]
Please tell me why it's easy at first
But then it all breaks
The more you love, the more it hurts
And I was just fine if it didn't work
But now that you're mine
The more I love, the more it hurts, oh

[Verse 2]
Honestly, it's me, I am so messed up
Making all the ones who care about me wanna run
The sunset's black and white, it didn't used to be
I remember when it was pink skies, just you and me

[Chorus]
Please tell me why it's easy at first
But then it all breaks
The more you love, the more it hurts
And I was just fine if it didn't work
But now that you're mine
The more I love, the more it hurts, oh
Ye-eah, oh oh
The more you love, the more it hurts

[Bridge]
I can't help myself
You're the one I want
It might be bad right now
But losing you would really suck

[Chorus]
Please tell me why it's easy at first
But then it all breaks
The more you love, the more it hurts
And I was just fine if it didn't work
But now that you're mine
The more I love, the more it hurts, oh
Ye-eah, oh oh
The more you love, the more it hurts
Ye-eah, oh oh
The more I love, the more it hurts, oh
