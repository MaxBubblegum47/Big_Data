[Verse 1]
It could change, but this feels like, like the calm before the storm
Not that I don't wanna try, but I've been here before
Friends in town, phone's at home, I tell myself it's fine
Can't remember how you taste, slept alone too many nights

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?

[Verse 2]
Half my clothes are at your house, and I don't want them back
The smell of you is way too much, not gonna put my heart through that
I don't know how much time we got, I don't know how much to say
I don't know, tell me what you want, I want you to want me to stay

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?

[Bridge]
La la la la la la la
La la la la oh yeah
La la la la la la la
Ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?
