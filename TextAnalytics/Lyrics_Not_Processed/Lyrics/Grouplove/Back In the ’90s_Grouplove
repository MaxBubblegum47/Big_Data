[Bridge]
Back in the '90s, I was in a very famous TV show (Ooh)
I'm BoJack the Horse (BoJack!), BoJack the Horse
Don't act like you don't know

[Verse]
And I'm trying to hold on to my past
It's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last
I guess I'll just try
And make you understand
That I'm more horse than a man
Or I'm more man than a horse
(BoJack!)
