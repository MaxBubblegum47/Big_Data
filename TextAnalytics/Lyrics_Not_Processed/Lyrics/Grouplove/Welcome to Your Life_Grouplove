[Post-Chorus]
We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you
We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you

[Verse 1]
Mean man, promised land
Nothing but a devil's hand
Trying to keep saying I feel okay
Telling myself this now for days

[Verse 2]
Mean man, machine man
I've been nothing but a puppets hand
But nothing ever comes
Without a change

[Chorus]
Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, yeah, yeah
Welcome to your world, my girl
Let it be your fantasy, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus]
We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you
We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
La la, love you

[Verse 3]
Been wondering, I take a chance
That chance is circumstance
Cause nothing ever comes without a change

[Chorus]
Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, yeah, yeah
Welcome to your world, my girl
Let it be your fantasy, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, I've figured it out, I've seen the unknown
Like a shot in the dark, I'll carry you home
Ask a wise man
He'll say what's been done
All the roads in this world
Were made by the young, by the young

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, here's the deal
We're back in business
Hey, here's the deal
We're back in business
Hey, here's the deal
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you

[Chorus]
Welcome to your, welcome to your
Welcome to your world, my girl
Let it be your fantasy, oh yeah
Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, oh yeah
