[Verse 1]
Tell me that I've never been the same, I never noticed that
And nothing ever holds me, nothing ever holds me back
And it seems you never think of how I wanted you
Yeah, you say I'm someone, you say I'm something free

[Pre-Chorus]
You had a lifetime living on your own time
You had a life time living

[Chorus]
So tell me, do you love someone?
I'm losing all the time I had
I never had to know about another
Know about the other side
So tell me, do you love someone?
I'm losing all the time I had
I never had to know about the other
Know about the other side

[Verse 2]
I can never seem to get all of my words across
But you say I'm someone, you say I'm something free
Yeah, I wish I saw myself the way you see me now
Cause you see that someone I always want to be

[Pre-Chorus]
You had a lifetime living on your own time
You had a life time living

[Chorus]
So tell me, do you love someone?
I'm losing all the time I had
I never had to know about another
Know about the other side
So tell me, do you love someone?
I'm losing all the time I had
I never had to know about the other
Know about the other side

[Bridge]
And you keep talking so the talking's all we got
Can we keep walking 'til we're turning back the clock
Yeah, we can fight 'til there's nothing left to lose
Let's let it all come down

[Pre-Chorus]
You had a lifetime living on your own time
You had a lifetime living on your own time
You had a lifetime living on your own time
You had a life time living

[Chorus]
So tell me, do you love someone?
I'm losing all the time I had
I never had to know about another
Know about the other side

[Outro]
And you keep talking so the talking's all we got
Can we keep walking 'til we're turning back the clock
Yeah, we can fight 'til there's nothing left to lose
Let's let it all come down
