[Verse 1]
What's up!
Aw damn it baby you bad
Yeah yeah yeah, heard you got a boyfriend
That's cool girl where is he at?
Oh he fucked up
You lucked up
You done ran into the motherfuckin' man
I'm gonna make you my bae for a day
He should be happy I'm giving you back
'Cause I can make you wifey for a week
We can spend a weekend in Japan
If anyone fuck with my akachan
Tell em' they'll get fucking Jackie Chan-ed
Honestly I'm better as your boy
I'd be kinda shitty as your man
Let's go back to only being friends
Sorry girl I hope you understand

[Chorus: Jane Chile & 
KYLE
]
It's just that
I don't want to fall in love (No, no) (
Nope
)
Love cuts just like a knife (
That's right
)
You make the knife feel good (Baby) (
So good, so good
)
I’ll fight you 'til the end (
Uh, uh, uh, uh
)
I don't want to fall in love (No, no) (
Nah, haha
)
Love cuts just like a knife (
That's right
)
You make the knife feel good (Baby) (
So good, so good
)
I’ll fight you 'til the end (
Uh, uh, uh, uh
)

[Bridge: KYLE & 
Jane 
Child
]
I wasn't leading you on girl (
No, no
)
I just forgot where I was goin'
I got way too attached (
Baby
)
That wasn't the plan
And I knew a girl just like you once (You once)
We ended up hating each other
'Cause we couldn't let it end (
No, no
)
That can’t happen again, no

[Chorus: Jane Chile]
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end

[Verse 2]
Someone put em up ding-ding-ding
Pulling on my heart strings zing-zing-zing
But I’m trying to let go
But it's hard enough to leave you alone
With the phone goin' ring ring ring
Please let me go
'Cause I don’t want to fall in love
'Cause the last time left me cold
When she left my house, she didn’t even let me know
Nigga she ain’t even leave me notes
Part of the reason I’m easily hurt
Part of the reason I’m leaving you first
Pardon that, part of me give my apologies
I know that working on it never works
And I’m sorry it’s you, but hey what should I do?
Be happy with lies? Or be sad with the truth?
Don’t be ashamed you see love is a game and I still want to play
I’m just too scared to lose and I know you are too

[Chorus: Jane Child & 
KYLE
]
I don’t wanna fall in love (No, no)
(
But it's, it's good, you know?
)
Love cuts just like a knife
(
I mean we're young, we don't need to be all tied down
)
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
(
Yo, yo,  honestly fuck this shit, um, yo let's just boogie, alright?
)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
I don't want to fall in love (No, no)
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good (Baby)
I’ll fight you 'til the end
