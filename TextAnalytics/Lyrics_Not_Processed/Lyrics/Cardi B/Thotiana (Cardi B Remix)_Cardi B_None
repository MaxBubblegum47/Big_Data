[Verse 1: Cardi B]
(Cardi!) Cardiana (Cardiana)
I was home with my kid, mommiana (Mommiana)
Real bitch, I don't be with all that drama (Nah)
Mindin’ my business, I'm unbothered (I'm unbothered, yeah)
I ain’t draggin', I'm lit (Like a tit)
Fuck clappin' back, bitch, I'm clappin' on the dick (On the dick)
Bust it, bust it, I'm a savage (I'm a savage)
Bitch, throw it back like a 10-Year Challenge (Woo!)
Take him to the crib, then I push him on the sofa (Sofa)
Have his breath smellin’ like pussy and mimosas (Ah, ah, ah)
Uh, we ain’t finished, tell him beat it up (Beat it up)
And if the pussy stop breathin', give it CPR (CPR, hah, hah)
It’s so tight, he think he slipped in my butt (Slipped in my butt)
I don't swallow Plan B, I just swallow the nut (Uh, nasty)
Pussy dope, I'm the dope dealer
And if your pussy good, shouldn't have to maintain a broke nigga (Broke nigga)
Real shit, real life
Everybody gangbangin’, know they ain't real, right (Yeah right now)
Since I came in the game, been a real one (Real one)
And ain't shit changed, bitch, I'm still one (Ah)
Uh, all facts, no cap (No cap)
Daddy, how you like that? (Like that?)
Uh, ain't got no time for no subliminals
After a while, bitch, bein' petty just means you miserable (Facts)
Uh, yeah, straight lame (Straight lame)
My pussy a bustdown, your's plain jane (Bust it)
I make him go insane, I fuck him with my red flag on
And when I cum, I say "gang!" (On the gang)

[Chorus: Blueface]
Bust down, Thotiana (Bust down, Thotiana)
I wanna see you bust down (Over)
Pick it up, now break that shit down (Break it down)
Speed it up, then slow that shit down, on the gang (Slow it down)
Bust it (Bust down), bust down, bust it, bust it
Bust down, on the gang (Over)
Bust down, Thotiana (Bust down, Thotiana)
I wanna see you bust down (Over)
Pick it up, now break that shit down (Break it down)
Speed it up, now slow that shit down, on the gang (Slow it down)
Bust it (Bust down), bust down, bust it, bust it
Bust down, on the gang (Over)

[Verse 2: Blueface]
Blueface, baby
Yeah aight, I'm every woman's fantasy (Blueface, baby)
Mama always told me I was gon' break hearts
I guess it's her fault, stupid, don't be mad at me (Don't be mad at me)
I wanna see you bust down (Bust down)
Bend that shit over, on the gang (Yeah, aight)
Make that shit clap
She threw it back so I had to double back, on the gang (On the gang)
Smackin', high off them drugs (Off them drugs)
I tried tell myself two times was enough (Was enough)
Then a nigga relapsed, on the dead locs
Ain't no runnin', Thotiana, you gon' take these damn strokes (Thotiana)
I beat the pussy up, now it's a murder scene
Keep shit player, Thotiana, like you ain't never even heard of me (Blueface, baby)
Bust down, Thotiana, I wanna see you bust down (Bust down)
Bend that shit over (Bend it over)
Yeah aight, now make that shit clap, on the gang (Make it clap)
Now toot that thing up (Toot it up)
Throw that shit back (Throw it back)
I need my extras, on the dead locs

[Chorus: Blueface & Cardi B]
Bust down, Thotiana, bust down, Thotiana
I wanna see you bust down (Over)
Lick it up, now slurp that shit down
Jerk it off, now throw that dick down, on the gang  (Slow it down)
Bust it (Bust down), bust down, bust it, bust it
Bust down, on the gang (Over)
Bust down, Thotiana (Bust down, Thotiana)
