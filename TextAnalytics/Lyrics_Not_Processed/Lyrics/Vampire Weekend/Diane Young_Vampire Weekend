[Verse 1]
You torched a Saab like a pile of leaves
I'd gone to find some better wheels
Four, five meters runnin' 'round the bend
When the government agents surround you again

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Verse 2]
Out of control but you're playing a role
Do you think you can go til the 18th hole
Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship?
Try to go it alone on your own for a bit

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a light on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a lifetime
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time
Ooh, you let 'em go
Di-Di, Di-Di-Di-Di

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Verse 3]
Irish and proud, baby, naturally
But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel, keep on holdin' it tight
'Til you're tottering off into that goodnight

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a light on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a lifetime
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Verse 4]
Nobody knows what the future holds
And it’s bad enough just getting old
Live my life in self-defense
You know I love the past, ’cause I hate suspense

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time
