[Verse 1]
When I was younger no one ever
Could tell me how to live my life
I started trouble, that's what young
Kids do and I was young alright
And my teacher said I'd be a failure
They called my mama just to tell her
"Oh, your son is trouble, there's no doubt
He's never gonna leave this town"

[Chorus]
Well, mama look at me now
Catch me waving from the sky in a brand new G-5
Mama look at me now
They said that kid was on slide, but he's doing alright
Mama look at me now (hey!)
Mama look at me now (hey!)
Mama look at me now (hey!)
Mama look at me now (hey!)
Mama look at me now

[Verse 2]
When I was younger no one ever
Could tell me how to live my life
I told my mama not to worry 'cause
She worried 'bout my world outside
They gave me pills to make me better
They called my mama just to tell her
"Oh, your son is trouble, good for nothing
He ain't ever gonna leave this town"

[Chorus]
Well, mama look at me now
Catch me waving from the sky in a brand new G-5
Mama look at me now
They said that kid was on slide, but he's doing alright
Mama look at me now (hey!)
Mama look at me now (hey!)
Mama look at me now (hey!)
Mama look at me now (hey!)
Mama look at me now
Mama look at me now
Mama look at me now
