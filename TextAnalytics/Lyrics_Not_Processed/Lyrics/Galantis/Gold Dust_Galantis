[Verse 1]
You're like gold dust
It rains over me
A foreign sun that I thought I'd never see
You're like gold dust

[Pre-Drop]
Oh, don't change ever, no, don't change
There's a hollow in this house, whenever you go

[Verse 2]
You're like gold dust
It rains over me
A foreign sun my eyes thought I'd never see
You're like gold dust

[Pre-Drop]
Keep coming down that street
There's a hollow in this house, whenever you go

[Drop]

[Pre-Drop]
Keep coming down that street
There's a hollow in this house, whenever you go

[Drop]
Keep coming down that street
There's a hollow in this house, whenever you go

[Outro]
You're like gold dust
