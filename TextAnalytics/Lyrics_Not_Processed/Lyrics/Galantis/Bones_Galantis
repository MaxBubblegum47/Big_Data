[Intro: Ryan Tedder]
Woah, woah

[Verse 1: Ryan Tedder]
You bring an energy I've never felt before
Some kind of chemical that reaches through my core
Feels like, as far as you and me, I've never had a choice
You feel like home, hmm
You're like the opposite of all of my mistakes (Hey)
Tear down the biggest walls and put me in my place
I know, that kind of comfortable you cannot replicate
You feel like home, hmm

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
So if you're asking me
Say, "Oh, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart, no

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul
That's how you know, that's how I know
I feel it in my bones (Hey)

[Post-Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
(Hey)
And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul (Hey)
That's how you know, that's how I know
I feel it in my bones

[Verse 2: Ryan Tedder]
So many people just walk in and out your life (Hey)
I'd trade a couple hundred just to get some time back, that's right
'Cause, for you and me, I got no alibi
You feel like home, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
So if you're asking me
Sayin', "Oh, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart, no

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones, yeah
And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul
That's how you know, that's how I know
I feel it in my bones

[Post-Chorus]
I feel it in my bones (Hey)
Yeah, I feel it in my bones
Oh, that's how you know, that's how I know (Hey)

[Bridge: Ryan Tedder]
So if you're asking me
Sayin', "Boy, how do you know?"
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart, no

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
I feel it in my bones (Hey)
I feel it in my bones, yeah (Hey)
And I know when it cuts deep down
Through your chest into your soul (Hey)
That's how you know, that's how I know
I feel it in my bones

[Post-Chorus]
I feel it in my bones (Hey)
I feel it in my bones
Oh, that's how you know, that's how I know (Hey)
I feel it in my bones
