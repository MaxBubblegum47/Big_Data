[Chorus]
I am the hunter, I am the great unknown
Only my love can conquer
I am the, I am the hunter (I am the hunter)
I am the hunter, into the wild, we go
Give up your heart, surrender
'Cause I am the, I am the hunter (I am the—hey!)

[Verse 1]
We've been on this road
To a place that, one day, we'll know
Adventure to the other side (I am the, I am the)
Searching high and low for the treasure deep in your soul
The fortune teller's always right

[Pre-Chorus]
Got them red eyes in the night
Like a panther, outta sight
Gonna sing my battle cry
'Cause I am the, I am the, I am the

[Chorus]
I am the hunter, I am the great unknown
Only my love can conquer
I am the, I am the hunter (I am the hunter)
I am the hunter, into the wild, we go
Give up your heart, surrender
'Cause I am the, I am the hunter (I am the—hey!)

[Post-Chorus]
I am the
I am the, I am the
I am the
I am the, I am the, I am the, I am the

[Verse 2]
Strangers wild and free
Through the flames, you're all that I see
A force you, that you can't deny (I am the, I am the)
Hear my calling
Lock and load, come running to me
Dancing through the midnight (I am the, I am the)

[Pre-Chorus]
Got them red eyes in the night
Like a panther, outta sight
Gonna sing my battle cry
'Cause I am the, I am the, I am the

[Chorus]
I am the hunter, I am the great unknown
Only my love can conquer
I am the, I am the hunter (I am the hunter)
I am the hunter, into the wild, we go
Give up your heart, surrender
'Cause I am the, I am the hunter (I am the—hey!)

[Post-Chorus]
I am the
I am the, I am the
I am the

[Outro]
I am the, I am the, I am the
I am the, I am the, I am the hunt-
I am the, I am the, I am the
I am-I am, I am-I am, I am-I am
Hunter
