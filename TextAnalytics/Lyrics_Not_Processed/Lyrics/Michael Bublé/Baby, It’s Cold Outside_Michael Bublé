[Verse 1: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
Baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just half a soda pop more
Put some records on while I pour

[Verse 2: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, was that a wink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to get home for dinner
Mind if I move in closer?
So it's time for me to cast you aside
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Baby it's cold outside

[Interlude: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
You're very pushy, you know
I'd like to think of it as opportunistic

[Verse 3: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
So thanks for the show
But, baby, it's cold outside
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips are delicious
But maybe just another dance more
Never such a blizzard before

[Verse 4: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
I've got to get home
Baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb?
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when I touch your hand
But don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life-long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you got pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that hold out
Baby it's cold
Baby it's cold outside

[Spoken Outro: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
Okay, fine, just another drink
That took a lot of convincing
