[Verse 1]
I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility

[Chorus]
And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

[Verse 2]
I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby, your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

[Chorus]
And somehow, I know that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you, kid, I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

[Bridge]
They say all’s fair in love and war
But I won’t need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united

[Chorus 2]
And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

[Bridge]
And someday, I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you, kid, I'll give more than I get
Than I get, than I get, than I get

[Chorus]
Oh, you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you, kid, to give so much more than I get, yeah
I just haven't met you yet

[Outro]
I just haven't met you yet
Oh, promise you, kid, to give so much more than I get
I said love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I just haven't met you yet
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Yeah, I just haven't met you yet
