[Verse 1: Michael Bublé]
I love seeing you happy
I miss seeing that smile
It's been such a long time
And although I don't have you
I know now that I need to
Somehow make you mine
And I won't lie, it's hard seeing you with him
'Cause I know he can't hold you like I can

[Chorus: Michael Bublé & Meghan Trainor]
Someday maybe when we're old and gray
We could be in love once more
'Til then I won't give my love away
Darling, I'm forever only yours

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor]
I remember that love song
I sang every word wrong
But you didn't mind, no no
And I'll admit that I miss you
But only if you do
'Cause you know that I'm shy
And I can't lie, it's hard seeing you with her
'Cause I know she can't love you like I can

[Chorus: Michael Bublé & Meghan Trainor]
Someday maybe when we're old and gray
We could be in love once more
'Til then I won't give my love away
Darling, I'm forever only yours

[Bridge: Michael Bublé & Meghan Trainor]
If my lovin' works for you
Then we've got nothing to lose
'Cause I'm forever only yours (in love once more, once more, once more)
No need to complicate it
That smile is worth the wait, yeah
I'm forever only yours (hey, yeah)
Someday maybe
Someday maybe
Someday maybe I'll be yours (woah, baby)
Someday maybe (someday maybe)
Someday maybe (someday maybe)
Someday maybe I'll be yours (someday maybe I'll be yours)

[Chorus: Michael Bublé & Meghan Trainor]
Someday maybe when we're old and gray
We could be in love once more
'Til then I won't give my love away
Darling, I'm forever only yours

[Outro: Michael Bublé & Meghan Trainor]
If my lovin' works for you
We've got nothing to lose
'Cause I'm forever only yours (someday maybe I'll be yours)
Not need to complicate it
That smile is worth the wait, yeah
I'm forever only yours (someday maybe I'll be yours)
I said now, I'm forever only yours
I said now, I'm forever only yours
