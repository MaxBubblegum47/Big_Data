New Years Eve, 1991
Four of my best friends have been diagnosed with HIV
This could be the year that we lose one of them
This could be the year that we lose them all

525,600 minutes
525,000 moments so dear
525,600 minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?

The holidays were the hardest to get through
I just got some very discouraging news
And I don't know how Iâ€™m getting...
Hey, hey, hey, just take it day-by-day
Hour-by-hour
Even minute-by-minute

In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife
In 525,600 minutes
How do you measure a year in the life?

How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love

525,600 minutes
525,000 journeys to plan
525,600 minutes
How do you measure the life of a woman or a man?

In truths that she learned, or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned, or the way that she died

It's time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate, remember a year
In the life of friends

Remember the love
Oh, you got to, you got to remember the love
Remember the love
You got to feel it, yeah
Remember the love
Share the love
Measure in love
Measure your life, measure your life in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Measure your life, measure your life in love
