[Verse 1: Lettie Lutz]
I am not a stranger to the dark
"Hideaway," they say
"'Cause we don't want your broken parts"
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
"Runaway," they say
"No one'll love you as you are"

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus: Ensemble]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Lettie Lutz, 
Ensemble
]
Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun
(We are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become
(Yeah, that's what we've become)

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz and Ensemble]
I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz and Ensemble]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus: Lettie Lutz and Ensemble, 
Ensemble
]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
This is me

[Bridge: Lettie Lutz, 
Ensemble
]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I know that I deserve your love
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's nothing I'm not worthy of
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
)

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
This is brave, this is bruised
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me

Look out 'cause here I come
(Look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum

this is me

(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
 When the sharpest words wanna cut me down

I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
