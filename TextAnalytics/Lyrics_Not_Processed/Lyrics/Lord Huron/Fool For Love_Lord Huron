I’m leaving this place behind, and I’m heading out on the road tonight
I’m off for the hinterlands, way up north where the tall trees stand
Before I commence my ride
, 
I'm asking Lily to be my bride
I know there's another man
 but he ain't gonna delay my plans
I know she's gonna be my wife
Gonna fall in love, I'm gonna live my life with her
You know, I bet he's not so tough
Ain't afraid of him 'cause I'm a fool for love
I come for to find Big Jim, well, here I am and I guess you’re him
I see how you got your name, you're tall as hell and broad as a train
They say you’re a hard worn man
The baddest guy in the whole wide land
Well, I'm not afraid to fight, let's step outside and I'll show you why
I'm hummin' like a revved up truck
Nevermind the odds, I'm gonna try my luck with her
Just tell me when you've had enough
I'm dangerous 'cause I'm a fool for love
You know, you don't hit half bad
Oh, but I'm gonna lay you to ground tonight
Just wait until I catch my breath
Gonna send you on to an early death
I lie in the drifting snow, bleeding out as it covers me, oh
If spring comes before I’m found, just throw my bones in a hole in the ground
I lost friends along my way, I knew I’d meet them eventually
No, I’m not afraid to die, I’m just mad I left Big Jim alive
I know I should have never looked back
But you ain’t gonna win a woman’s heart like that
I never should have called his bluff
I was born to lose 'cause I’m a fool for love
I stare into the endless sky
And the sorry tale of my life goes by
I drift into the great unknown
I really don’t know where I’m goin'
I stare into the endless sky
And the sorry tale of my life goes by
I drift into the great unknown
I really don’t know where I’m goin'
