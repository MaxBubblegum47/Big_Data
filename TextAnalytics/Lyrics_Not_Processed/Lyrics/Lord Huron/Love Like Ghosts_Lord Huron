[Verse 1]
Yes, I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, few have seen it, but everybody talks
Spirits follow everywhere I go
Oh, they sing all day and they haunt me in the night
Oh, they sing all day and they haunt me in the night

[Verse 2]
Yes, I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, and what ain't living can never really die
You don't want me, baby, please don't lie
Oh, but if you're leaving, I gotta know why
I said if you're leaving, I gotta know why
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night

[Verse 3]
Yes I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, and the moonlight, baby, shows you what's real
There ain't language for the things I feel
And if I can't have you, then no one ever will
Oh, if I can't have you, then no one ever will

[Chorus]
I don't feel it till it hurts sometimes
Oh, go on baby, hurt me tonight
I want ours to be an endless song
Baby, in my eyes, you do no wrong
I don't feel it till it hurts sometimes
So go on, baby, hurt me tonight
All the spirits that I know I saw
Do you see no ghost in me at all?

[Outro]
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
