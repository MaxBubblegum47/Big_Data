[Verse 1]
Well, the neon lights burned red and gold
I came to have my fortune told
Can't imagine what she saw
While gazing in her crystal ball

[Verse 2]
Far out past the astral plane
I cast you back from whence you came
Cosmic ash and blackened brain
I call you by your ancient names

[Chorus]
I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her

[Verse 3]
What the fortune teller said is
I'm alive for now but good as dead
She claims she'd seen it all
While she was gazing in her crystal ball

[Verse 4]
If I can't evade my fate
Then I won't sit around and wait
A fallen star will be thy bane
I call you by your ancient names

[Chorus/Hook]
I gotta get away from here
(I'll never see another sunrise)
I gotta get away from her
(Oh, if I leave this place alive)
I gotta get away from here
(I'll never see another sunrise)
Oh I gotta get away from her

[Chorus]
I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her
I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her

[Outro]
I gotta get away from here
If I live to see the next sunrise
I gotta get away from her
Oh, if I leave this place alive
