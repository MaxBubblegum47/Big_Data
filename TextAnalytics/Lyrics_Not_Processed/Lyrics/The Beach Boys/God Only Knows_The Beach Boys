[Verse 1: Carl Wilson]
I may not always love you
But as long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

[Chorus: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Verse 2: Carl Wilson]
If you should ever leave me
Well, life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

[Chorus: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Verse 3: Carl Wilson]
If you should ever leave me
Well, life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

[Chorus: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Outro: Carl Wilson, Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston]
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
