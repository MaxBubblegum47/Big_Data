[Verse 1]
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

[Verse 2]
Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Exci - tations)

[Outro]
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'
(Ahh)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations) (Good vibrations bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations
Na na na na na, na na na

Na na na na na, na na na (Ba da da, duh da, da)
Na na na na na, na na na (Ba da da, duh da, da)
