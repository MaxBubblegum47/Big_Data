[Chorus]
Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

[Verse 1]
Blood money, blood money
How did you afford this ring that I love, honey?
"Just another shift at the drug company"
He doesn't think I'm that fucking dumb, does he?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It doesn't matter what you pull up to your home
We know what goes on inside
You call that ass your own, we call that silicone
Silly girl with silly boys

[Chorus]
Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

[Breakdown]
Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup, in a sippy cup, sippy cup
In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup

[Verse 2]
Pill diet, pill diet, if they give you a new pill then you will buy it
If they say to kill yourself, then you will try it
All the makeup in the world won't make you less insecure

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You got weights in your pockets when you go to the doctors
Your favorite candy's cotton, that's why all your teeth are rotten
Silly girls with silly boys

[Chorus]
Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

[Breakdown]
Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup, in a sippy cup, sippy cup
In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup

[Chorus]
Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
