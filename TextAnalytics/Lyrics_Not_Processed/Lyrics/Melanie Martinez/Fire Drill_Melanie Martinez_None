[Intro]
Oh, oh, mmm, mm-mmm
Oh, oh, mmm, oh

[Verse 1]
I've never fit into any category, always deemed an outcast
Since I was in Sunday School and all the cool kids said I was weird
It's exactly the same, they say, "Why do you dress that way?
Why do you act that way? Why aren't you just like me?"
So is that what you really wanna say to me?
You're playin' games with me
Tellin' me if I'm unkind, still you abandon me
Calling me words I'm not, paintin' a picture that's false
You must not know my heart, but I know it isn't your fault
You live in a world in your clutch, you don't get out very much
Livin' in a fake world, full of facades and chaotic behavior
You pull the lever for fun, yell, "Fire," then you just run

[Chorus]
Fire drill, what would happen if a nuke just hit?
Would you say bye to your family? Would you post about it?
Fire drill, if it all went up in flames one day
Would you give your mom a hug before your house burned away?
It kills, I wish the best for you
And you think I ignore you too, but
Really, I'm tryna live my own life
And be present more, and so should you, it's alright to

[Verse 2]
Cryin' inside
'Cause nothin' I say ever comes out right
We're on the same side
If I'm honest with you, you just run and hide
I'm bad at public speaking
But I'm speaking now so hear me out (Shut up)
I personally believe that everyone is fully capable
Of more than what they're doing
All of the bullyin', all of the screwin' around
With people they don't even really know, oh (Blah, blah, blah)
Eatin' a hate soufflé, and an angry bitter sorbet
All 'cause you were bored one day
Losin' your wits and your grace

[Chorus]
Fire drill, what would happen if a nuke just hit?
Would you say bye to your family? Would you post about it?
Fire drill, if it all went up in flames one day
Would you give your mom a hug before your house burned away?
It kills, I wish the best for you
And you think I ignore you too, but
Really, I'm tryna live my own life
And be present more, and so should you, it's alright to

[Bridge]
I am not the government, I am not the fucked-up men
I am not a part of anything that is hateful
Love is seepin' out my pores, I don't hold anger anymore
Even for people who hurt and betrayed me (Okay)
I am not the government, I am not the fucked-up men (Gross)
I am not a part of anything that is hateful
Love is seepin' out my pores, I don't hold anger anymore
Even for people who hurt and betrayed me

[Chorus]
Fire drill, what would happen if a nuke just hit?
Would you say bye to your family? Would you post about it?
Fire drill, if it all went up in flames one day
Would you give your mom a hug before your house burned away?
It kills, I wish the best for you
And you think I ignore you too, but
Really, I'm tryna live my own life
And be present more, and so should you, it's alright to

[Outro]
I'm getting out of here
