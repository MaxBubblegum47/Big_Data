[Verse 1]
I've never been the type
Who needs someone to blow their mind
To climb my tower
To bring me flowers
But if you wanna wake me up
With some coffee in a cup
And talk for hours
I'd like the sound of that

[Pre-Chorus]
But you don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable

[Chorus]
I know I'm gonna call you on my phone
Know I'm gonna ask when you get home
I already know what's next
I end up in your bed
Then you're gonna put back on your clothes
And I'm gonna wish I was alone
But we never change a step
Then do it all again
I'm bored

[Verse 2]
I just want some company
When I'm not between your sheets
But I'm not dramatic
So I pick my battles, yeah
No, I'm not saying we don't do it good
Don't think I'd trade it if I could
It don't matter, though
It don't matter, no

[Pre-Chorus]
But you don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable

[Chorus]
I know I'm gonna call you on my phone
Know I'm gonna ask when you get home
I already know what's next
I end up in your bed
Then you're gonna put back on your clothes
And I'm gonna wish I was alone
But we never change a step
Then do it all again
I'm bored

[Bridge]
Not saying we don't do it good
(Not saying, not saying, not saying)
Don't think I'd trade it if I could
(Not saying, not saying, not saying)
Not saying we don't do it good
(Not saying, not saying, not saying)
Don't think I'd trade it if I could
It don't matter, no

[Chorus]
I know I'm gonna call you on my phone
Know I'm gonna ask when you get home
I already know what's next
I end up in your bed
Then you're gonna put back on your clothes
And I'm gonna wish I was alone
But we never change a step
Then do it all again
I'm bored

[Outro]
You don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable
I'm bored
You don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable
I'm bored
