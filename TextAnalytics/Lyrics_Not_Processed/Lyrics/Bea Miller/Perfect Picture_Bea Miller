[Verse 1]
I can't believe that I ended up here
I can't believe, I can't believe that
Just when I thought that the road was so clear
Had no idea, had no idea

[Pre-Chorus]
You'd come right out of nowhere
Spin me around
How did you make my world come crashing down

[Chorus]
Tonight, you made my perfect picture look like black and white
I know I've never seen my colors so alive
With you around, I know that we're gonna be fine
Tonight, you made my perfect picture come to life

[Verse 2]
We always think that we know what we want
That's where we go, but where we going?
We always think we have it all figured out
But all we know, we know is nothing
One thing can make it all change
So hold on tight, hold on tight
One thing can make it all change
In just one night, I don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
You'd come right out of nowhere
Spin me around
How did you make my world come crashing down

[Chorus]
Tonight, you made my perfect picture look like black and white
I know I've never seen my colors so alive
With you around, I know that we're gonna be fine
Tonight, you made my perfect picture come to life, life, life
You made my perfect picture come to life, life
And I don't know
And I don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
You came right out of nowhere
Spin me around
How did you make my world come crashing down?

[Chorus]
Tonight, you made my perfect picture look like black and white
I know I've never seen my colors so alive
With you around, I know that we're gonna be fine
Tonight, you made my perfect picture come to life
Tonight, you made my perfect picture come to life
Tonight, you made my perfect picture come to life
