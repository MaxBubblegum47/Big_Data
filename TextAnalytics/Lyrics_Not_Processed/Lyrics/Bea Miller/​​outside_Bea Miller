[Verse 1]
I'm so bored
I think I'll burn all my clothes
Standing in the bathroom, singing alone
I don't even like this song
Rolling up, getting comfortable
I've been drinking kitchen table coffee alone
Can never get high enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Paint dries
Like my tired eyes
Rain cries
I don't wanna go outside

[Chorus]
Can’t think of other ways I wanna waste my time
All I do is fuck around with words that rhyme
I wish I didn't wonder why, I wonder why, why I
It doesn't even matter all the things I say
When nobody is listening to me anyway
I don't even like my friends tonight
I must be out of my mind
I don't wanna go outside

[Verse 2]
I walk my dog, but never too far from home
'Cause I need to make it back to watch That '70s Show
I lay around on the floor
I hate my phone
'Cause it reminds me that I'm alone
I got people calling me
But I let them know that I'm unavailable

[Pre-Chorus]
Paint dries
Like my tired eyes
Rain cries
I don't wanna go outside

[Chorus]
Can’t think of other ways I wanna waste my time
All I do is fuck around with words that rhyme
I wish I didn't wonder why, I wonder why, why I
It doesn't even matter all the things I say
When nobody is listening to me anyway
I don't even like my friends tonight
I must be out of my mind

[Bridge]
I might be standing
Still as I can be
But my mind keeps running and running in circles around me
I might be waiting an eternity
While my mind keeps running and running in circles around me

[Chorus]
Can’t think of other ways I wanna waste my time
All I do is fuck around with words that rhyme
I wish I didn't wonder why, I wonder why, why I
It doesn't even matter all the things I say
When nobody is listening to me anyway
I don't even like my friends tonight
I must be out of my mind

[Outro]
I might be standing
Still as I can be
But my mind keeps running and running in circles around me
