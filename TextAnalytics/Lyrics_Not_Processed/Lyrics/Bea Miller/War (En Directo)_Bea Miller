[Verse 1: Paty Cantu & Bea Miller]
I see you in the hallway
I hear you smash the door
All this broken china
Just lying on the floor
The moment that you're gone
I feel so sad
I feel so numb
And when the fight is over
I still regret my heart
All I do is miss you
I guess I'll never learn
You and me were so damn proud
"I'm sorry" is all to say out loud

[Chorus: Paty Cantu & Bea Miller]
War, when we go to war
Can't do this anymore
Waving flags, just running mad and breaking bad
It's war
Life is getting sour
When we go to war
Oh
War, when we go to war
What's it good for?
All the pain is for no gain
And who's to blame in war?
Can't do this anymore
When we go to war
When we go to war

[Verse 2: Bea Miller & Paty Cantu]
And when you come back home
And plan your self defense
We start building up
And nothing's making sense
Who knew deep inside
The scars are tearing up our hearts

[Chorus: Paty Cantu & Bea Miller]
War, when we go to war
Can't do this anymore
Waving flags, just running mad and breaking bad
It's war
Life is getting sour
When we go to war
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, war, when we go to war
What's it good for?
All the pain is for no gain
And who's to blame in war?
Can't do this anymore
When we go to war
When we go to war

[Bridge: Paty Cantu & Bea Miller]
Let's make a deal
Right here and now
No more grenades
Just stop the fight
'Cause all this fight is such a waste
And all we do is fall from grace
And what we have is strong
Let's wave the white flag
Let's wave the white flag
Let's wave the white flag
Let's wave the white flag
Let's wave the white flag
Let's wave the white flag

[Chorus in Spanish: Paty Cantu & Bea Miller]
Vuelve
Vuelve, por éste amor valiente
No hay nada que no enfrente
La guerra es contra comprender que sólo somos gente (oh, oh)
Que ama y que miente (oh, oh)
Perdóname mi amor
Perdóname mi amor

[Chorus: Bea Miller & Paty Cantu]
It's war
War, when we go to war
Can't do this anymore
Waving flags, just running mad and breaking bad
It's war
Life is getting sour
When we go to war

[Outro: Paty Cantu]
Let's wave the white flag
