[Verse 1: Bea Miller]
Bring out the worst in me
'Cause it's all you see
But you always Make My Heart Go
Make My Heart Go
If I wanna bury deep and you set it free
But you always Make My Heart Go
Make My Heart Go

[Chorus: Julia Michaels & Bea Miller]
I felt your skin on mine and my lungs filled like an ocean
'Cause you still take my breathe away
You always know what to say
To turn it around
And if you wanted to
You could be the one to turn me down
Anything without waves
To hear it pound
I'm so effected
But you end up didn't know that

[Refrain: Julia Michaels]
Now you always Make My Heart Go
Make My Heart Go
You always Make My Heart Go
Heart go

[Verse 2: Bea Miller]
No heart to break but bring it to my knees
'Cause you make me weak but you always Make My Heart Go
Make My Heart Go
You made yourself my everything
Can you let me be
So that I can make my heart slow
Make my heart slow

[Chorus: Julia Michaels & Bea Miller]
I felt your skin on mine and I I feel like an ocean
'Cause you still take my breathe away
You always know what to say
To turn it around
And if you wanted to
You could be the one to turn me down
Anything without waves
To hear it pound
I'm so effected
But you end up and I know that

[Refrain: Julia Michaels]
Now you always Make My Heart Go
Make My Heart Go
You always Make My Heart Go
Heart go
You always Make My Heart Go
Make My Heart Go
You always Make My Heart Go
Heart go

[Bridge: Julia Michaels]
Bum-bum-ba-lum-bum-bum-bum
But trust me you're the only one
Bum-bum-ba-lum-bum-bum-bum
But trust me you're the only one
Bum-bum-ba-lum-bum-bum-bum
You're the only one

[Chorus: Julia Michaels]
You always know what to say
To turn it around
And if you wanted to
You could be the one to turn me down
Anything without waves
To hear it pound
I'm so effected
But you end up and I know that

[Refrain: Julia Michaels]
Now you always Make My Heart Go
Make My Heart Go
You always Make My Heart Go
Heart go
You always Make My Heart Go
Make My Heart Go
You always Make My Heart Go
Heart go
