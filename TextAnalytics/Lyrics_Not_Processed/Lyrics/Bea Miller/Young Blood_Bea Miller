[Verse 1]
We were making history
Breaking rules and breaking free
Questioning the writing on the wall
Coming from the underground
Laughing as we're falling down
Soaking in the glory of it all

[Pre-Chorus]
But in dark times when we close our eyes
It's a nightmare, it’s a nightmare
When the sun don't shine we lose our minds
But I swear, we can get there

[Chorus]
We've got young blood, can't destroy us
We make our own luck in this world
We've got young blood, no one chose us
We make our own love in this world

[Verse 2]
Someday we could run away
See it all before the pictures fade
And bottle up the feeling in a jar
Pass around to all our friends
We can breathe it in and out again
Huddled in the backseat of the car

[Pre-Chorus]
But in dark times when we close our eyes
It's a nightmare, it’s a nightmare
When the sun don't shine we lose our minds
But I swear, we can get there

[Chorus]
We've got young blood, can't destroy us
We make our own luck in this world
We've got young blood, no one chose us
We make our own love in this world

[Bridge]
And the voices will get loud
If you never learn to shut them out
If you're lost you can be found
If you follow me until you hear the sound
Put em up, put em up now
If you know we're never backing down
We're never backing down, no
Hey!

[Chorus]
We've got young blood, can't destroy us
We make our own luck in this world
We've got young blood, no one chose us
We make our own love in this world
We've got young blood, can't destroy us
We make our own luck in this world
We've got young blood, no one chose us
We make our own love in this world

[Outro]
Yeah, cause we've got young blood
