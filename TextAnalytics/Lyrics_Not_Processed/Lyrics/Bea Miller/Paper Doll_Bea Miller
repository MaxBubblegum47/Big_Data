[Verse 1]
Does it make you feel good to make me feel small?
When you're pushing me down, does it make you feel tall?
Pointing out my flaws cause you wanna erase them all
Does it make you feel good to make me feel small?

[Pre-Chorus]
Betcha didn't think I knew what I was made of
Thought I would lay down, I wouldn't stand up
Well listen up cause you got it all wrong
This is your song, this is your song

[Chorus]
I'm not a paper doll, can't make me what you want
You just build me up and tear me down, enough's enough
Go, leave me alone, cut me down but I won't fall
I'm not a paper doll

[Verse 2]
Did somebody make you feel invisible?
Is it true hurt people hurt people?
The way you hate and break, it don't make no sense at all
But you're not gonna make me feel invisible

[Pre-Chorus]
Betcha didn't think I knew what I was made of
Thought I would lay down, I wouldn't stand up
Well listen up cause you got it all wrong
This is your song, this is your song

[Chorus]
I'm not a paper doll, can't make me what you want
You just build me up and tear me down, enough's enough
Go, leave me alone, cut me down but I won't fall
I'm not a paper doll
I'm not a paper doll, can't make me what you want
You just build me up and tear me down
Enough's enough, go, leave me alone, oh oh
Cut me down but I won't fall

[Bridge]
Oh, you'd love if you crumble me up in the palm of your hands
Well, I bet that sucks cause now you know you can't
Does it make you feel good to make me feel small?
When you're pushing me down, does it make you feel tall?

[Chorus]
I'm not a paper doll, can't make me what you want
You just build me up and tear me down, enough's enough
Go, leave me alone, cut me down but I won't fall
I'm not a paper doll
I'm not a paper doll, can't make me what you want
You just build me up and tear me down, enough's enough
Go, leave me alone, cut me down but I won't fall
I'm not a paper doll
