[Intro]
Nah, uh

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna keep running around
Like a chicken with her head cut off, oh
Violent metaphors are bringin' me down
But they're the only ones I'm thinkin' of
Am I the only one who hears a baby cry
And fantasizes ways that I could shut them up? Ha
I don't really like the way that sounds
But it's too late now (Too late now)

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I need help?

[Chorus]
Maybe I've been smokin' too much
Maybe I've been sleepin' not enough
Should I say (Hallelujah)?
Should I say (Hallelujah)?
Maybe I've been alone too much
Pretendin' that I never needed love
Should I say (Hallelujah)?
Should I say (Hallelujah)?

[Verse 2]
How am I supposed to work on myself
When there are Nazis in a big White House? Uh
It seems ridiculous to live in Hell
But I guess that's what we're doin' now
And maybe I should see a therapist
But the apocalypse is probably gonna take us out, uh
I don't really like the way that sounds
But it's too late now (Too late now)

[Pre-Chorus]
I might need help

[Chorus]
Maybe I've been smokin' too much
Maybe I've been sleepin' not enough
Should I say (Hallelujah)?
Should I say (Hallelujah)?
Maybe I've been alone too much
Pretendin' that I never needed love
Should I say (Hallelujah)?
Should I say (Hallelujah)?

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe that'll save me (Hallelujah)
Maybe that'll save me (Hallelujah)
Maybe that'll save me, oh (Hallelujah, hallelujah)
Nothing's gonna save me

[Bridge]
Only time I've gotten on my knees
I wasn't praying, ha

[Chorus]
Well, maybe I've been smokin' too much (Maybe I've been smokin' too much)
Maybe I've been sleepin' not enough (Not enough, hmm)
Should I say (Hallelujah)?
Should I say (Hallelujah)?
Maybe I've been alone too much (Alone too much)
Pretendin' that I never needed love (Never needed love)
Should I say (Hallelujah)?
Should I say (Hallelujah)?

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe that'll save me, yeah (Hallelujah)
Maybe that'll save me (Hallelujah)
Ooh, oh (Hallelujah, hallelujah)
Nothin', nothin' can save us now
