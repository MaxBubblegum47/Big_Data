[Chorus]
I don't wanna be your girlfriend
I just wanna play with your hair
When we get up in the morning
I'll be better on my own, I swear

[Verse 1]
Smoking in bed
Sleep in like the weekend
And you're in the kitchen
Why the fuck is you cleaning?
'Cause you're not my man
Don't get too comfortable in my skin, ooh
I told you before
It's not what I'm into
I'm trying to be clear
I'm not sending mixed signals
So why you still here?
Don't you got somewhere to be? Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a part of your plan
I don't need your love
I'm not a stranger to your touch
But it's not enough
Maybe honesty is missing here
But our bodies say it easier

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be your girlfriend
I just wanna play with your hair
When we get up in the morning
I'll be better on my own, I swear
I don't wanna be your girlfriend
I just wanna play with your hair
I prefer to tell the truth
But I'm not brave enough to lose what's already there

[Verse 2]
You text me all day
Yeah, I get the message
Nah uh, I can't hang
Why you get so defensive?
And nothing's gon' change
Don't get your hopes up about me, no, no
At the same time, when I get lonely
Drop everything when you see that I'm calling
'Cause just for the night
I'll be what you want me to be, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a part of your plan
I don't need your love (I don't need it)
I'm not a stranger to your touch
But it's not enough (it's not enough)
Maybe honesty is missing here
But our bodies say it easier

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be your girlfriend
I just wanna play with your hair
When we get up in the morning
I'll be better on my own, I swear
I don't wanna be your girlfriend
I just wanna play with your hair
I prefer to tell the truth
But I'm not brave enough to lose what's already there
