[Verse 1]
Like an astronaut that's scared of heights
With a heart that's beating at the speed of light
You've been waiting for this feeling all your life
Sometimes it's just hard to realize

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're stuck in a moment
And your spark has been stolen
This is our time to own it
So own it

[Chorus]
Baby, we were born with
Fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
With fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
Got lightning in a bottle
Hands on the throttle
Even in the dust we shine
With fire and gold in our eyes

[Verse 2]
There is something different about you and I
And I feel like I have known you my whole life
There is beauty behind every tear you've cried
Sometimes it's just hard to realize

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're stuck in a moment
And your spark has been stolen
This is our time to own it
So own it

[Chorus]
Baby, we were born with
Fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
With fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
Got lightning in a bottle
Hands on the throttle
Even in the dust we shine
With fire and gold in our eyes

[Bridge]
There is love inside this madness
We are walking on the moon
Though I don't believe in magic
I believe in me and you, ooh, ooh
I believe in me and you
I believe in me and you

[Chorus]
Baby, we were born with
Fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
With fire and gold in our eyes, eyes
Got lightning in a bottle
Hands on the throttle
Even in the dust we shine
With fire and gold in our eyes
