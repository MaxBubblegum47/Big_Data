[Verse 1]
After school, I always had to work
It kinda left me feeling like a jerk
Cause I never got to talk to the guy I liked
And that ain't right
And then he met another type
Made him buy her all the things she liked
I learned a lot about life
When she jumped in his convertible

[Pre-Chorus]
Singing ooh la-da-da-da
Without a care in the world
Ooh la-da-da-da
I'm not that kinda girl

[Chorus]
Rich kids got a lot to say
Rich kids never have to pay
Everything's funny when you're young with money
And mommy and daddy will pay the way
Rich kids never go to jail
Rich kids never buy on sale
Rich kids always have the most fun
Man, I wish that I was one

[Verse 2]
A little later on in life
When I finally get my money right
It's still never enough for the stuck up types
They say my money's new
And she's got a better view
As they sail away on her father's yacht
This is what I got

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh la-da-da-da
Without a care in the world
Ooh la-da-da-da
I'm not that kinda girl

[Chorus]
Rich kids got a lot to say
Rich kids never have to pay
Everything's funny when you're young with money
And mommy and daddy will pay the way
Rich kids never go to jail
Rich kids never buy on sale
Rich kids always have the most fun
Man, I wish that I was one

[Bridge]
Maybe he's not for me
Maybe he did me a favor
Maybe he saved me some trouble down the line
But maybe they're just like me
Baby, it's what they mean
Don't judge a book by the cover

[Chorus]
Rich kids got a lot to say
Rich kids never have to pay
Everything's funny when you're young with money
And mommy and daddy will pay the way
Rich kids never go to jail
Rich kids never buy on sale
Everything's funny when you're young with money
And mommy and daddy will pay the way
Rich kids never go to jail
Rich kids never buy on sale
Rich kids always have the most fun
Man, I wish that I was one
