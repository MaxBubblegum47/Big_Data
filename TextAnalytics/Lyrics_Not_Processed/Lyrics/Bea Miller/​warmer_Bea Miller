[Verse 1]
Late night, drivin', thinkin', where are we going?
Don't tell, don't ask
Go fast, headed straight for the past
My house, my room, too soon, what are we doing?
Why does this feel so good?

[Pre-Chorus]
Dim the light, close your eyes
Here again to test the water
Always fight what we find
But we search a little longer

[Chorus]
There's a truth we're second guessing
There's no use in not confessing
Never right, but tonight
Think we might be getting warmer

[Post-Chorus: Zaire Simmons]
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)

[Verse 2]
Heartbeat's racin', chasin' what it's been craving
I can't help but want it, don't know how to admit
No right time or place to open my mouth and say
Why does this feel so good?

[Pre-Chorus]
Dim the light, close your eyes
Here again to test the water
Always fight what we find
But we search a little longer

[Chorus]
There's a truth we're second guessing
There's no use in not confessing
Never right, but tonight
Think we might be getting warmer

[Post-Chorus: Zaire Simmons]
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)

[Bridge]
Warmer to us, warmer to love
Warmer to everything we came here to touch

[Pre-Chorus]
Dim the light, close your eyes
Here again to test the water
Always fight what we find
But we search a little longer

[Chorus]
There's a truth we're second guessing
There's no use in not confessing
Never right, but tonight
Think we might be getting warmer

[Post-Chorus]
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)
(Get on, we can keep it on the low)
(Get off, we can keep it on the low)
