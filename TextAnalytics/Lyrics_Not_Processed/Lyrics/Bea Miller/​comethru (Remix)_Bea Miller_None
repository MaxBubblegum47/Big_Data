[Verse 1: Jeremy Zucker]
I might lose my mind
Waking when the sun's down
Riding all these highs
Waiting for the comedown
Walk these streets with me
I'm doing decently
Just glad that I can breathe, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
I'm trying to realize
It's alright to not be fine on your own

[Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee
These last few weeks have been exhausting
I'm lost in my imagination
And there's one thing that I need from you

[Hook: Jeremy Zucker]
Can you come through, through
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you
Can you come through?

[Verse 2: Bea Miller]
Staring at the ceiling
I'm wishing for the sky
I don't know what I'm feeling
Maybe I'm just needing
Someone to pass the time

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremy Zucker & Bea Miller]
I'm trying to realize
It's alright to not be fine on your own

[Chorus: Jeremy Zucker & Bea Miller]
Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee
These last few weeks have been exhausting
I'm lost in my imagination
And there's one thing that I need from you

[Hook: Jeremy Zucker & Bea Miller,

Can you come through (
Can you come through, yeah
)
Through (
Can you come through, oh
)
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you

[Outro: Jeremy Zucker]
Can you come through, through
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you
Can you come through?
