[Verse 1]
Somebody get me a hammer
Wanna break all the clocks and the mirrors
And go back to a time that was different
A time when I didn't feel like there was something missing
Now my body and mind are so distant
Don't know how to escape from this prison

[Pre-Chorus 1]
How can I free my mind?

[Chorus]
Cause I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't breathe

[Verse 2]
How can I live in the moment
When my thoughts never feel like my own and
Don't know how to admit that I'm broken

[Pre-Chorus 2]
How can I be alright?

[Chorus]
Cause I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't breathe

[Outro]
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
