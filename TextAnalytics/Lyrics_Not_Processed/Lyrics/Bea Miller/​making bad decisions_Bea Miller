[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I am so impulsive to a fault
I want the opposite of what I got
The second I get bored, I switch it up
Makin' bad decisions based on temporary thoughts
I know they say there's greener grass
For me, it's never about that
The second I get bored, I switch it up
Makin' bad decisions based on temporary thoughts

[Verse 1]
My favorite hobby, self-sabotage
Can never seem to make my mind up
Change my opinion more than my socks

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me tell you 'bout the time I
Took my friend out the friend zone
'Cause I felt so sad sleepin' alone
Then I put him right back, just like that
'Cause I missed bein' by myself

[Chorus]
I am so impulsive to a fault
I want the opposite of what I got
The second I get bored, I switch it up
Makin' bad decisions based on temporary thoughts
I know they say there's greener grass
For me, it's never about that
The second I get bored, I switch it up
Makin' bad decisions based on temporary thoughts, oh

[Verse 2]
One day, I like you, and the next, I don't
Can never seem to make my mind up
But I can't help it, it's out of my control

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me tell you 'bout the time I
Took my friend out the friend zone
'Cause I felt so sad sleepin' alone
Then I put him right back, just like that
'Cause I missed bein' by myself

[Chorus]
I am so impulsive to a fault
I want the opposite of what I got
The second I get bored, I switch it up
Makin' bad decisions based on temporary thoughts
I know they say there's greener grass
For me, it's never about that
The second I get bored, I switch it up
Makin' bad decisions based on temporary thoughts, oh

[Outro]
I am so impulsive to a fault (I am so impulsive to a fault)
I want the opposite of what I got (The opposite of what I got)
The second I get bored, I switch it up (I switch it up, oh)
Makin' bad decisions based on temporary thoughts
I know they say there's greener grass (I know they say there's greener grass)
For me, it's never about that (Never about that)
The second I get bored, I switch it up
Makin' bad decisions based on temporary thoughts, oh
