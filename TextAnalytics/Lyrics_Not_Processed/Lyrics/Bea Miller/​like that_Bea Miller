[Verse 1]
Can see it from the way you looking at me
You don't think I'm worth your time
Don't care about the person that I might be
Offended that I walk the line

[Pre-Chorus]
So what if I'm not
So what if I'm not everything you wanted me to be?
So what if I am
So what if I am more than you can see?

[Chorus]
When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
It's pushin' me harder, it's pushin' me harder
When you breakin' my back, when you breakin' my back
I only get stronger, I only get stronger
I should've walked away one year ago
When you said I wouldn’t make it out alive
When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
I only get stronger, I only get stronger
When you treat me like that

[Verse 2]
As far as I can tell, it's kinda crazy
That you even care at all
Convincing everybody you can save me
But you're the one who made me fall

[Pre-Chorus]
So what if I'm not
So what if I'm not everything you wanted me to be?
So what if I am
So what if I am more than you can see?

[Chorus]
When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
It's pushin' me harder, it's pushin' me harder
When you breakin' my back, when you breakin' my back
I only get stronger, I only get stronger
I should've walked away one year ago
When you said I wouldn’t make it out alive
When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
I only get stronger, I only get stronger
When you treat me like that

[Bridge]
Why you wanna see me bleed?
Why you wanna watch me fall apart?
Try to find the worst in me
But I won't follow you into the dark

[Chorus]
When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
It's pushin' me harder, it's pushin' me harder
When you breakin' my back, when you breakin' my back
I only get stronger, I only get stronger
I should've walked away one year ago
When you said I wouldn’t make it out alive
When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
I only get stronger, I only get stronger
When you treat me like that
