[Verse 1]
The night we met
I knew I, I needed you so
And if I had the chance
I'd never let you go
So won't you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make 'em turn their heads
Every place we go
So won't you please

[Chorus]
Be my, be my baby
Be my little baby
My one and only baby
Say you'll be my darling
Be my, be my baby
Be my baby now
My one and only baby
Wa-oh-oh oh

[Verse 2]
I'll make you happy, baby
Just wait and see
For every kiss you give me
I'll give you three
Oh, since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you
Till eternity so won't you please

[Chorus]
Be my, be my baby
Be my little baby
My one and only baby
Say you'll be my darling
Be my, be my baby
Be my baby now
My one and only baby
Wa oh oh oh
So come on and be
Be my, be my baby
Be my little baby
My one and only
Say you'll be my darling
Be my baby now
Wa oh oh oh
Wa oh oh oh
(Be my, be my baby) Be my little baby
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Wa oh oh oh
Be my little baby
Whoah my darling
Baby, now
Wa oh oh oh
