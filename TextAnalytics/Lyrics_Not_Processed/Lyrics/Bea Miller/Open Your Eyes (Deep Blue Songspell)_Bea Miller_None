(Woah woahhh
Wooooah oh oh)
Water and light
This is us
History falling down
Hope rising up
We're the here and now
All that came before
Can not stay asleep
We're not children anymore
(Oh oh ohhhh)

We can fight the dark
This is who we are
There's a new light coming
Finally had enough
Finally waking up
To who we are becoming
Open your eyes!
(Oh oh ohhhh
Woahhh woooah)
Open your eyes!

Will you be my love
Will you go with me
Are you who I dreamed?
Or just a memory
Will you understand
What I have to do
Will you be the man
The one I thought I knew
(Oh oh ohhhh)

We can fight the dark
This is who we are
There's a new light coming
Finally had enough
Finally waking up
To who we are becoming
Open your eyes!
(Oh oh ohhhh
Woahhh woooah)
Open your eyes!

Into the deep blue
We'll do this together
Water and fire
Reach higher
There's no turning back
(Oh oh ohhhh)

We can fight the dark
This is who we are
There's a new light coming
Finally had enough
Finally waking up
To who we are becoming
Open your eyes! (Open your eyes)
(Oh oh ohhhh
Woahhh woooah)
Open your eyes! (Open your eyes)
(Oh oh ohhhh
Woahhh woooah)
