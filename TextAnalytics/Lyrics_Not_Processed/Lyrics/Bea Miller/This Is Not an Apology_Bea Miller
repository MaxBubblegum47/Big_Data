[Verse 1]
I like it loud, you turn it down
You wanna talk, but what about?
I wanna dance, you cut me off
Who falls asleep at ten o clock?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't got no sympathy
Don't wipe your tears on me
I hate to be so mean
But I just have to say

[Chorus]
This is not an apology
I'm just a little bit stronger than you
This is not an apology
You're such a chick, it makes me feel like a dude
My finger's up, I've had enough
You're going down, so say goodbye to us
This is not an apology, ay
This is not an apology

[Verse 2]
I was the girl lain in the dirt
Rather ripped up jeans than a mini skirt
Don't need two hours to get out the door
You're supposed to be the guy, who do you need more?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't got no sympathy
Don't wipe your tears on me
I hate to be so mean
But I just have to say

[Chorus]
This is not an apology
I'm just a little bit stronger than you
This is not an apology
You're such a chick, it makes me feel like a dude
My finger's up, I've had enough
You're going down, so say goodbye to us
This is not an apology, ay

[Bridge]
And I never will be the girl who says sorry
And you should have known right from the start
I needed a hero, and I got a zero, so pack your bags
And take your broken heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
This is not an apology
I'm just a little bit stronger than you
This is not an apology
You're such a chick, it makes me feel like a dude
My finger's up, I've had enough
You're going down, so say goodbye to us
This is not an apology, ay
This is not an apology
I'm just a little bit stronger than you
This is not an apology
You're such a chick, it makes me feel like a dude
My finger's up, I've had enough
You're going down, so say goodbye to us
This is not an apology, ay
This is not an apology
