[Verse 1]
This whole thing started so that fathers could sell daughters like property
But I never had a father and I couldn't be his daughter so lucky me
The only thing I'm sellin' are songs
But nobody buys those no more
Marriage is a contract 'cause they know that it's another liability
You cut through my legs, through my heart just to get another piece of me (Piece of me)
The only thing I'm servin' are facts
But nobody wants those no more

[Chorus]
Hey (Oh-oh, mmm)
See, the thing about forever (Oh-oh)
Is that it's a fucking lie (Oh-oh)
But I'll lovе you for tonight (Oh-oh, mmm)
Say with time that it gets bettеr (Oh-oh)
And that's such a fucking lie (Oh-oh)
But I'll love you for to—night, oh (Oh)

[Verse 2]
I've been tryna wean myself off people who are heteronormative
And we should be arrested 'cause we're saying words like that in pop music
The only things I'm sayin' are facts
But nobody wants those no more
Sorry that I'm bein' emo, oh

[Chorus]
Hey (Oh-oh, mmm)
See, the thing about forever (Oh-oh)
Is that it's a fucking lie (Oh-oh)
But I'll love you for tonight (Oh-oh, mmm)
Say with time that it gets better (Oh-oh)
And that's such a fucking lie (Oh-oh)
But I'll love you for tonight

[Outro]
I'll love you, love you, love you for tonight (Love you for tonight)
I'll love you, love you, love you for tonight (Love you for tonight)
I'll love you, love you, love you for tonight
But I can't promise tomorrow
