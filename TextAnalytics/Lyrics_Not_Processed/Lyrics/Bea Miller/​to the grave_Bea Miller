[Verse 1: Bea Miller]
I got my bed sheets pulled right out from under me
I can't keep hiding what's been underneath
No fancy covering, you get just what you see

[Pre-Chorus: Bea Miller]
You get, you get, you get
You get, you get, you get
You get, you get

[Chorus: Bea Miller]
Breaking down, let the words fall from my mouth
All the things I've never shown, all the things you'd never know
Hear me out 'cause I never made the sound
Couldn't keep it locked away, couldn't take it to the grave

[Verse 2: Bea Miller]
Was feeling empty, feeling with uncertainty
I couldn't be left inside a room with me
Now I believe running only gets you where you see

[Pre-Chorus: Bea Miller]
You get, you get, you get
You get, you get, you get
You get, you get

[Chorus: Bea Miller]
Breaking down, let the words fall from my mouth
All the things I've never shown, all the things you'd never know
Hear me out 'cause I never made the sound
Couldn't keep it locked away, couldn't take it to the grave

[Verse 3: mike.]
Yeah, I've been careless, I've been thoughtless
I know that I'm a work in progress
My heart's chaotic, empty bottles
I, yeah, I just sip this drink 'til it's alright
I stay ready for anything, yeah, and I put that on everything, yeah
Tellin' me I should let it be, nah, that ain't part of my pedigree
'Cause oh my god, they wanna bury me alive
I'm so gone, there ain't no saving me tonight
And I can't leave 'til I say what I gotta say
Or I'ma take all this dirt to my grave

[Bridge: Bea Miller]
I never thought I'd give it all away, but I set myself free
I never thought I'd give it all away, but I need you to see I'm

[Chorus: Bea Miller]
Breaking down, let the words fall from my mouth
All the things I've never shown, all the things you'd never know
Hear me out 'cause I never made the sound
Couldn't keep it locked away, couldn't take it to the grave
