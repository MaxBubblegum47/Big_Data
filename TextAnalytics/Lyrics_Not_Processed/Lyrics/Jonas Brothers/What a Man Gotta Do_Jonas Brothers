[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Cut my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the Earth and lose the fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours, all yours

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
You ain't trying to be wasting time
On stupid people and cheap lines I'm sure, I'm sure
So I‘d give a million dollars just for you to grab me by the collar
And knock on these doors, these doors

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for the full-time, I'm yours, I'm yours, woo!

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me what a man gotta do

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
So, what a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do, yeah?)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta say? (What a man gotta say?)
What a man gotta pray? (What a man gotta pray?)
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day" (Ayy)
So, what a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do? (Woah)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta do? (Hey, baby)
What a man gotta prove? (What a man gotta prove?)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
