[Intro: Nick Jonas]
I'm feeling so cool
From top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Well, dammit, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
I'm feelin' high like a late night summer of last year (Yeah)
Standin' there with the red dress on ya
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me or am I just havin' a good year?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
Dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Must've done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
When I grow up, I wanna be just like me

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Cool
