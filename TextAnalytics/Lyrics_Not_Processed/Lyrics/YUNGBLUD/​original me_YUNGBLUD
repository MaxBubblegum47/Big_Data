[Intro: YUNGBLUD]
Yeah

[Verse 1: YUNGBLUD, 
Dan Reynolds
 & 
Both
]
I'm so sick of me, wake up and hate to breathe
And I pride myself in that, so dramatic, I’ll admit
I'm so typical, my life ain't difficult
But I’m so caught up in it, just a lowlife, I'll admit
I'm self-critical, a tryhard original
Oh, I pride myself on that, such a loser, I'll admit

[Pre-Chorus: YUNGBLUD 
with Dan Reynolds
]
And I ask myself, when my time will come
Will I run away, 
will I run away?

[Chorus: YUNGBLUD & Dan Reynolds]
I'm the original loser
Some days, I wish I's anyone else
I'm the original loser
Some days, I wish I's anyone else

[Verse 2: YUNGBLUD, 
Dan Reynolds
 & 
Both
]
I’m so paranoid, most people I avoid
Not seeking sympathy (Nah), I just want out of this (Hey)
Hide under an umbrella (
Yeah
)
And try to shelter 
myself from the rain
Try to stop my head from 
goin’ insane
Counting down 
all the days
I swear that there's a 
bright side too
Being alone 
outside
, they
Cannot suffo
cate me when they
Cannot 
fucking chase me out
 (
Ayy
)
Anagram all of the letters
They’re tellin' me that I'm gonna be fine
I climb the walls inside of my mind
Piece 'em together and jump off the sides
I might be alone tonight
If I try to stay alive and realise
I’m going blind

[Chorus: YUNGBLUD & Dan Reynolds]
(
Congratulations
) I'm the original loser
Some days, I wish I's anyone else
(
Congratulations
) I'm the original loser
Some days, I wish I's anyone else

[Bridge: YUNGBLUD & 
Dan Reynolds
]
Don't let 'em change your mind
Don't let 'em change your mind (
Ooh
)
Don't let 'em waste your time
Don't let 'em waste your time (
Someone save me
)
Don't let 'em change your mind
Don't let 'em change your mind (
Loser
, fuck)
Don't let 'em waste your time
Don't let 'em waste your time
Yeah
Don't let 'em waste your time

[Chorus: YUNGBLUD & Dan Reynolds, 
Dan Reynolds
]
I'm the original loser (
Congratulations
)
Some days, I wish I's anyone else (
Loser
)
