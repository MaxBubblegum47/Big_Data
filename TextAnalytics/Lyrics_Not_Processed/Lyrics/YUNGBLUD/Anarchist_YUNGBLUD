[Verse 1]
Locked me in a room since I was young
I've never seen a fucking sun come up
I'm employee of the month at a Ritalin club
Yeah, why do you think I'm so messed up?

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't know where I am, I don't know where I am
I don't know where I am
I don't know where I am, don't know where I am
Don't know where I am

[Chorus]
They said I'm an ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids
Ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids

[Verse 2]
'Cause they took my favourite old game set
And then they pawned my toys for a Percocet
And then they tied up a toaster to my head
And then they chucked me off a cliff but I'm still not dead

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't know where I am, I don't know where I am
I don't know where I am
I don't know where I am, don't know where I am
Don't know where I am

[Chorus]
They said I'm an ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids
Ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids
Ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids
Ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids

[Bridge]
La-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da

[Chorus]
They said I'm an ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids
Ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids
Ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids
Ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids
Ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids
Ana-ana-anarchist, I'm an anarchist
Ana-ana-anarchist, not like the other kids
