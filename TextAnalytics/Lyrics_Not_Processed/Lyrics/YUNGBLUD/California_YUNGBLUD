[Verse 1]
Got cuts on your eyes
Preachin' to me sayin' you sympathise
Misunderstanding, I am alright
It's you that needs the glasses
Why can't you see?
That I am okay, you take more drugs than me
Chewing your cheek
I can't believe you put me in a straight jacket

[Pre-Chorus]
They tried to put me on Ritalin (Ritalin)
Visions of calming me down
They tried to put me on Ritalin (Ritalin)
Hopin' I don't make a sound

[Chorus]
Maybe I just need to go to California
'Cause I am young, don't wanna die yet, can't afford it
Maybe I just need to go to California

[Post-Chorus]
Swear that when I get old, you'll blow all my brains out
Swear that when I get old, you'll blow all my brains out
(Blow my brains out!)
(Blow my brains out!)

[Verse 2]
I don't understand
How I can respect you when you're such a twat (Woo)
What you shocked at? It's a matter of fact
And usually, I would listen to you
But when my future's involved, I got a responsibility to sit down
And think what I should do
Shout, "Fuck him and fuck her and fuck you too" (What?)

[Pre-Chorus]
They tried to put me on Ritalin (Ritalin)
Visions of calming me down
They tried to put me on Ritalin (Ritalin)
Hopin' I don't make a sound (Brrap, brrap)
They tried to put me on Ritalin (Ritalin)
Visions of calming me down
They tried to put me on Ritalin (Ritalin)
Hopin' I don't make a sound

[Chorus]
Maybe I just need to go to California
'Cause I am young, don't wanna die yet, can't afford it
Maybe I just need to go to California

[Post-Chorus]
Swear that when I get old, you'll blow all my brains out
Swear that when I get old, you'll blow all my brains out
(Blow my brains out!)
(Yeah, blow my brains out)

[Bridge]
Rip my heart up
And pull it out of my chest
Rip my heart up
And pull it out of my chest
Rip my heart up
And pull it out of my chest
Rip my heart up
And pull it out of my chest!

[Outro]
Maybe I just need to go to California
'Cause I am young, don't wanna die yet, can't afford it
Maybe I just need to go to California
Swear that when I get old, you'll blow all my brains out
Maybe I just need to go to California
'Cause I am young, don't wanna die yet, can't afford it
Maybe I just need to go to California
Swear that when I get old, you'll blow all my brains out
Swear that when I get old, you'll blow all my brains out!
