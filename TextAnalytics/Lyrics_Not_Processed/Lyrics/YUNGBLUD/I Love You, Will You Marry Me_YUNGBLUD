[Chorus]
(Park Hill romance) We got the love but they put out the fire
(Park Hill romance) 'Cause they expect us to walk on the wire
(Park Hill romance) We got the love but they put out the fire
(Park Hill romance) 'Cause they expect us to walk on the wire

[Verse 1]
A kid lifts up a spray can
And never thought it would be famous, what he did
Turned a mess into a dreamland
With a quirky act of romance
A version of Romeo and Juliet
This time with Adidas sneakers and cigarettes
"A couple of kids trying to cut down the safety net"
They twisted the story so they could bring glory to it

[Pre-Chorus]
I love ya, will you marry me?
Oh, what a shame we gotta pay for reality
Ain't it sad, sad, sad?

[Chorus]
(Park Hill romance) We got the love but they put out the fire
(Park Hill romance) 'Cause they expect us to walk on the wire
(Park Hill romance) We got the love but they put out the fire
(Park Hill romance) 'Cause they expect us to walk on the wire

[Verse 2]
They didn't write her name on the article
That to me just seems pretty farcical
Now coppers, take coppers
Out of his hands from a ban from alcohol
Fundamental narcissist
Tried to make out he didn't exist
When they wrote on the, what?
When they wrote on the
T-shirts, cool merch, postcards
And lighting it up like a piece of art
They kicked him to the side and left him to starve
On the memory that's re-breaking his broken heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I love ya, will you marry me?
Oh, what a shame we gotta pay for reality
Ain't it sad, sad, sad?
(Hey!) I love ya, will you marry me?
Oh, what a shame we gotta pay for reality (Hey!)
Ain't it sad, sad, sad?

[Bridge]
Every day (Every day), day, day (Every single day)
Day, day, day, day, day, day, day
Every day (Every day), day, day (Every single day)
Day, day, day, day, day, day, day

[Pre-Chorus]
I love ya, will you marry me?
Oh, what a shame we gotta pay for reality
Ain't it sad, sad, sad?
(Hey!) I love ya, will you marry me?
Oh, what a shame we gotta pay for reality
Ain't it sad, sad, sad?

[Chorus]
(Park Hill romance) We got the love but they put out the fire
(Park Hill romance) 'Cause they expect us to walk on the wire
(Park Hill romance) We got the love but they put out the fire
(Park Hill romance) 'Cause they expect us to walk on the wire
(Park Hill romance)
