[Verse 1: Forrest]
Woke up early in the mornin'
Just to feel the light of day
Had to open up my window
Get the shadows out my way
Banana pancakes for my problems
Find me jamming old Jack Johnson
Swear I heard them angel calls
Lay outside

[Chorus: Forrest]
As Heaven falls
Heaven falls
Heaven fa-a-a-alls
As Heaven falls
Heaven falls
Heaven fa-a-all down on me

[Verse 2: Forrest]
Nothin quite like all this color
Couldn't paint a better day
Got good times on the horizon
I can see them on their way
Couple birds came up beside me
Had to feed em some Bob Marley
Swear I heard them angel calls
Lay outside

[Chorus: Forrest]
As Heaven falls
Heaven falls
Heaven fa-a-a-alls
As Heaven falls
Heaven falls
Heaven fa-a-all down on me

[Chorus: Forrest]
Heaven falls
Heaven falls
Heaven fa-a-a-alls
As Heaven falls
Heaven falls
Heaven fa-a-all down on me

[Outro: Forrest]
Fall on me
Fall on me
Fall on me
Fall on me
Fall on me
Fall on me
Fall on me
Fall on me
