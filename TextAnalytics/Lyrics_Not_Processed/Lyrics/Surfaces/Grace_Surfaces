[Chorus: Forrest]
Oh Grace, oh Grace
Every time you come around
I feel ok, you help me see color in a world of grey
Girl, you make me feel some type of way, ooh

[Verse 1: Forrest]
Every little thing you say or you do
Got me feeling like everything is brand new
I just sit and wonder why
I can't believe that I'm your guy
Just say my name and I'll come through

[Chorus: Forrest]
Oh Grace, oh Grace
Everytime you come around
I feel ok, you help me see color in a world of grey
Girl, you make me feel some type of way, ooh

[Verse 2: Forrest]
Ain't no mystery that we can't solve with you and me
There ain't no other place I'd rather be that I can see
I love the way you move
There's nothing that you have to prove
Just say my name and I'll come through

[Chorus: Forrest]
Oh Grace, oh Grace
Everytime you come around
I feel ok, you help me see color in a world of grey
Girl, you make me feel some type of way, ooh

[Outro: Forrest]
Oh Grace, oh Grace (Woo!)
You make me feel some type of way
Oh Grace, oh Grace (Woo!)
You make me feel some type of way
