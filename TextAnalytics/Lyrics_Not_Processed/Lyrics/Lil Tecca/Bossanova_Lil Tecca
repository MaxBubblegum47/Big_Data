[Intro]
Yeah, oh my, oh my God
Oh my, oh my God, oh my
Oh my, oh my God, oh my
Oh my (uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
(Nick, you're stupid)
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)

[Chorus]
My baby, she flexin' all up on my blessings
I get a flash, nigga with baguettes (Yeah)
We just seen a opp and we sent 'em to heaven (Yeah)
And it been so long, so the vibe so distant
She say I'm Lil' Tecca, so she let me hit it (Uh, uh)
Ain't respond to the text, nigga but I read it
She told me she love me, nigga had to dead it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, run to the pack, lil' nigga gotta get it
I don't know, are you gang, slime?
I don't know your gang sign
I don't know your intentions wit' my energy, see you later
She said "oh my God" like Lil Keed (Oh my)
And you givin' me stress, baby I don't need (Oh my)
She said that she love me, she fuck with my team (Oh my, oh my)
How you say that you love me and fuck on my team? (Oh my)

[Verse]
I'm countin' the cash, yeah I count the green (Green, cash)
I'm countin' the cash, yeah I count the blue (Count the blue)
I got no pressure, nigga game two
You know that you poppin' if they hate you
I use it as motivation, 'cause I know that I'm going to be greatness (Motivation)
Spin the block like tornado
You a lost nigga, you are outdated
Put me in Olympics, I run to that sack (Sack)
I feel like a doctor she give me that back
I said, "Yo Wave, pass the MAC" (MAC)
Finnessin' that pack and I might get it back (Finesse)
Always grindin', nigga I cannot slack
I fucked your bitch, ha, that's a fact (Thotty)
I fucked yo' ho, nigga that's a fendi (Schemin')
I mixed the Prada nigga wit' the Fendi
I fuck on yo' bitch her name Betty (Betty)
You fall in love then it's deady (Deady)
'Cause I don't need no one, I don't know if I'm ready
I ain't goin' to the party baby, we goin' to the getty
I ain't tryna' touch you baby, shawty you jus' met me

[Chorus]
My baby, she flexin' all up on my blessings
I get a flash, nigga with baguettes
We just seen a opp and we sent 'em to heaven
And it been so long, so the vibe so distant
She say I'm Lil' Tecca, so she let me hit it
Ain't respond to the text, nigga but I read it
She told me she love me, nigga had to dead it
Yeah, run to the pack, lil' nigga gotta get it
I don't know, are you gang, slime?
I don't know your gang sign
I don't know your intentions wit' my energy, see you later
She said "Oh my God" like Lil Keed (Oh my)
And you givin' me stress, baby I don't need (Oh my)
She said that she love me, she fuck on my team (Oh my)
How you say that you love me and fuck on my team? (Oh my)

[Outro]
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
