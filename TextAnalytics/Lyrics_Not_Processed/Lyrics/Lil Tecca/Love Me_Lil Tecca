[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I know you see the drip and you like it
Wanna text me, but your pride tryna fight it
I know you young, chasin' love, tryna find it
Then I saw you at a party, started wildin'

[Chorus]
I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I'on wanna fall in love, I'on think it's for me
Hope you know I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I'on wanna fall in love, I'on think it's for me

[Verse]
I ain't no regular nigga
When we pull up to the party, man, the party get bigger
And she fuckin' with Lil Tecca 'cause she know I'm a winner
I pray to God every day, but I know I'm a sinner
More money, more problems, and the bitches get thicker
Deep throat, shootin' like a free throw
Shawty, she a freak ho, that's my line
Yeah, I'm on a shawty right now, I know you mine now
But I ain't tryna waste no time
She know I'm too wavy
Yeah, I'm that nigga, you cannot replace me
As soon as I met you, you said you wan' date me
I can't say I'm loyal, for you? Baby, maybe
These niggas they hate me 'cause they mad they ain't me
So much hoes around me, I'm getting so lazy
I fuck with you, baby, as long as you make me
Sooner or later, I'll make you my baby
Sooner or later, I'll make you my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I know you see the drip and you like it
Wanna text me, but your pride tryna fight it
I know you young, chasin' love, tryna find it
Then I saw you at a party, started wildin'

[Chorus]
Hope you know I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I'on wanna fall in love, I'on think it's for me
Hope you know I want you, so do you want me?
If I said I love you, would you love me?
I could never dub you, but could you dub me?
I'on wanna fall in love, I'on think it's for me

[Outro]
I'on think it's for me
I'on think it's for me
I'on think it's for me
I'on think it's for me
