Told her, "Hit my jack," and when she hit me, told her, "Hold up"

All you gotta do is love me for me, girl

I'm sick of actin' like everything's okay when it's not good

In the two-seater, my shawty playin' shotgun
But I need somebody, 'body, yeah
Niggas movin' wocky, wocky, yeah
My car key got a button to start it
I don't think A Boogie really fuckin' with Artist
The king of the jungle in the 'Rari, yeah
Don't be lyin', I know you fuckin' somebody else
But, hey, big thottie, you like to party, yeah
But don't you call me my nickname, don't call me Artie, yeah
