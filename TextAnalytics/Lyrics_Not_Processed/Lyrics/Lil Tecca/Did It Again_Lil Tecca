[Intro]
We love you, Tecca

[Chorus]
I got a pack, hit 'em and do it again
Fuck it, I'm fuckin' her friend
I got bands, one day I'm flying to France
Juggin' 'til a nigga land
You got a man, know what I do to ya mans?
No I ain't shootin' the hands, took an L, I ain't took one again
Crashed the 'Rari so I hopped in the Benz
So, ooooh, it's crazy how they watch a young nigga gon' move
It's crazy, worry about yourself nigga, make a move
You steady watchin' all the winnin' niggas, you gon' lose
I don't gotta prove, you steady watchin' all the winnin' niggas
You gon' lose, I will never lose

[Verse]
Flyin' my mom to Japan, flyin' my dad to Japan, we in a Benz
We gon' link up with the fam, yeah I'm talkin' MBM, yeah yeah
Buddy I don't ever lack, the choppa make a nigga dance
Versatile, freelance, fuck any bitch nigga, it depends
Only with the shits if you a 10, pickin' any bitch, yeah I'm the man
If you want a feature, give me a grand
Drip on my body, I'm cool like a fan
I can not lose, I was up grindin', they snooze
Fuck all the fightin', be cool
Fuck all the dyin', keep tools

[Chorus]
I got a pack, hit 'em and do it again
Fuck it, I'm fuckin' her friend
I got bands, one day I'm flying to France
Juggin' 'til a nigga land
You got a man, know what I do to ya mans?
No I ain't shootin' the hands, took an L, I ain't took one again
Crashed the 'Rari so I hopped in the Benz
So, ooooh, it's crazy how they watch a young nigga gon' move
It's crazy, worry about yourself nigga, make a move
You steady watchin' all the winnin' niggas, you gon' lose
I don't gotta prove, you steady watchin' all the winnin' niggas
You gon' lose, I will never lose
