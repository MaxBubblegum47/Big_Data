[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
That lil' bitch a diva, fuck and leave her
My life is a movie directed by Tarantino
Shawty is a dancer, I'm not talking Billie Jean, ho
Oh, woah, fuck, we know, I swear I hate these hoes
We know shawty is an eater
We know, uh, why she wanna see us
We know that she wanna be us
Oh, woah, fuck, we know, I swear I hate these hoes

[Verse 1: Lil Tecca]
Yeah, you know (You know), yeah, we know (We know)
Sike, you don't know (You don't know)
Keep it on the low-low (Yeah)
Told a nigga, "Lay low" (Lay low)
Seven digits on the payroll (Seven on the payroll)
Speakin' Guapenese to Guapo, ayy (Guap)
Skrrt off, Tahoe with the tint, though (Top, top)
I don't want no friends, though (At all)
I don't trust many men, ayy (Many men)
And I got a small circle, it's me and many bands
I got a pack and I did it again
I ain't gon' lie, I ain't go to France
Young nigga been busy, I didn't get a chance (Chance)
Glizzy finna hit him, make a nigga dance (Dance)
And shawty, she a diva (Diva), she a diva (Diva)
Got stripes like a cheetah (Cheetah), like art, Mona Lisa (Lisa)
And we shootin' a movie, that's my life, I could teach ya
Never lie, don't mean to preach her
They talk, don't believe 'em

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
That lil' bitch a diva, fuck and leave her
My life is a movie directed by Tarantino (Tarantino)
Shawty is a dancer, I'm not talking Billie Jean, ho
Oh, woah, fuck, we know, I swear I hate these hoes
We know shawty is an eater
We know, uh, why she wanna see us
We know that she wanna be us

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI & Lil Tecca]
Me and Tecca goin' crazy
Gettin' money, but it don't phase me
And I got your bitch, wanna Face me?
She been a dub lately
Shit changed, but it ain't change me
I show up to the show and they pay me
Gettin' drip, I might skrrt to the Macy's
Counting rackades, a nigga get lazy
"Band man, band man," yeah, that's what they call me
23 should be all on my back the way that I be ballin'
All these signs of me everywhere, lil' nigga, I ain't want it
Lowkey, yeah, I want it, your bitch, yeah, she want it

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
That lil' bitch a diva, fuck and leave her
My life is a movie directed by Tarantino (Yeah)
Shawty is a dancer, I'm not talking Billie Jean, ho
Oh, woah, fuck, we know, I swear I hate these hoes
We know shawty is an eater
We know, uh, why she wanna see us
We know that she wanna be us
Oh, woah, fuck, we know, I swear I hate these hoes
