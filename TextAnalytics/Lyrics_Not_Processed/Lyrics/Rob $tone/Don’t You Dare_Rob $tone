[Verse 1: Rob $tone]
I be like whoop I'ma hop out on you niggas at the light
I caught ya disrespectin' now it's obviously on sight
I be like don't ya dare
I know you scared and I ain't come to fight
My pistol's better
Never cared if niggas think it's right
Oh yeah you fuckin' ride them nicely
Yeah, My fuckin' diamonds bright
My car straight out of Heists and I fuck Asian girls for rice
I be like don't you dare
You niggas square, new bitch up for the night
You don't compare
What's in the air, my situation right
Just knocked a new bitch
Just popped a new tag
Just copped a new whip and only let my bitch drive
Man I just whoop cash
Just spit the truth out
Still burn the doob down to put it on the bitch mouth
Man I'm the truth huh
You niggas fruit snacks

I look like who's Rob?
You bitches need a new job

[Verse 2: Mitchy Slick]
Versace, Versace, usually
But i been ?? and got this from Mario's
It really don't matter when you this slum in the jump
And in one of these sorry hoes
Debby double tappin' on a homie's shit
And wonder why they always lonely and shit
Told her to meet me at the Limit at a quarter to 8
Pulled up in some shit that look like you need to be up in space
Shoulda seen her face
Look like she seen a ghost
I think she know how many dead presidents it take to get up in her (?)
She asked if she could hit the trick joint, I said I don't care
She tried to blast me on Snapchat, I said don't you dare
She asked if we could go to LA to get some chicken and waffles
I cussed the bitch out and told her this daygo and  ordered us some some rolled tacos
