Ain't no competition even though they try they hardest
I know they be hating, but I'm in my bag regardless (Flex)
Give this shit a year or two let's see who get the farthest
Don't play in these streets before you turn into a target (Boom, boom, boom)
You could think you crazy but my shorties get retarded

Caught yo homie lacking- (Bop, knocked off his dread)
Just a satisfaction we'll come take off a nigga head (Haha)
Hollows like a deadly virus, bodies drop when that shit spread
Explode in his flesh, make a mess, get ripped to shreds
Show no mercy for the enemy nobody getting spared
