[Verse 1: Polo G & 
Stunna 4 Vegas
]
Hit the strip after school, couldn't wait 'til I got out of class, used to stare at the clock and shit
Before all of this rappin' shit, I was gangbangin' and doin' high-speeds on the cops and shit
And I'm straight from the Chi, but I ball like a king up in Cali and shoot like Stojaković
Keep applyin' that pressure, I go on the run, it ain't no lettin' it up, ain't no stoppin' this
Had to tell my lil' brother to chill, gotta stay in the house, come outside, he be poppin' shit
You ain't heard about us, well, you need to go watch the news, niggas know we be dropping shit
Got the feds on my ass in the hood 'cause they think I'm the one who been buyin' up Glocks and shit
I'm just focused on music, they say my last tape was a classic, but I got some hotter shit (Hotter shit)
Might be rocking a show or if I'm not up the stu', then I'm fucking this cash off
Don't you know Polo G? Skinny tall with the dreads, that lil' nigga be rappin' his ass off
Yeah, I heard she got surgery, still wanna clap from the back just to see if her ass soft
Go like Harden with rockets, we blast off
Tried to throw us some bullets, but we made 'em fumble, like nah, you ain't gettin' that pass off
Spin the block, now I'm takin' my mask off
Hit the gas like we racin', speed off in them foreigns and leave tire marks on the asphalt
It's gon' be R.I.P. once your ass caught
He like frontin', we knockin' his cap off
'Nother day, a new chain or a MAC bought
All this ice got me freezin' like Jack Frost (
4X
)

[Verse 2: Stunna 4 Vegas & 
NLE Choppa
]
That boy a bitch, that's his dad fault
If you play, then you lay, we can crash out (Let's go)
When I up in his shit, bet it's man down (Boom)
In BOA, I'm pullin' them bands out (Cash)
DOA, bitch, I get your mans off (Gone)
A rockstar from the block, I stand out (Uh)
Came from nothing, I fucked my advance off
When I hit the game, with my flow, niggas ran off (No cap), fuck it
I'm not your average joe (Uh-uh)
When I leave the house, I tuck it, uh (Fire, fire)
I'm rich, I don't shop on no budget
He clutchin', my lil' youngin want him a bucket, uh (Score)
I hop on this bitch and run it (Uh)
If I said it, I seen it or done it (Uh, uh)
These lil' niggas never robbed nobody
Ain't caught no body, and ain't getting no money (Cap)
Where I'm from, it's sports or gunplay
We looked up to the killer and dealers
But even them niggas wan' make it out one day (On gang)
Fuck my first M, I been had hood fame (Yeah)
Took off like I was on a runway (Yoom)
I'm a star, but still post on the one way (Blatt)
Them niggas talk, but they won't play (
NLE
)
We let them guns sing like the choir on Sunday (
Yeah, yeah
)

[Verse 3: NLE Choppa]
Hop on the scene and I'm thuggin'
This Glock on my hip, so you know that I'm clutchin'
Catch me an opp, I'ma down him in public
The police keep askin', I'm changin' the subject
The way I grew up, man, a nigga was rugged
Why the fuck you got a gun? You not gonna bust it
And a hundred some shots, I ain't doin' no tustlin'
Give a nigga temptation like he David Ruffin
I ain't gon' cap, I don't even like rappin'
But I love wrappin' them bodies and shit
Fuck the bitch, and when I get done
I'ma up my Glock and then rob the bitch
Catch a nigga when he clock out
I'ma get him whacked at his job and shit
And I don't know why the police keep fuckin' with me
'Cause they ain't stoppin' shit, yeah
Spin on your block like a remix
Shoot him in the face, get his teeth lit
Extended clip like a broomstick
Shoot a flick like Netflix
Scratch an opp off the checklist
I just bought a gun off Craigslist
Shoot an opp in the brain, I'm leavin' a stain, only thing you see is red shit
If the police behind, we keep duckin'
My gun need some drawers, it got nuts
Whole gang, we strapped, don't test us
If a nigga play, he gon' get bust, yeah
NLE the Top Shotta, don dada
Got the bombs like Al-Qaeda
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
