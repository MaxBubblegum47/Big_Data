[Chorus]
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hangin' with the members, then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people dyin' and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side, but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grindin' for a new life

[Verse 1]
Hard headed, I grew up resilient
It wasn't no heroes, so we looked up to the villains
For generations, bitch, my side of town been drillin'
We been at war ever since them red buildings
It's hard to make peace once blood get to spillin', ayy
Lil Wooski get to shootin' like he filmin'
Yeah, my friends died too, I know that feeling
I'm poppin' ecstasy to help me with the healin'
Leia and lil' baby my younger siblings
I really love 'em, so I treat 'em like my children
Leilani told me stack them bands to the ceiling
I switched my swag up, can't you tell the difference?
I'm finna feed the whole gang with these millions
I'm finna buy my whole hood with these millions
Girl, if I give you my time, that's a privilege
But I can only give my heart to the realest

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hangin' with the members, then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people dyin' and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side, but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grindin' for a new life

[Verse 2]
Lately, I've been feelin' like fuck the streets, this shit a scam
These days, if it ain't 'bout money, I don't give a damn
I'm just gon' get rich and fuck them plastic hoes on Instagram
Still with the gang though, one false move, them killers blam
Still on that same block for those who say they look for me
I ain't sacrifice the shit I lost, it was took from me
Almost went insane, went insane, went insane
From all this pain, all this pain, all this pain
Turned that pain into passion and made it happen
Shout out to the ones who doubted me, they keep me laughin'
Sippin' on this codeine got me relaxin'
She say she like how I be swaggin', she love my fashion
VVS my diamonds, my jewelry flashin'
Drip so hard, I'm makin' puddles, bitch, my Gucci splashin'
Fresh to death like my closet in the casket
Fresh to death like my closet in the casket

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hangin' with the members then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people dyin' and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side, but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grindin' for a new life

[Outro]
Ayy, grindin' for a new life
Grindin' for a new life
Grindin' for a new life, ayy
