[Chorus: Cochise]
Hey, hey, can a nigga, can a nigga slip it in?
I just wanna, I wanna slip it in
I just wanna, let a nigga slip it in
Why you actin' like this?
Don't come to my crib thinkin' that, we just gon' chill
You threw on Netflix, you listen to my music
Just let a nigga smash please!
Let me smash!
Let me smash!
Stop playin' bitch, let a nigga smash
I see them thighs bitch I see that ass
Let a nigga smash!
Let a nigga smash!
Let a nigga smaaaaash!
Let a nigga beat up on them booty cheeks, bruise up them booty cheeks, eat up on them booty cheeks, defeat them booty cheeks
Bitch stop playing with me, I'm tryna fuck, yeah, I'm tryna fuck
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god (DBangz, can you eat my ass?)

[Verse: Dbangz]
I got a million on YouTube, like holy fuck I'm blowing up
I got a million in the bank, I got a million toes to suck
I got a million ugly bitches on my dick they tryna fuck
I got a million busty niggas in my room they made me bust
Niggas in my comments hatin' what the fuck is up?
I got a dollar in my bank I asked for 30 water cups
I put the Sprite up in that bitch no purple syrup that I mix
And I'm dusty as the fuck 'cause almost all my shoes are ripped
I do ollies like a bitch don't play me skate I'm finna lose
Told your bitch pull out her booty or them toes I let her choose
Lil Cumstain suck your belly button go 'head spread the news
And I'm comin' outta Phoenix and my niggas comin' too (no homo)
Bitches on my dick and they all got autism
Bitches on my dick and they all got autism
Bitches on my dick and they all got autism
Bitches on my dick and they all got autism
Vaseline lotion on my desk I get to jackin'
Bitch I'm young DBangz I'll grasp your toes I'm with the action
Dykes up in my whip don't try no shit they pistol packin'
Keep a loaded .45 up in her titties bitch what's happenin'?

[Outro: Cochise]
Hey, hey, can a nigga, can a nigga slip it in?
I just wanna, I wanna slip it in
I just wanna, let a nigga slip it in
Why you actin' like this?
Don't come to my crib thinkin' that, we just gon' chill
You threw on Netflix, you listen to my music
Just let a nigga smash please!
Let me smash!
Let me smash!
