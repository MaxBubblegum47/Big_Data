When I'm runnin', I can never slip (Slip)
When they see me, wanna take a flick (Flick)
So much shawties, I can't even pick (Pick)
But I picked already, so don't trip (Don't trip)

Hеard he in the party gettin' kicked (Kicked, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Cochise]
Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah
I might go kick it like FIFA (Yeah)
I got the blonde in my hair like Vegeta (Ice)
Ice on my wrist like I'm workin' at Rita's
Stripes on the socks, on my chest is a beater (Yeah)
Juice in the cup, I don't pour up the liter (Yeah)
Bake in the crib, I ain't talkin' Anita (Yeah)
She got the weave and I'm callin' her Tina
Yeah, okay, yeah, uh, yeah

Heard they wanna be like us
Heard they wanna see like us
OKC like Russ

Better go and take that bus
Can't be me, that's tough (Uh, yeah)
Okay, I had to double the beat, okay (Yeah)
I had to get to the lean, okay
I had to go with the beat, okay (Yeah)
I got the sword, they call me Finn
Hole in her tummy, I'm callin' her Rin
Your album is sakura, I'm callin' it mid

But I picked already, so don't trip (Let's go)
Had to keep the blicky on the hip (Uh)
Heard he in the party gettin' kicked (Okay)

[Verse 2: TyFontaine]
Party pack in my hands now
Geeked up and I ran out
Your bitch turned to a fan now
I step in and she fan out (Steppin')
Fuck the talkin', pull bands out
Now she walkin' with her ass out
She want my last, I'm 'bout to lash out
She ain't touchin' my stash house (Woo, woo)
Decapitated 'cause the head was immaculate
Numb in the toe, like what the fuck happenin'?
Nigga don't know, I'm out here stackin' it
Niggas don't know what they take and they vanishing
I talk my shit 'cause they don't think I'm backin' it
I talk my shit 'cause it really disgusts them (I talk my shit)
I talk my shit 'cause the thread is custom
And I talk my shit to the bitch when I'm bussin' her (Let's go)
Yo, huh, yeah, I'm with the gang right now (Yeah)
Niggas too lame right now (Ayy)
Fuck the cap and gown
I ain't need that to get the amount
In my accounts, without a doubt
Facin' the za, facin' a pound
And I break it down with the gang right now, go

[Chorus: Cochise]
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm with the gang right now (Right now)
No, I can't hang right now (Right now)
No way, lil' shawty look lame right now (Right now)
Need a AP plain right now (Right now)
Need a VV chain right now (Right now)
Need a blue ice ring right now (Right now)
That's my new lil' thing right now (Right now), yeah, yeah
Got a noodle shrimp with the stick (Stick)
When I'm runnin', I can never slip (Slip)
When they see me, wanna take a flick (Flick)
So much shawties, I can't even pick
But I picked already, so don't trip
I had to keep the blicky on the hip
Heard he in the party gettin' kicked (Right now, right now, right now)
