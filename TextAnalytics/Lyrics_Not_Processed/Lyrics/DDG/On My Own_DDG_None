[Intro]
Yeah
Ktwice on the beat

[Verse 1]
Landed fresh on the city I'm stuck in baggage
Tunnel vision for money, I'm doing damage
Using all of my struggles to my advantage
But this hate that I'm getting is slowly making me savage
Getting sick and I'm traveling coast to coast
I got money I'm valid enough to boast
Breadwinner my pockets is stuffed with toast
I don't know you little nigga don't tag me in what you post

[Chorus]
These girls don't want me for me
They just finesse on the clout
These niggas don't support me
I make a move and they doubt
These niggas copying me
I call these niggas my clones
These niggas hatin' on me
Gotta do this on my own

[Verse 2]
They ask me why I don't talk
I just sit back and observe
And I done blew up so quick
I just kept straight while you curve
It's back to back like ping pong
I know my ex vibe to my song
I been in love for too long
Why they keep doing me wrong
These days love do not exist
Niggas not faithful and girls don't commit
So we go clubbing and be drinking and shit
Boasting on snap and it's not even lit
I'd rather have just one girl to myself
All of this drinking not good for my health
I got a sold out show on the 12th
I just be working and building my wealth (aye)

[Chorus]
These girls don't want me for me
They just finesse on the clout
These niggas don't support me
I make a move and they doubt
These niggas copying me
I call these niggas my clones
These niggas hatin' on me
Gotta do this on my own

[Outro]
Gotta do this on my own
Got to do this on my own yeah
