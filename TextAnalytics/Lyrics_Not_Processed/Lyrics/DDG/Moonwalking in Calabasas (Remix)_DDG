[Verse 1: DDG]
Ballin' since I was a jit
Way before Oakland and filmin' the skits
I had a goal to get rich
Mama was strugglin' payin' the rent
I couldn't help her with shit
Hate that I'm feelin' so stuck in this bitch (Devo this shit hard)
Car broke down, can't fix that shit
I cried at night, I'll admit that shit
'02 old, I'll whip that bitch
She left me 'lone but I miss that bitch
If she text right now, I'll hit that bitch
Old friends like, "How you get that lit?"
Same old me but they think I switched
Fuck old friends, I don't know that bitch
Racks too big, can't fold that shit
I ain't get none when I owed that shit
Mama, I told you we gon' be okay
Whippin' the Benz and she live in L.A.Â 
Tryna thank God, but don't know what to say

[Verse 2: Blueface]
Don't call that lil' ass place no estate
Unless it came with a pool and a gate
Check the rear before I pull in the gate
All my watches flooded just like a lake
Lately I've been showing up extra late
Rich nigga take her on a cheap date
4 for 4 Wendy's get her a plate
Love when these nuts all up in her face
She say "Wow, never met a nigga with dick and a house"
Spit in her mouth, diggin' her out
With a choppa in the couch for a rat or a mouse, uh

[Chorus: DDG]
Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louis bag, gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mm, got some millions, but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamins, we don't fuck with Jacksons

[Verse 3: DDG]
Bet when I drop, they don't post that shit (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
All good though, I'ma note that shit
When I blow, you'll owe me, bitch
Humble-ass nigga but I know I'm rich (Yeah, rich as fuck)
Fuck that shit, I know I'm lit
If we beef, I'll fuck your bitch
All of the niggas I beef on the internet
I hit up all of they bitches and get 'em wet
Call her a Uber, I hit 'em and send 'em back
Do it in silence cause players ain't into that
No, oh, I hit his bitch on the low, oh
She said your dick game was so-so
And she had told me you broke, oh , that's tough

[Verse 4: Blueface]
That's tough, that's tough
Blueface and DDG, hoes at the BnB
Watching a DVD, giving her DVD
2020 Wagon, A-B-C-D-F-G
Get too close, it go beep-beep-beep-beep-beep
Road Runner, all he heard was meep-meep-meep
Nyoom, seven-fifty in the horse
Hopped off the porch and I crashed the Porsche
Hop out the bed and I smash the whore
Knock-knock, guess who's at the door
Oops, forgot I ordered that Dior (Bop)
Came in straight from Europe (Bop)

[Pre-Chorus: DDG]
Spent four hunnid on beanies easy
She want dick, she needy, freaky, I like Wraiths, no Lamborghini
She off X, she sleepy-sleepy, yeah
Make me a wish, no genie-genie, vanish on niggas just like Houdini

[Chorus: DDG]
Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louis bag, gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mm, got some millions but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamins, we don't fuck with Jacksons

[Outro: DDG & Blueface]
Benjamins, we don't fuck with Jacksons (Bop)
I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
