[Intro]
(Chip!)
Ayy
Ok (Yeah, whoa whoa whoa)
Listen

[Verse 1]
Bigger appraisal on my AP
All these broke niggas hate me
Money long, so lengthy
VVS on my pinky
Gucci fanny fuck a pocket
Plugged in like a socket
Career shooting like a rocket
They refresh till I drop it (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Niggas be talkin', but ain't 'bout that action
Bet when they see me, ain't nothin' gon' happen
Six bitches hop in the Bimmer, no cappin'
Four seater coupé, so I had 'em all lappin'
Used to be broke used to sleep on the floor
I just dropped 40 racks at the store
Google my net worth, then times it by 4
That's disrespectful, they know I got more

[Chorus]
Niggas be talkin', but ain't 'bout that action
Bet when they see me, ain't nothin' gon' happen
Six bitches hop in the Bimmer, no cappin'
Four seater coupé, so I had 'em all lappin'
Used to be broke, used to sleep on the floor
I just dropped 40 racks at the store
Google my net worth, then times it by 4
That's disrespectful, they know I got more

[Verse 2]
New wave, new money
Young niggas gettin' paid
I just turned 20 (Hah!)
Already got millions, ayy
Smokin' gelato, big checks and the paper
I'm used to Henny, I don't need no chaser
Your diamonds fufu and cloudy like vaper
That girl a eater, she fucked off my taper
Hatin' ass niggas is furious now
I bet they taking me serious now
"Who is this nigga?" They curious now
All of my millions mysterious now
They don't wanna see me win (Nope)
They don't wanna see me blow (Nah)
They don't wanna hear the flow (Nah)
But I don't give a fuck no mo', ayy (Fuck 'em!)
Old relationships, lessons learned, so I right all my wrongs (Right 'em, yeah!)
But fuck that, I'm dissing all of my exes in all of my songs (Bitch!)
Bridges burn after fucking with me
You fall off after fucking with me
You get left after fucking with me
You better off never fucking with me

[Chorus]
Niggas be talkin', but ain't 'bout that action
Bet when they see me, ain't nothin' gon' happen
Six bitches hop in the Bimmer, no cappin'
Four seater coupé, so I had 'em all lappin'
Used to be broke, used to sleep on the floor
I just dropped 40 racks at the store
Google my net worth, then times it by 4
That's disrespectful, they know I got more

[Chorus]
Niggas be talkin', but ain't 'bout that action
Bet when they see me, ain't nothin' gon' happen
Six bitches hop in the Bimmer, no cappin'
Four seater coupé, so I had 'em all lappin'
Used to be broke, used to sleep on the floor
I just dropped 40 racks at the store
Google my net worth, then times it by 4
That's disrespectful, they know I got more
