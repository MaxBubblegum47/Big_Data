[Intro]
TreOnTheBeat, yeah
Aye, okay
Uh, yeah! Okay
Okay, ooh
Ooh, uh, yeah! Okay, okay

[Chorus]
Big bag, big racks (Aye), on that same shit (Yeah)
Broke boy spent his last dollar on that lame bitch (Okay)
Hunnid in a Beamer, quit swervin' in my lane, bitch
Givenchy on my collar, sippin' Henny, I can't stain it (Bitch)
Big bag, big racks (Aye), on that same shit (Yeah)
Broke boy spent his last dollar on that lame bitch (Okay)
Hunnid in a Beamer, quit swervin' in my lane, bitch
Givenchy on my collar, sippin' Henny, I can't stain it (Bitch)

[Verse]
(You can't fuck with that bitch 'cause you broke!) She a boss (Yeah)
You a broke boy and she can't take a loss
So she leavin' with me (Who?), DDG!
While you payin' for pussy (I'm fucking for free)
Ba-Ba-Band on my shirt (Yeah), she a flirt (Okay)
Val-Valet the Beamer, pull up and we skrrt
I got racks in the bank (Ooh), what you think?
All this ice on my neck, it's too wet, I'ma sink (Aye, yeah)
I got money, I got chicken, come here, lil' bitch, listen
Social media got me rich, I ain't have to use a kitchen
Niggas dissin' DDG, they be itchin' for attention
I got racks in my bank (Ooh, pockets Peter Griffin)
Drop 40 on my wrist, drop 20 on my bitch
60 bands, that's not shit, DDG gettin' rich
But this Henny got me hot (I'm lit!), I'm drunk a lot
Eyes low off the pot, pockets lookin' like snot
(I got my banker on my phone) Check them out
Stock market got boosted and it tripled your amount
DDG gettin' money, they hatin', it's funny
You broke, you a dummy (My wrist make it sunny)
You ain't tough, you tweeter, your bitch, she a eater
She fucking off my sneakers, my jewelry is a freezer
R-Rollie-Rollie-Rollie wet like tsunami, cuban drenched in Dasani
I be rockin' Givenchy while I'm fucking yo' mommy

[Chorus]
Big bag, big racks (Aye), on that same shit (Yeah)
Broke boy spent his last dollar on that lame bitch (Okay)
Hunnid in a Beamer, quit swervin' in my lane, bitch
Givenchy on my collar, sippin' Henny, I can't stain it (Bitch)
Big bag, big racks (Aye), on that same shit (Yeah)
Broke boy spent his last dollar on that lame bitch (Okay)
Hunnid in a Beammer, quit swervin' in my lane, bitch
Givenchy on my collar, sippin' Henny, I can't stain it (Bitch)
