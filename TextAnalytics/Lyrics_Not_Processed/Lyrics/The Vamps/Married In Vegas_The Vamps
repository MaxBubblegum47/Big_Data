[Verse 1]
No good for me or my frame of mind
I think about you all the time
A pretty little thing could wreck me at 25
Just say the words, and I'm all ears
Let's turn a drink into five years
Spend my money, oh, honey, come and bleed me dry

[Pre-Chorus]
I came here to be someone else
I found you and I found myself
Mister, mister, I'm all in
Bet your house and I'll call it

[Chorus]
Feels like a TKO
Feels like the lowest blow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Under the neon lights
I think we might get married in Vegas

[Post-Chorus]
Married in Vegas

[Verse 2]
Pushin' 106 down PCH
I drink you down, the aftertaste
Tastes like heartbreak and mistakes, but I can't wait
To walk along that starry strip
I feel it all, it feels like bliss
I show my hand, they look like this

[Pre-Chorus]
Mister, mister, I'm all in
Bet your house and I'll call it

[Chorus]
Feels like a TKO
Feels like the lowest blow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Under the neon lights
I think we might get married in Vegas

[Post-Chorus]
Married in Vegas

[Bridge]
For better or for worse
I'll be riding high
Even if it's just tonight or the rest of my life
So come on, do your worst
I'll stay here all night
Cash out, cards down, I'll roll the dice

[Interlude]
All these things that I've done
Sin City under the sun
I came to win and I won
I'll leave with you sittin' shotgun
All these things that I've done
Sin City under the sun
I came to win and I won

[Chorus]
Feels like a TKO
Feels like the lowest blow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Under the neon lights
I think we might get married in Vegas
