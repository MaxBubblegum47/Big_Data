[Verse 1]
I'm so sick of staying up losing sleep, who gives a fuck?
Don't you? Don't you?
Lie in bed sometimes at night and miss looking into my eyes
Don't you? 'Cause I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be this cold
Shivering to my bones
Someone reset my soul, oh, oh
And I don't wanna be locked out
I don't wanna feel this doubt
I just wanna scream and shout

[Chorus]
I’ll go out, grow my hair too long
Sing your least favourite song
At the top of my lungs (oh, oh, oh)
I'll go out, kiss all of your friends
Make a story and pretend
It was me who made this end
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Let me take a second to sympathise 'cause you're right
I'm away too much, I think too much, I drink too much
But it's only a matter of time before we catch up
And I get to say
I wouldn't have it any other way
'Cause it's made me think and drink my way
Back to mistakes I never should have made
One more chance and I'll right the wrongs from yesterday

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna be locked out
I don't wanna feel this doubt
I just wanna scream and shout

[Chorus]
I’ll go out, grow my hair too long
Sing your least favourite song
At the top of my lungs (oh, oh, oh)
I'll go out, kiss all of your friends
Make a story and pretend
It was me who made this end (oh, oh, oh)
It might seem cruel
You know that the love still hurts
All I do, never, ever seems to work
I’ll go out, grow my hair too long
Sing your least favourite song
At the top of my lungs
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
I been stumbling round
Asking if you're in town
I been drinking too much
I don't give a ...

[Chorus]
I’ll go out, grow my hair too long
Sing your least favourite song
At the top of my lungs

[Chorus]
I'll go out, kiss all of your friends
Make a story and pretend
It was me who made this end (oh, oh, oh)
It might seem cruel
You know that the love still hurts
All I do, never, ever seems to work
I’ll go out, grow my hair too long
Sing your least favourite song
At the top of my lungs
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
I been stumbling round (round, round)
Asking if you're in town (town, town)
I been drinking too much (oh, I know I am)
I don't give a (fuck)
I been stumbling round (round, round)
Asking if you're in town (town, town)
I been drinking too much
I don't give a
(Hey!)
