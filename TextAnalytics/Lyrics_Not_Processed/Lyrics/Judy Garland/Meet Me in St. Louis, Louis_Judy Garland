When Louis came home to the flat
He hung up his coat and his hat
He gazed all around
But no wifey he found
So he said "Where can Flossy be at"
A note on the table he spied
He read it just once then he cried
It read 'Louis dear it's toos low for me here
So I think I will go for a ride Oh
Meet me in St. Louis, Louis
Meet me at the fair
Don't tell me the lights are shining
Any place but there
We will dance the hoochie coochie
I will be your tootsie wootsie
If you will meet me in st. Louis, Louis
Meet me at the fair
(Company)
Meet me in st. Louis, Louis
Meet me at the fair
Don't tell me the lights are shining
Any place but there
We will dance the hoochie coochie
I will be your tootsie wootsie
If you will meet me in St. Louis, Louis
Meet me at the fair
