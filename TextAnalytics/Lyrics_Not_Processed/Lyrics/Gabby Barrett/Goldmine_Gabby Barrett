[Verse 1]
I was a girl in the world all alone
Never gave up lookin' for ya
Turned every rock and I've rolled every stone
From Tennessee to California

[Pre-Chorus]
Took a chance on the floor
In mile-high high-heel shoes
Then you walked through the door
And I stumbled into you

[Chorus]
Boy, you're a goldmine, goldmine
And I'm diggin' on ya, goldmine
An endless supply of your love, oh my god
If your kisses are riches, then you've hit the jackpot

[Verse 2]
You got the Saturday night Midas touch
Stand next to you and I'm shinin'
Everyone here knows that I'm so in love
You got this girl sweatin' diamonds

[Pre-Chorus]
In your arms, in the dark
In the silver of the moon
Tell me, what did I do
To land a man like you?

[Chorus]
Boy, you're a goldmine, goldmine
And I'm diggin' on ya, goldmine
An endless supply of your love, oh my god
If your kisses are riches, then you've hit the jackpot

[Post-Chorus]
Hit the jackpot, hit the jackpot
You're a goldmine, baby

[Bridge]
Gold, gold, goldmine
Gold, gold, goldmine (Yeah, I've been diggin' on ya)
Gold, gold, goldmine
Gold, gold, yeah

[Chorus]
Boy, you're a goldmine, goldmine
And I'm diggin' on ya, goldmine
An endless supply of your love, oh my god
If your kisses are riches, then you've hit the jackpot

[Post-Chorus]
Goldmine, yeah, yeah, ow
