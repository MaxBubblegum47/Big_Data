[Intro]
I was thinkin' somethin’ like
You're the only reason I'm here

[Verse 1]
You’re my solid rock, my gospel choir
My faith, my walk-me-through-the-fire

[Pre-Chorus]
And all along, you've been the one
The one that I lean on
I made it through because of you
If I'm anything at all

[Chorus]
You're the only reason I'm here
Even if it was my highway
Thank God I let you steer, I
Know without your lovin'
Oh, I would be nothin'
You kept me believin'
I know you’re the only reason I’m here

[Verse 2]
You stayed in the shadows of the spotlight
Gonna take the time, gonna let it shine on you tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And all along, you've been the one
The one that I lean on
I made it through because of you
If I’m anything at all

[Chorus]
You're the only reason I'm here
Even if it was my highway
Thank God I let you steer, I
Know without your lovin'
Oh, I would be nothin’
You kept me believin'
I know you're the only reason I'm here

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah
Oh woah, oh, oh

[Bridge]
You're the only reason I'm here (I'm here)
Even if it was my highway
Thank God I let you steer, I (Let you steer)
Know without your lovin' (Woah)
Oh, I would be nothin' (Would be nothin')
You kept me believin'
I know you're the only reason I'm here

[Chorus]
You're the only reason I'm here (Oh)
Even if it was my highway
Thank God I let you steer, I (Let you steer)
Know without your lovin' (Oh)
Oh, I would be nothin' (I would be nothin')
You kept me believin'
I know you're the only reason I'm here, yeah, woah

[Outro]
Mmm, yeah
(Ooh) Ah
