[Verse 1]
Not havin' that much money
Led to dreamin' that much more
And that got me to Nashville
Tryna knock down slammin' doors

[Pre-Chorus]
One call led to a red eye, goodbye
What have I got to lose?
Then one thing led to another, led to another
It all led to you

[Chorus]
Thank God for the hang-ups and the breakups
And the wake-up, make-up tears on my pillowcase
The all wrongs and the almosts
And the all time lows all took me to the way
My head fits on your shoulder
My heart can't help but stop
Mmm, look at us, how could I not look at you
And thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God?
(Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God)

[Verse 2]
I remember feelin'
Love slippin' through my hands
He knew what He was doin'
I just didn't understand

[Pre-Chorus]
One prayer led to an outta-nowhere boy
Too good to believe
One thing led to another, led to another
All led you to me

[Chorus]
Thank God for the hang-ups and the breakups
And the wake-up, make-up tears on my pillowcase
The all wrongs and the almosts
And the all time lows all took me to the way
My head fits on your shoulder
My heart can't help but stop
Mmm, look at us, how could I not look at you
And thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God?
(Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God)

[Bridge]
All the hurt that I've gone through
I'd be crazy not to

[Chorus]
Thank God for the hang-ups and the breakups
And the wake-up, make-up tears on my pillowcase
The all wrongs and the almosts
And the all time lows all took me to the way
My head fits on your shoulder
My heart can't help but stop
Mmm, look at us, how could I not look at you
And thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God?
(Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God)

[Outro]
Mmm, look at us, how could I not look at you
And thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God?
