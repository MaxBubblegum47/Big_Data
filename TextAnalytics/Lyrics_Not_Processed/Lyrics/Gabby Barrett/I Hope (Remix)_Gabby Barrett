[Intro: Charlie Puth]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Gabby Barrett]
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

[Chorus: Gabby Barrett]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
Yeah, babe, I hope he shows up in a 2 AM pic from a friend
Hanging on to a girl to just rub it in
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then he calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
Let him take you on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know he's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope he comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope he spends his last dime to put a rock on your hand
I hope he's wilder than your wildest dreams
He's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me

[Bridge: Gabby Barrett]
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now

[Chorus: Gabby Barrett & Charlie Puth]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy (Oh woah, oh)
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans (Oh)
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

[Outro: Gabby Barrett & Charlie Puth]
Like you did on me
