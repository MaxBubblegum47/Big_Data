Before your eyes, I fall below
Hitting rock bottom, I'm sinking too deep
I tried to grab, what's left to hope
Both hands are begging for something to reach

In this dark place again, I'mma light up the sky
I look in your eyes and I'll kiss you goodbye
Laugh all you want cause it's almost your time
Ready for it  3 2 1

Ha how you like that? Brrrah
You gon’ like that that that that that
That that that that
How you like that? (Barabim barabum bumbum)
How you like that that that that that
That that that that

Now look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
How you like that
Now look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
How you like that

Your girl need it all and that's a hundred
10 out of 10 if i want it i got it
Karma come on get some
I might feel bad, what you gon' do 'bout that?
What's up? I'm right back
Pull the trigger cocked back
Plain Jane get highjacked
Don't like me then tell me how you like that, like that

Though I'm in the dark I still shine like the stars
I flash you a smile and I'll kiss you goodbye
Laugh all you want cause it's almost your time
Ready for it  3 2 1

Ha how you like that?
You gon’ like that that that that that
That that that that
How you like that? (Barabim barabum bumbum)
How you like that that that that that
That that that that

Now look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
How you like that
Now look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
Look at you now look at me
How you like that

The day I fell without my wings up from the sky
The days trapped in the dark just searching for the light
You should have known, I got you running for your life
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane

Yeah Bring out your boss bitch
Yeah BLACKPINK!
