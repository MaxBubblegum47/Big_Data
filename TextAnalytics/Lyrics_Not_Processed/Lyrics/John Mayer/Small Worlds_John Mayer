[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
The world is so small 'til it ain't, yeah
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break
She hate it when I call and it's late
I don't wanna keep you waitin'
I hope I never keep you waitin', yeah

[Verse 1]
I think I know it all but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you're broke? Yeah
And I just wanna ball
Maybe dunk but I never been tall, yeah
I might trip, I never fall
God knows I came close (Don't try this at home)
I know I probably need to do better
Fuck whoever, keep my shit together
You never told me bein' rich was so lonely
Nobody know me; oh, well
Hard to complain from this five-star hotel
I'm always in a rush, I've been thinkin' too much, but
Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us

[Refrain]
That's really all it takes
We don't need nothin' but today (Day), today (Day)
Today (Day), today (Day)

[Chorus]
The world is so small 'til it ain't
('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break
('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call and it's late
(And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waitin' (I don't wanna keep you waitin')
I hope I never keep you waitin' (I hope I never keep you waitin')

[Bridge]
Woo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, got a bad attitude, playin' 'til I'm out of moves
No need for shame, I get mo' peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak
It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezin', snow season (Made me)
They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And the stroke is just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawin' shapes and lines of a world we made
Tomorrow may be right around the corner
But I swear it's gon' be worth it if I make you wait
There's somewhere above you, keep reachin' up

[Refrain]
That's really all it takes (That's really all it takes)
We don't need nothin' but today (Day), today (Day)
Today (Day), today (Day)

[Chorus]
The world is so small 'til it ain't
('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break
('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call and it's late
(And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waitin' (I don't wanna keep you waitin')
I hope I never keep you waitin'

[Verse 3]
Yeah, nine times out of ten I get it wrong
That's why I wrote this song, tell myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin'
In a motherfuckin' instant, I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?
Starin' at the wall and the wall full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be?
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Ooh, I been a fool but it's cool, that's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun comin' out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothin' but the truth
I'm tired, I don't got a spare second
Win or lose, win or lose
I don't keep count, nobody checkin'
