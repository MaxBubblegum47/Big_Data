[Verse 1]
I could tell you all about it
If I just knew where to start
Thought that I would never doubt it
'Til the day I fell apart
Not a complicated story
A beginning and an end
Dunno what you did before me
I don't care 'bout where you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry, I know I'm impossible
I don't know why I've been
Needing to take it slow
I don't know what to say

[Chorus]
I know why he's still dancing in my brain
I, I, I'm with you and it's not the same
I know why I've been leaving things unsaid
I, I, I'm sleeping in the wrong bed

[Verse 2]
You could tell me all about her
'Bout the way she said your name
How you couldn't live without her
How you'll never be the same
We could play that game forever
Scratching at each other's scars
Tell me how would that be better?
Wouldn't get us very far

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you're tired just let it go
Move closer
Don't need to talk, we can take it slow
There's nothing more to say

[Chorus]
I know why he's still dancing in my brain
I, I, I'm with you and it's not the same
I know why I've been leaving things unsaid
I, I, I'm sleeping in the wrong bed
I know why he's still dancing in my brain
I, I, I'm with you and it's not the same
I know why I've been leaving things unsaid
I, I, I'm sleeping in the wrong bed

[Outro]
I know why, I know why
I know why, I know why
Sleeping in the wrong bed
