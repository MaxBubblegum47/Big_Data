[Verse 1]
Well babe I've got this drink
Turns out I've got some space
I love to drink alone
I hate this empty place
I'd like to spend some time
You look like Friday night
I'd like to dress you up and
Take you on a carpet ride

I've seen a couple things
I know the way it goes
Like everybody says
Cause everybody knows
Maybe you're the one for me
We could be so cliche
I hate to see you leave but
Love to watch you walk away

[Chorus]
I've been so tired on the weekend
I've been holding on too tight
I never thought I'd be thinking
"I want-"
I spent the whole summer sleeping
You've been staying up all night
I never thought I'd be thinking
"I want you"

[Verse 2]
Don't make me play this game
Don't have the time to waste
Don't need to read my mind
Cause I'll just tell you straight
Why don't you show me 'round?
And I can show you off
And if we're not too careful
Baby we can both get lost

[Chorus]
I've been so tired on the weekend
I've been holding on too tight
I never thought I'd be thinking
"I want-"
I spent the whole summer sleeping
You've been staying up all night
I never thought I'd be thinking
"I want you"

[Bridge]
I want you
I want you
So let me take you for a while
Cause I...

[Chorus]
I've been so tired on the weekend
I've been holding on too tight
I never thought I'd be thinking
"I want-"
I spent the whole summer sleeping
You've been staying up all night
I never thought I'd be thinking
"I want you"

I've been so tired on the weekend
I've been holding on too tight
I never thought I'd be thinking
"I want-"
I spent the whole summer sleeping
You've been staying up all night
I never thought I'd be thinking
"I want you"

[Outro]
I want you
I want you
So let me take you for a while
Cause I want you
