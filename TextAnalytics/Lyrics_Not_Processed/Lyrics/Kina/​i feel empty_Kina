[Intro]
Shadows settled on the place, that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Shadows settled on the place, that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness

[Chorus]
Shadows settled on the place, that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Shadows settled on the place, that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness

[Bridge]
Shadows settled on the place, that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Shadows settled on the place, that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness

[Chorus]
Shadows settled on the place, that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Shadows settled on the place, that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness

[Outro]
Shadows settled on the place, that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
