[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, the stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still I find you there
Next to me

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, the stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still I find you there
Next to me

[Chorus]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, the stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still I find you there
Next to me

[Outro]
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
