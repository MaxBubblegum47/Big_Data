[Intro]
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

[Verse 1]
Oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop

[Chorus]
But my heart goes, goes, goes, goes

[Verse 2]
Oooh, oh my god, oh my god, can't believe what I've become
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think, singing songs I've never sung
Oh my god, oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough ('Cause my heart)
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop

[Chorus]
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum (Mmm)
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes

[Verse 1]
Oh my god, oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop

[Chorus]
'Cause my heart goes
And it goes, and it goes...

[Verse 2]
Oooh, oh my god, oh my god, can't believe what I've become
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think, singing songs I've never sung
Oh my god, oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)

[Outro]
And my heart goes
