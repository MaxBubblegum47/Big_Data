[Intro]
Oh my God, oh my God, this feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my God, oh my God, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop (Tells me to stop)

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop, but my heart goes

[Chorus]
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum, 'cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum, ooh

[Verse]
Oh my God, oh my God, can't believe what I've become
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think, singing songs I've never sung, ohh
Oh my God, oh my God, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop (Tells me to stop)

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough ('Cause my heart)
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop, but my heart goes

[Chorus]
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum, 'cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum (Mm)
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum, but my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum

[Outro]
Oh my God, oh my God, can't believe what I've become
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think, singing songs I've never sung, ohh
Oh my God, oh my God, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
But my heart goes—
