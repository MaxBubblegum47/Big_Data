[Intro: GOODBOYS]
What? Sorry, just quickly

[Verse 1: Harlee]
You are the one who said it's over
Now you wanna come back
So take your hand off my shoulder
This time it's not like that 'cause I know where your heart's at

[Pre-Chorus: Harlee]
I know you like to be alone, but hate being lonely
When you see me doing well, that's when you call me
Yeah, I'm doing fine, don't need you in my life
I guess you're missing me now

[Chorus: Harlee]
Just because you're lonely, doesn't mean we go back to the start
Just because you're lonely, don't mean that you can play with my heart
Who do you think you are?

[Drop: Harlee & GOODBOYS, Harlee]
L-l-l-l-lonely, l-l-l-l-lonely
L-l-l-l-lonely, L-l-l-l
Who do you think you are?

[Verse 2: Harlee]
You say you've changed and you're different
But I don't wanna hear that
Your friends are saying that you miss me
But I already know that 'cause I know where your heart's at

[Pre-Chorus: Harlee]
I know you like to be alone, but hate being lonely
When you see me doing well, that's when you call me
Yeah, I'm doing fine, don't need you in my life
I guess you're missing me now

[Chorus: Harlee]
Just because you're lonely, doesn't mean we go back to the start
Just because you're lonely, don't mean that you can play with my heart
Who do you think you are?

[Bridge: Harlee]
Just because you're lonely
Just because you're lonely
Just because you're lonely
Just because you're lonely
Just because you're lonely
Just because you're lonely
Just because you're lonely
Who do you think you are?

[Drop: Harlee & GOODBOYS, Harlee]
L-l-l-l-lonely, l-l-l-l-lonely
L-l-l-l-lonely, L-l-l-l
Who do you think you are?
L-l-l-l-lonely, l-l-l-l-lonely
L-l-l-l-lonely, L-l-l-l
Who do you think you are?
