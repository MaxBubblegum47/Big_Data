[Intro: Chief Keef]
Young Chop on the beat
I can't spell sober
I'm a smoker, Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water
Sober, my bitches stay sober
Sober
Damn, I hate bein' sober
I hate bein' sober

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
Damn I hate bein' sober, I’m a smoker
Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water
We can’t spell sober
Ballout roll up, when we roll up bitches be on us
All the hoes they love smoking and love drinking
Anti-sober, for no reason
'Cause we can’t spell sober
Ya know us, we smoke strong bruh
Watch me roll up
'Cause I can’t spell sober

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
On my tour bus we get dumb high, you’s a floor boy
Fredo got a hangover he toting a Cobra
Last night he was shooting shit up like O-Dog
Reesy rollin', Tadoe got hoes on mollies
Chief Sosa, Ballout, we high ridin' ‘Raris
My bitches love drinking, some love smoking
Let my alcoholic bitch hit the dutch, she start choking
Call up D-Money, now we throw money
All these bitches off the shits walk around like some zombies
Call up D-Money, now we throw money
All these bitches off the shits walk around like some zombies

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
Damn I hate bein' sober, I’m a smoker
Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water
We can’t spell sober
Ballout roll up, when we roll up bitches be on us
All the hoes they love smoking and love drinking
Anti-sober, for no reason
'Cause we can’t spell sober
Ya know us, we smoke strong bruh
Watch me roll up
'Cause I can’t spell sober

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
We got 100 pounds of this shit (Yeah)

Too young for me she want Sosa (Sosa)
Shooters in the Range Rover
That's GBE, when them two-two-threes get to flyin' bitch it's over
See my ring chain and my Rolex when I’m flexin' (When I'm flexin')

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
Damn I hate bein' sober, I’m a smoker
Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
My weed so strong, my cheese so long (Cheese so long)
Roll so many joints soon I might need a lung (Might need a lung)
Spend so many grands that I might need some bands (Might need some bands)

Well, bitch, I smoke by the pound ‘cause

[Chorus: Chief Keef & Wiz Khalifa]
Damn I hate bein' sober (Hahaha), I’m a smoker
