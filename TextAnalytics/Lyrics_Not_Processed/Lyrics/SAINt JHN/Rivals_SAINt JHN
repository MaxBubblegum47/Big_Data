[Intro: Future + 
Usher
]
She got me throwing Spades Ace with that mouth
I guess only time gon' tell
You gotta give me dirty love
I guess I'm down too
When I can't find any words I lie
Look up and see the stars in a perfect line
The feeling of love is a global thing

[Verse 1: Usher + 
Future
]
So tell me how you feel (
how you feel
)
Knowing I see the world when I look in your eyes
Your kisses are Duracell, they keep me energized
Tired of going back and forth, baby I'm hypnotized
You gotta a nigga on the love on the low though
I'm looking at you and I swear it's been a long road
A great ass, a better mind, what a combo
You know you pretty and you winning with the convo
She kinda tipsy, we been drinking, she's a light weight
She love the way I'm pull them panties in the right way
But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling
I just love the times when I'm beside ya
Holding me down cause you're my rider
I look in your eyes and I get higher
There's nothing in this world I hold tighter
Without you I feel uneven

[Chorus: Usher + 
Future
]
Make every day our love season
Baby girl you know you're my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
(
You gotta give me that
)
I put that on the Bible
(
You gotta give me that girl
)
You're the only thing that I want
Give me that feeling
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
I call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible
I'ma love ya till my time's gone
You gotta give me dirty love

[Verse 2: Usher]
I've been here and trust me, I've seen it all before though
I told my ex for me relationships a no-no
And here I am thinking we perfect like a photo
You looking at me like right now you need some mo', mo'
I know you ready and willing but that ain't my place
I know you wanna settle down, all on your face
Feeling starting to get too familiar
So cover up this broken love treason

[Chorus: Usher + 
Future
]
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
I call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible
You're the only thing that I want
Give me that feeling
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you bae that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible
I'ma love ya till my time's gone

[Bridge: Usher]
You say I see ya side by side
Like a visionary, I can't see me falling
(Nothing's changed)
Like a dictionary, I can't read through all this
(Eyes wide open)
I still fall blind I don't know how this will end
Let's go back to the beginning
Let's cover up this broken love treason

[Chorus: Usher]
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible
You're the only thing that I want

[Outro]
Gimme that
Ay, ay
Yes you are
I love you, baby
I don't wanna be enemies, baby
I want you to be friends with me, babe
Uhhh
