[Intro: SAINt JHN]
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, heya
(F a l l e n)

[Chorus: SAINt JHN]
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, that's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was...

[Verse 1: SAINt JHN]
Trap, she do licks, she the one I forget
She do coke, she do blow
She do dope, make a list
This the life, don't forget
Sober nights, make it lit
She the one, you the one, I'm the one, what a trick
I ain't never tellin' lies, cross my heart and hope to die
If this real, it's real forever, maybe never testify
Put the pedal to the floor, look the devil in the eye
If you tell me that you love me, promise not to change your mind

[Pre-Chorus: SAINt JHN]
We're light sleepin' in the middle tonight
With the bass turned loud
Will you turn on the light?
Wish you furs for the winter, wish you champagne on ice
Middle fingers to the police

[Chorus: SAINt JHN]
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever really knew was trap, that's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was...

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Trap, only thing we ever had to do was trap
I was breaking down bales and now switched it to rap
Shawty was the man, like, "Damn nigga, what happened?"
I'ma keep chasin’ the money, as far as I ever see
Had to kick my double-cup, feel like it was killin' me
I was sittin' in the spot, I ain't never missed a beat
If I'm feelin' in my heart, I'ma put it on a beat, like
Runnin' down on 'em, don't trip
Make sure your whole clip fit
Know it was hard livin', tryna survive this bullshit
I'm a part of my niggas, we all gon' get rich
Still remember sellin' 2-for-5
Now I have a million dollar ride
Still be havin' thoughts about the guy

[Pre-Chorus: SAINt JHN]
(Only love a real nigga ever knew was—)
We're light sleepin' in the middle tonight
With the bass turned loud
Will you turn on the light?
Wish you furs for the winter, wish you champagne on ice
Middle finger to the police

[Chorus: SAINt JHN]
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, I trap, I trap
Really came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was trap, that's fact, that's fact
Nigga came up from the mat, no turnin' back
Only love a real nigga ever knew was—
