[Intro]
Girl we can't ever get divorced if I marry you
You tryna find all the emotions, I bury it
You tryna see who I am tonight, but I vary
Shit that I learned, you can't learn in no library

[Chorus]
You can be a suspect, you can be a custy
Still know how the trap work, even if I'm rusty
These are still the hood rules, this the way it must be
If you're not a made man, you can not discuss me
This is not for play now, things that I pray about
Paid my mama house off, win a VMA now
Tryna buy a grotto, strappin' on the Greyhound
Aimin' at the opps now, circlin' the playground
Virginia for real though, niggas sellin' real low
Touch a quarter mill', oh, weigh it by the kilo
I'm just sayin' facts now, you should see the B-roll
End up in the lowlife, tryna be a hero
You can be a suspect, you can be a custy
Still know how the trap work, even if I'm rusty
These are just the real facts, this the way it must be
You could never graze, never brush, never touch me

[Verse 1]
Just me and my wifey for life
Just me and me and my side-piece if you like
Just me and my dime-piece in the light
I don't mean to objectify her in a lie
But if she prefers to be a bad bitch tonight
Who am I to not honor her sacrifice?
I don't want to just patronize
She likes it when I look in her eyes

[Chorus]
You can be a suspect, you can be a custy
Still know how the trap work, even if I'm rusty
These are still the hood rules, this the way it must be
If you're not a made man, you can not discuss me
This is not for play now, things that I play about
Paid my mama house off, win a VMA now
Tryna buy a grotto, strappin' on the Greyhound
Aimin' at the opps now, circlin' the playground
Virginia for real though, niggas sellin' real low
Touch a quarter mill', oh, weigh it by the kilo
I'm just sayin' facts now, you should see the B-roll
End up in the lowlife, tryna be a hero

[Verse 2]
Rick James, bitch, in the mink coat
Act surprised, even though you know I been cold
Say you miss me, even though you say it in code
Still in love, although we're no longer involved
Silked down, bitch, not in Rick O
We made it to a Slim Jxmmi from a Jim Crow
Only thing I never learned, how to be simple
So close lips, close eyes, never info
'Cause these nights are the rarest
These nights excite, when these lights are the spirits
This life the life where you rewrite what your fear is
When you reach these heights this life is the clearest, uh
These nights are the rarest
These nights excite, when these lights are the spirits
When you reach these heights you rewrite what your fear is
Yes, I'm seein' my shit the clearest
