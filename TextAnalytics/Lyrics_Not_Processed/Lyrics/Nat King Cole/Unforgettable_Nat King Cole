[Chorus 1]
Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far

[Verse 1]
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before
Has someone been more...

[Chorus 2]
Unforgettable
In every way
And forever more
That's how you'll stay

[Verse 2]
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am
Unforgettable, too

[Interlude]

[Chorus 2]
Unforgettable
In every way
And forever more
That's how you'll stay

[Verse 2]
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am
Unforgettable, too
