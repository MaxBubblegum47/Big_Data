I was walking along
Mindin' my business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash! Bam! Alakazam!
Wonderful you came by

I was hummin' a tune
Drinkin' in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
Flash! Bam! Alakazam!
I got a look at you

One look and I yelled "timber"
Watch out for flying glass

Cause the ceiling fell in
And the bottom fell out
I went in to a spin
And i started to shout
"I've been hit, this is it, I, T, it!"

I was walking along
Mindin' my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash! Bam! Alakazam!
Out of the orange colored sky

Well, one look and I yelled "timber"
Watch out for flying glass

Cause the ceiling fell in
And the bottom fell out
I went in to a spin
And i started to shout
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it, I, T, it!"

I was walkin' along
Mindin' my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash! Bam! Alakazam!
Out of that orange colored
Purple striped
Pretty green polka-dot sky
Flash! Bam!
Alakazam and goodbye!
