[Refrain 1]
Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma

[Verse 1]
Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearing two by two
On an evening in Roma
Do they take 'em for espresso?
Yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm, a girl I wish I knew
On an evening in Roma

[Verse 2]
Though there's grinning and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down

[Verse 3]
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and that's one too few
On an evening in Roma

[Refrain 2]
Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome, do as the Romans do
Will you, on an evening in Roma?

[Refrain 1]
Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma

[Refrain 2]
Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome, do as the Romans do
Will you, on an evening in Roma?

[Outro]
Sott'er celo de Roma
On an evening in Roma
