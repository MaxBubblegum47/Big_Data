[Verse 1]
How lucky can one guy be
I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said
Ain't that a kick in the head?

[Verse 2]
The room was completely black
I hugged her and she hugged back
Like the sailor said, quote
"Ain't that a hole in the boat"

[Chorus]
My head keeps spinning
I go to sleep and keep grinning
If this is just the beginning
My life is gonna be beautiful

[Verse 3]
I've sunshine enough to spread
It's just like the fella said
Tell me quick ain't love like a kick in the head?

[Bridge]
Like the fella once said
Ain't love like a kick in the head?

Like the sailor said, quote
"Ain't that a hole in the boat?"

[Chorus]
My head keeps spinning
I go to sleep and keep grinning
If this is just the beginning
My life is gonna be beautiful

[Outro]
She's telling me we'll be wed
She's picked out a king size bed
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick
Tell me quick, oh, ain't love a kick?
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?
