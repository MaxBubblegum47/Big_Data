[Intro: Choir]
In Napoli where love is king
When boy meets girl
Here's what they say

[Chorus: Dean Martin]
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie, that's amore
When the world seems to shine
Like you've had too much wine, that's amore

[Bridge: Dean Martin]
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling
Ting-a-ling-a-ling and you'll sing, "Vita bella"
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay
Tippy-tippy-tay like a gay tarantella

[Verse: Dean Martin]
When the stars make you drool
Just like a pasta e fagioli, that's amore
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love
When you walk in a dream
But you know, you're not dreaming signore
Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli, that's amore

[Chorus: Choir & (Dean Martin)]
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie, that's amore (That's amore)
When the world seems to shine
Like you've had too much wine, that's amore (That's amore)

[Bridge: Choir & (Dean Martin)]
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling
Ting-a-ling-a-ling and you'll sing, "Vita bella, vita bella, vita bella"
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay
Tippy-tippy-tay like a gay tarantella
(Lucky fella)

[Verse: Dean Martin & Choir]
When the stars make you drool
Just like a pasta e fazul, that's amore (That's amore)
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love
When you walk in a dream
But you know, you're not dreaming signore
Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli, that's amore

[Outro: Dean Martin]
That's amore
