Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
Up on the housetop
Ho, ho, ho

Up on the house top reindeers pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, Christmas joys

Ho ho ho, oh, who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop
Click click click
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick

First comes the stocking of little Nell
Ol' dear Santa fill it well
Give her a dolly that laughs and cries
One that can open and shut its eyes

Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?
Up on the house top, click click click
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick

Look in the stocking of little Bill
Oh just see what a glorious fill
Here is a hammer and lots of tacks
A whistle and a ball and a whip that cracks

Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?
Up on the house top, click click click
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick

Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?
Oh, up on the house top, click click click
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick
