[Intro]
I'm always in my feelings, oh
I'm always in my feelings
Always in my feelings
(
I said, oh-oh
)

[Verse 1]
You ain't gotta tell nobody
Acting like you know somebody
Just had to let you know
I'm just bad for the soul
And you know I'm not shit
'Cause I'm selfish and it is what it is
And I can't help it, creepin' on the low
And I be fuckin' different hoes

[Chorus]
But you still gon' come through (Come through)
Come through, come through
Come through (Come through)
Come through
'Cause you know I got options (Options)
All this talking ain't up for discussion
I just be cheating on the low
Kickin' it with different hoes
Invite 'em to all my shows and you don't even know
No, you don't even know
Line 'em up and shoot my shot like motherfuckin' free throws

[Verse 2]
You know I got options
'Cause I'm fucked up and I'm double cupped
And my head hurt and my mind stuck, yeah
And you know I got options
'Cause you in pain and I'm not
Give you everything that I got
Got your stomach filled up with knots
Throwed like promethazine
I can't keep letting these temptations get the best of me
I seen this cover girl, she hopped up out a magazine
And you gon' tell me you different but that's okay to me

[Chorus]
But you still gon' come through (Come through)
Come through, come through
Come through (Come through)
Come through
'Cause you know I got options (Options)
All this talking ain't up for discussion
I just be cheating on the low
Kickin' it with different hoes
Invite 'em to all my shows and you don't even know
No, you don't even know
Line 'em up and shoot my shot like motherfuckin' free throws
