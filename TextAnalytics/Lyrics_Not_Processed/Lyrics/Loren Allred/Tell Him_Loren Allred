I'm scared
So afraid to show I care
Maybe he's in love, I'd feel like a fool
Life can be so cruel, Don't know what to do
I've been there with my heart out in my hand
But what you must understand
You can't let the chance to love him pass you by

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes, reach out to him
And whisper tender words, so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Touch him, ooh
With the gentleness you feel inside, I feel it
Your love can't be denied, the truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be, all in time, you'll see

Ooh, I love him
Then show him
Of that much I can be sure
All thanks to you
I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes, reach out to him
And whisper tender words, so soft and sweet
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Love is the light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Blind faith will lead love where it has to go

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes, reach out to him
And whisper, whisper words, so soft and sweet
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself
Ooh, Ooh
Never let him go
