[Verse 1]
Last year, same time
You were laughing with tears in your eyes
It was still Spring, cold nights
You'd be warming your hand in mine

[Pre-Chorus]
But when seasons change
Nothing lasts
There is one thing I ask

[Chorus]
I bet we could fall in love
This Summer
This Summer
I bet we could fall in love
This Summer
This Summer
Just close your eyes
Pretend for awhile
The world’s not on fire
And we’ll be alright
I bet we could fall in love
This Summer
This Summer

[Verse 2]
When thе wind blows
And nothing grows
The leaves will covеr the grass
I remember, last September
Felt like walking on broken glass

[Pre-Chorus]
But then seasons change
Nothing lasts
There is one thing I ask

[Chorus]
I bet we could fall in love
This Summer
This Summer
I bet we could fall in love
This Summer
This Summer
Just close your eyes
Pretend for awhile
The world’s not on fire
And we’ll be alright
I bet we could fall in love
This Summer
This Summer

[Bridge]
Just kiss me
Feel my skin
Under the sun
Take my hand
Hold on tight
While we run
Just take me back
Make this moment last

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
Pretend for awhile
The world’s not on fire
And we’ll be alright
I bet we could fall in love
This Summer
This Summer

[Outro]
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
This Summer
Oh oh oh
This Summer
