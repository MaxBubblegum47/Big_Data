[Pre-Hook]
Can’t get involved too deeply
Can’t set myself up for letdowns
Get on them bars, get sleepy
Grab a lil bitch and go lay it down
Can’t even remember my weekend
Barely can get up the next day
All I know that I stay getting paid
Chain on the floor by my Michael Js

[Hook]
Couple lil bitches was ready
Chopper on side of me ready
One in the head, that bitch ready
Did you not think I was ready?
I just told Ray that she ready
Got to go’n push it on out to the block
Got to go’n push it on out to the street
Whatever, do it heavy, young nigga be ready

[Verse 1]
We be like bitch I gotta get 100 P’s
A hundred P’s, I got to get ‘em
Give a fuck with my niggas 'dem done did
Cause wrong or right, my nigga riding with ‘em
24 7, riding with this chopper bitch
Riding with this chopper, yeah
We can afford some problems, yeah
I can afford some problems
Be the one, I’ll lay it down
Bad bitches, I just lay ‘em down
No emotions, I can’t play around
Pop was gone, I made my way around
Through the city, money got to get it
Francis was out shooting dice with me
My bitch she wanted me home with her
Texting and talking on phones with her
I fuck with you but the way a nigga fuck with you
Make it seem like I don’t fuck with you
I don’t hit your phone all the time
You say it make you feel like you ain’t on my mind
How the fuck is you ain’t on my mind
When I just went and helped you go and flip a dime
Why the fuck is these bitches ungrateful
Must be doin’ some’ under the table

You gotta be ready fool

Whatever day, nigga I don’t give a fuck

That’s if you feel I disrespected you
Calling your bitch, chill
You’ll still be my bitch for real
Cause if I’m fucking with you then I call you that
Niggas be talkin’ crazy like they’ll kill something
Nigga you ain’t got the balls for that
I fuck with young niggas, fuck with real niggas
