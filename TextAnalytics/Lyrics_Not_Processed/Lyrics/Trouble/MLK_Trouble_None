[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah, yeah, ayy, woah
Oh, no, no, hold on, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I was havin' a dream
I was whippin' a Rolls-Royce
And I bought everything that I want
Turned to Martin Luther King overnight
Martin Luther King overnight, ayy
I was dead broke, hustlin' off the steps
Now I rock water like I'm Michael Phelps, yeah
Black diamonds, Black History Month
Turned to Martin Luther King overnight

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I was just rollin' the dice, huh
I was just tryna get by, I gambled my life, huh
I fucked around, had a kid and he had to stay fly, whew
I ain't give no fuck, I got fresh from the shit on the side
I pray to God I die off in my sleep
I pray my deaf brother don't run into the police
'Cause you tellin' him to put his hands up, he can't hear
Ain't goin' for deceased
These rookie police need to get trained, even in their sleep
Fuck around, make a nigga put it to your head like Stony
I'ma gon' tell you how to get that cheese, macaroni
Spent all my tour money on the ring
Told 'em, "Go 'head, get everything they fuckin' see," yeah
I grew my shit like I'm Mad Dog
I got a white and a black dog
I spent my day on Adderall
Look in my face, I'm on Adderall
Shawty more P than a Madden ball
Suck on that cat, I'm the baddest, dawg
This sauce, sauce, sauce, sauce
Yeah, gon' pop a bean, John Bean
Paris fashion week shoppin' spree, on me
Hundred thousand dollars, that's big CÃ©lines on me
You better not have to OD on me, ayy
Let's go to people town (Let's go to people town)
Put somethin' in your account, bae

I don't finish last, I win it, huh (Win)
I beat that cat like Nitti, yeah (Woo)
I bought a Jag with a Hemi, skrrt
I throw a flag on these bitches, skrrt
I wrapped up the last of these bitches
Foreign tags and American (Skrrt)
Bring me a milli', I'll marry her, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I was havin' a dream
I was whippin' a Rolls-Royce
And I bought everything that I want
Turned to Martin Luther King overnight
Martin Luther King overnight, ayy
I was dead broke, hustlin' off the steps
Now I rock water like I'm Michael Phelps, yeah
Black diamonds, Black History Month
Turned to Martin Luther King overnight

[Verse 2: Young Thug]

Come ride with me and it'll be gifts and curses
I see you, drinkin' syrup, I see you workin'

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I was havin' a dream

I was dead broke, hustlin' off the steps
Now I rock water like I'm Michael Phelps, yeah
Black diamonds, Black History Month
Turned to Martin Luther King overnight

[Verse 3: Trouble]
It wasn't like you had my back, no (No)

Didn't ever wanna admit to the fact
That your baby boy was contemplatin' dyin' (For real, for real)
In the dream, yeah, I done seen you cryin' (Yeah)
Dream don't compare to what I done seen (Yeah)
They tried to kill me for nothin' (Lived though)
Tell her yeah she got it bussin' (Brrt)

Yeah, I'm smokin' a bag and killed that cat like curiosity
All night I buy some rings and swear by me
