[Intro]
Lil Durk in this motherfucker, gang, Ralo
Fam, ayy where the real niggas at?
You know all the MOB rockin' witcha nigga right here
Ya only the real ones, know what I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hey, them my niggas
Yeah, them my boys
Light him up like he Christmas
If he play with my boys
Yeah, them my dogs, them my boys
Yeah, them my niggas, them my boys
We gon' ball if she get my boys
Yeah, fuck that bitch if you my boy
Yeah, if you my boys

[Verse 1: Ralo]
Had a talk with Thug, we was talkin' 'bout Escobar (Pablo!)
Snitches the only thing a rich nigga stressin' for
Remember we was riding on the MARTA bus
They'd rob the bank before they think 'bout robbing us
We did this shit ourself, we ain't ask for no help
He'll kill for Terrell, I'll kill for lil' Jeff
So now we got right, these niggas went left
Ridin' 'round with them straps, I ain't talkin' seat belts
I swear to God I'll murk 'em if Thugger say the word
We went from robbing these niggas to selling bricks and birds
They had the nerve to say they don't like me riding with Thug
But at first, they liked to see a friend in clubs

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hey, them my niggas
Yeah, them my boys
Light him up like he Christmas
If he play with my boys
Yeah, them my dogs, them my boys
Yeah, them my niggas, them my boys
We gon' ball if she get my boys
Yeah, fuck that bitch if you my boy
Yeah, if you my boys

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
My niggas turnt, we do it
Play crazy smoke like hookah
Rip L'A, what's up Booka
No Metro Boomin, boomin'
One call, they pull up shooting
Splash Brothers said we bool
Roll up some opps in wood
My dogs 'nem, they so cuckoo
Too turnt up for Lil NuNu
My niggas demons, voodoo
They facing shit like ooVoo, yeah
Free the gang, we the gang
That lil' change made him change
We insane, keep a Glock
If he strayin', bow-bow
Rob me, nah-nah
.40 match the sawed off
FN take his wall off
Like where is Waldo?
I'm a street nigga, got my brothers here
So fuck you other niggas if you on some other shit

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hey, them my niggas
Yeah, them my boys
Light him up like he Christmas
If he play with my boys
Yeah, them my dogs, them my boys
Yeah, them my niggas, them my boys
We gon' ball if she get my boys
Yeah, fuck that bitch if you my boy
Yeah, if you my boys

[Verse 3: Trouble]
Hundred shots in the daytime if you ever come play with them, my boy
Ain't no shootin' up no random houses, got to get your man, you got to kill that boy
Free Tre, one of the first niggas to ever put me in that field, my boy
Took cases be just, my boy
Police chasin', we juuged my boy
Godfather, you know that ain't a question
How we rock ain't a question
Y'all still fucking around and got a fresh seven
Man this shit kinda hectic
Painful living, growing up missing daddy
Sister making it better
Why I be there any time that she need me
'Cause I know that she had me
In and out, but I didn't know my daddy
Edgewood, Zone 6 shit, rated savage
Yeah, just a project nigga, ain't never had shit
Young Day, if you hit me, get nasty, pussy

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hey, them my niggas
Yeah, them my boys
Light him up like he Christmas
If he play with my boys
Yeah, them my dogs, them my boys
Yeah, them my niggas, them my boys
We gon' ball if she get my boys
Yeah, fuck that bitch if you my boy
Yeah, if you my boys

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Met that bitch when I was in elementary
Man them my niggas before elementary
They been my niggas ever since elementary
I swung on his teacher 'bout him, yeah in elementary
Stop all the killing and let's go get it
When you buy you a Bentley, you know you rich
Me and Ralo, we like Ace Boogie and Mitch
He was broke now his shit lit up like he hit a lick
Lil' bitch, slob on the dick
Lil' bitty bitch, my diamonds gon' glisten
It's YSL and Fam Goon shit
Lil Durk with me, tonight we throw the racks on the bitch

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hey, them my niggas
Yeah, them my boys
Light him up like he Christmas
If he play with my boys
Yeah, them my dogs, them my boys
Yeah, them my niggas, them my boys
We gon' ball if she get my boys
Yeah, fuck that bitch if you my boy
Yeah, yeah, if you my boys
