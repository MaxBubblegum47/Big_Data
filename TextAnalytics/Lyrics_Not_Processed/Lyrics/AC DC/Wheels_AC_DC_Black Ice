[Verse 1]
She was a danger
Ain't no stranger
You got me rock n rollin'
Around the town
Just fooling around
She going to break you
Wanna make you
Going to make it

[Pre-Chorus]
Want to take it down
She gonna ride you, wanna slide you down

[Chorus]
Wheels
Spinning 'round my brain
Driving you insane
Wheels
Rolling 'round my head
Going through the red

[Verse 2]
She wanna shake you
No way to save you
She got me shot, I'm falling
I'm blowing it out
Know what I am talking about?
She gonna ride you
Want to slide you
Ain't no faking

[Pre-Chorus]
She want to take you out
You bet you're right
She gonna spin you around

[Chorus]
Wheels
Spinning 'round my brain
Driving you insane
Wheels
Rolling 'round my head
Going through the red
Wheels
Flying down the road
Ready to explode
Wheels
Burning up the road
Hitting overload

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Wheels
Ready to explode
