[Verse 1]
Put on the headset, get on the stage
Out on a midnight escapade
Didn't want to steal your thunder
Wouldn't want to play your game
Making all the headlines
Getting on the front page
Didn't even know her number
I didn't even know her name

[Chorus]
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up

[Verse 2]
Get on the red dress, slip on the lace
Up for a high heel and a pretty face
Woman want to get you under
Woman want to get you tame
Loving on a hot night
Stoking up the flame
Didn't want to know her number
I didn't want to know her name

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus] (x2)
