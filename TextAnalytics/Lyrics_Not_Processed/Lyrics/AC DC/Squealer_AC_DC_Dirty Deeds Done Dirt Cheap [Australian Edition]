[Verse 1]
She said she'd never been, hummm
Never been touched before
She said she'd never been
This far before
She said she'd never liked
Mmm, to be excited
She said she always had
Had to fight it
(And she never won)

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she'd never been
Never been balled before
And I don't think, hey
She'll ever ball no more
(Fixed her good)

Hey!

[Chorus]
(Squealer) when I held her hand
(Squealer) I made her understand
(Squealer) when I kissed her lips
(Squealer) sucked her finger tips, hey
(Squealer) ooh started getting hot
(Squealer) ooh made it hard to stop
(Squealer) got too much
(Squealer) I think I've got the magic touch, aaah
(Squealer...)
