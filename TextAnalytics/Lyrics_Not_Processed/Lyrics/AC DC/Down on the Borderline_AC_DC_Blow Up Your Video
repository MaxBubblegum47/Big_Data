Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
She's an idle child, high society
Never pushed a broom, didn't physically
Her eyes are down on you, her nose is up
Never spill your whiskey when she fill your cup

[Chorus]
I'm on the borderline
On the borderline

[Verse 2]
She goes struttin' 'round, and she shows so much
With a neon sign saying, "Don't you touch"
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
She use me like an anchor, got a hold on me

[Chorus]
(On the borderline) See the danger sign
(On the borderline) Gettin' outta line
(On the borderline) But it feels so good
(On the borderline)
On the borderline
On the borderline
Borderline

[Verse 3]
You know, I shoot the dice to climb the money tree
But the poker man dealt a foul to me
She doesn't want you when your pocket's dry
The queen of hearts will kill you when your ace is high

[Chorus]
On the borderline
On the borderline

[Solo]

[Verse 1 (Reprise)]
She's an idle child, high society
Never pushed a broom, didn't physically
Her eyes are down on you, her nose is up
Never spill your whiskey when she fill your cup

[Chorus]
(On the borderline) See the danger sign
(On the borderline) Gettin' outta line
(On the borderline) But it feels so good
(On the borderline)
On the borderline
On the borderline, yeah
On the borderline, feelin' good
I'm on the borderline, yeah
Borderline
Yeah, they're gonna meet you there
Oh yeah

I'm goin' across the borderline
I'm on the borderline, can you take it?
On the borderline, you might love it
On the borderline
If you want me, yes
Meet me on the borderline
