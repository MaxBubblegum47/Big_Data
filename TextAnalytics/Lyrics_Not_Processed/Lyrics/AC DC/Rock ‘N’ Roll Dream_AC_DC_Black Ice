[Verse 1]
Deep water all around me
And circle sharks all about
Deep in trouble
And I may turn around
Man up, and one man down
You pretty women, gather 'round
You can't pick up not a single sound
You feel you're winning, that's what it's all about
Knowing you weren't winning
And it could be the very last time

[Chorus]
I could be in a rock n roll dream
I could be in a rock n roll dream

[Verse 2]
Circle sharks all about you
You come up and you don't know why
Where goes a woman with a warm embrace?
Does a man walk in the hard rain?
I'm amazed that they mess you around
You're coming up, and they're standing next in line
Give it a line and dive, run close
Hear me hollering, I get the most

[Chorus] [x2]

[Bridge]
Circle sharks, down and 'round
Deep water all around, 'round, 'round
Deep water all around and 'round

[Chorus] [x2]
