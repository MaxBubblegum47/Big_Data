[Verse 1]
Honey, roll over, and lettuce on top
Strap you to the bed and make you rock
Run it up the flag, send it on home
Push you to the wall, an' make you moan

[Pre-Chorus]
She's mine, take what I want
Get what I need, don't take it all
So, don't you hide, I'm gonna blow my mind
Come on, taste it, honey, 'cause she feel fine

[Chorus]
She turn it on
Upside down
She turn me on
Inside out
She turn it on
All around
She turn me on
She turn it on

[Verse 2]
Honey, bend over, touch your toes
She take over, the bomb explodes
A rocking rollercoaster, flying over top
Take you high diving, off a long drop
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She's mine, take what I want
Get what I need, don't take it all
Don't you hide, I wanna blow my mind
Come on, taste it, honey, 'cause she feel fine

[Chorus]
She turn it on
Upside down
She turn me on
Inside out
She turn it on
All around
She turn me on
She turn it on

[Bridge]
Yeah
She turn me on

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
She's mine, take what I want
Get what I need, don't take it all
Don't you hide, going to blow my mind
Come on, taste it, honey, 'cause she feel fine

[Bridge 2]
Yeah
Ooh, yow

[Chorus]
She turn it on
Upside down
She turn me on
Inside out
She turn it on
All around
She turn me on
She turn it on

[Outro]
She turn it on
She turn me on
She turn it on
She turn me on
Yow
She keep a-turning me on
She keep a-turning me on
She keep a-turning me on
She keep a-turning me on
Yeah, she keep a-turning me on
She keep a-turning me on
She keep a-turning me on
She keep a-turning me on
She turn me on
On and on
She keep a-turning me on
She keep a-turning me on
