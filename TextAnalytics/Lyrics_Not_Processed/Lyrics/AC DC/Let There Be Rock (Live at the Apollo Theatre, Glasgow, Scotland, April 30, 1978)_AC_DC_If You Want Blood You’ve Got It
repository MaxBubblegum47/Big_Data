[Verse 1]
In the beginning
Back in nineteen-fifty-five
Man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show
An' all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "Let there be sound"
There was sound
"Let there be light"
There was light
"Let there be drums"
There was drums
"Let there be guitar"
There was guitar

[Chorus]
Oh, let there be rock

[Solo 1]

[Verse 2]
And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
And all across the land, every rockin' band
Was blowing up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The business man got rich
And in every bar, there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There were fifteen-million fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say:

[Pre-Chorus]
"Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar"

[Chorus]
Oh, let there be rock

[Solo 2]

[Verse 3]
One night, in the club called, "The Shaking Hand"
There was a 42 decibel rockin' band
And the music was good, and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd:

[Chorus]
"Let there be rock"
