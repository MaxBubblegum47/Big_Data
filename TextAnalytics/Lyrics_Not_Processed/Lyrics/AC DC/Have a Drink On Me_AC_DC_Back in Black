[Verse 1]
Whiskey, gin and brandy
With a glass, I'm pretty handy
I'm tryin' to walk a straight line
On sour mash and cheap wine

[Pre-Chorus]
So, join me for a drink, boys
We're gonna make a big noise
So, don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check, we'll get hell to pay

[Chorus]
Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me

[Verse 2]
I'm dizzy, drunk and fighting
On tequila, white lightnin'
Yes, my glass is gettin' shorter
On whiskey, ice and water

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, so come on, have a good time
And get blinded out of your mind
So, don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check, we'll get hell to pay

[Hook]
Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me tonight
Get stoned

[Bridge]
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Come on

[Outro]
Going another round
Gonna hit the ground
Take another swig
Have another drink
Gonna drink you dry
Gonna get me high
Come on, all the boys make a noise

Have a drink on me (Have a drink on me)
Have a drink on me (Have a drink on me)
Ah, have a drink on me (Have a drink on me)

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink
On me
