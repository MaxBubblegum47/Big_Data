Keep your head down

[Verse 1]
I
I want you
I want you to
I want you to march
Eyes goes right, shoulder arms
Left wheel turn, show your charms
Change your clothes, cut your hair
Ain't no joke, ain't no place for kids

[Pre-Chorus]
When the flags are high, hear the battle cry
Treaty gone, see the bandit fly
Dig that trench, watch that blast
Shell-shock come, comin' fast
Name and rank, on parade
We might get laid by a hand grenade
Do you know what it means?
Do you know what it means?
This
Means
War

[Chorus]
This means war
This means war
This means war
I said this means war
This means war
This means war
The bullet got your number on it

[Bridge]
Run for cover
Hit the dirt
Call for your mother

[Verse 2]
I
I need you
I need you to
I need you to fire
Cock your gun, wet your sights
Get the bull, dead to rights
Volunteer, one pace back
On the beach
Ain't no place for kids

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the flack is high on the bomber run
You don't talk back to an ack-ack gun
Fire rage, and you're in a blitz
Keep your head, or you're blown to bits
Name and rank on parade
Might get laid by a hand grenade
You know what it means?
Do you know what it means?
This
Means
War

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Who go there is it friend or foe?
Propaganda time on the radio
Top brass shout as they clown around
And peace talks die in Geneva town
Do you know what it means? (This means war)
Do you know what it means? (This means war)
Do you know what it means? (This means war)
Do you know what it means? (This means...)

[Chorus](x2)
Where's the Seventh Calvary?

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
This means war
Told you before
I said, this means war
You know the score
I said, this means war
This means war
This
Means
War
You're all dead
