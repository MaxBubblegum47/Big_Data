Hey, what's the furor?

[Verse 1]
Kick the dust, wipe the crime from the main street
Await the coming of The Lord
Hanging 'round with them low down and dirties
Bringing order from the boss
What's the furor 'bout it all?
Leave you panting, bust your balls
Kicked around, messed about, get your hands dirty
On the killing floor

[Chorus]
I'm your furor
I'm your furor, baby
Come on, yeah

[Verse 2]
Frame of mind, cross the line to a new state
I can shake the law
Friend of mine gonna build me a new place
Not knocking door-to-door

[Chorus]
I'm your furor
I'm your furor, baby
What's your furor?
I'm your furor, baby

[Bridge]
Bring on the furor
C'mon

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Well, I'm your furor
What's your furor, baby?
Feel the furor
I'm your furor, baby
I'm your furor
What's your furor, baby?
Feel the furor
You're my furor

I'm your furor
I'm your furor
