[Verse 1]
Black sheep and a renegade
Hot feet in the cool of the shade
Street jungle in the tough-child 'hoods
Examinations done no good
Ghetto bars and hot wired cars
Sneak thieves and cheap cigars
No rebellion, not today

[Pre-Chorus]
I get my kicks in my own way
Right, okay

[Chorus]
Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule

[Verse 2]
Tough breaks in the neighborhood
A hard case who's up to no good
Living like trash, a society rash
Ready to break, and ready to dash
A bad deal and a real rough ride
I'm doing time on the other side
No rebellion, not today

[Pre-Chorus]
I get my kicks in my own way
Right, okay

[Chorus]
Tough breaks

[Solo]

[Bridge]
They got regulation ties
Regulation shoes
Those regulation fools
With their regulation rules

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, take off your ties and your regulation shoes
You're nothing but a bunch of regulation fools, yeah
And your damn regulation rules
I'm going to do things my own way
Every day, every day, every day
In every way
I ain't gonna pay no attention to your rules
