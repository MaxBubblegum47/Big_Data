[Verse 1]
Ridin' down the highway
Goin' to a show
Stoppin' on the byways
Playin' rock 'n' roll

[Pre-Chorus]
Gettin' robbed, gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up, broken boned
Getting had, getting took
I tell you folks, it's harder than it looks

[Chorus 1]
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doing one night stands
Try playing in a rock-roll band
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll

[Bagpipes Solo]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Hotel, motel
Make you want to cry
Ladies do the hard sell
Know the reason why

[Pre-Chorus]
Gettin' old, gettin' gray
Gettin' ripped off, underpaid
Gettin' sold, second-hand
That's how it goes, playin' in a band

[Chorus]
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out, it's rough and mean
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll

[Outro]
Well, it's a long way
Oh, it's a long way
(You should have told me)
It's a long way
Such a long way
