[Verse 1]
Take up all your time
Kick up your heels, looking fine
And you come riding blind
You come rolling back a while

[Pre-Chorus]
Wind a-blowing on, yeah
We're gonna move on and on
Sweating heat soak you all
Beat it out, I'll make you crawl all night

[Chorus]
Decibel[x2]

[Verse 2]
Has you from deep inside
You were waving then you smiled

[Pre-Chorus]
Debonair rock and roll
Very loud
Louder than rain
Cool, in there rocking, standing proud

[Chorus]
Decibel
That's the history of rock n roll
Decibel

[Verse 3]
When I've called on
We're going to ride along
A hundred miles, in all
Betting in night 'til dawn
Spread the joy coming on
Yeah, hard and long
Slide right down
With a shock, hit the ground

[Chorus]
Decibel[x3]
You come rolling back a while
Decibel
