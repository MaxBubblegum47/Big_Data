[Intro]
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the day
I just can't wait till Christmas time
When I can roll you in the hay

[Verse 1]
Easy come, easy go
Have a good time with lots of dough
Slipping up high, slipping down low
Love 'em and leave 'em, on with the show
Yes

Ah-ah-ah
Alright

Listen
I like female form in minimum dress
Money to spend with a capital "S"
Get a date with the woman in red
Want to be in heaven with three in a bed
Said, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
He got it, I want it
They got it, I can't have it
But I want it, but it don't matter
She got it, and I can't get it

[Chorus]
I want a mistress for Christmas
I want a mistress for Christmas
Oh, yeah

Ha-ha
I want a mistress for Christmas
Come on

Easy come, easy go
Slipping high, slipping low

She got it, and I can't get it

He got it, and I want it
(For Christmas)
They got it, and I can't have it

But I want it, it don't matter

She got it, and I can't get a

[Chorus]
Mistress for Christmas (You know what I'm talking about)
(Mistress for Christmas)
You got to send her down
You got to send her down
(Mistress for Christmas)
I want the woman in red at the bottom of my bed
Mistress for Christmas

[Outro]
I can hear you coming down my smoke stack, yeah
I want to ride on your reindeer, honey, and ring my bells, yeah
