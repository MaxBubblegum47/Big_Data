[Intro]
The following is a true story
Only the names have been changed
To protect the guilty

[Verse 1]
Well, I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothing's gonna stop us, no, nothing
So if you've got the money, we've got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down
If you've got the dollar, we've got the song
Just want to boogie-woogie all night long
Yeah, boogie
I got holes in my shoes
I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks
I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million
And I got patches on the patches
On my old blue jeans
Well, they used to be blue
When they used to be new
When they used to be clean
But I've got a Mamma who's a hummer
Just keeping me alive
While I'm in the band, doin' drinking with the boys
She's working 9-to-5
(She knows her place, that woman)
Just you wait
One of these days, see me driving 'round town
In my Rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sunroof down
My bottle of booze, no summer time blues
Shouting out, "Mom, look at me"
In my rock 'n' roll voice

[Chorus](x2)
No, it ain’t no fun, yeah
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No, it ain’t no fun
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Do you believe me?
It ain't no fun, no
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
It ain’t no fun, (I don't care what they say)
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Drive a Rolls Royce car
No it ain’t no fun, and you know it
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No, no, no, no , no, no, no
No, ain't no fun
Waitin' 'round to be a millionaire

[Outro]
My million dollar scream
But it ain't no fun (ain't no fun) oh, no
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun), that's what I said!
Well, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun) and I wanna be rich
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
Ain't no fun diggin' this ditch
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
You better believe me
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
Well, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
I ain't havin' no fun (ain't no fun)
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire, no, no
Ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No, ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun waitin' 'round to be a millionaire
"Hey, hello Howard
What the hell are you doing, friend?
Next door neighbor
Oh yeah
Get your fucking jumbo jet outta my airport!"
