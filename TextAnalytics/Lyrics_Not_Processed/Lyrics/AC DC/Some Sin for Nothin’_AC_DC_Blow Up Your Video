[Verse 1]
Heroes, hard to find
Don't make the news 'till they're doin' time
Schemers turn the screw
They get the word and they drop on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay down the law, black of the night
Run up a score, ooh the vice is right
Dealers looking 'round, wheel is turning 'round
Coming 'round on you
Yeah

[Chorus]
Some sin for gold
Some sin for shame
Some sin for cash
Some sin for gain
Some sin for wine
Some sin for pain
But I ain't gonna be the fool
Who's gonna have to sin for nothing, no
Nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Nero, evil mind
He was born way before his time
Lead on, down below
You got it right and away you go

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta lay down the rules, push up the price
Turn on the heat, put you on ice
Dealers looking 'round, wheel is turning 'round
Coming 'round for you

[Chorus][x2]

Ain't gonna sin for nothing
You get nothing for nothing
Ain't gonna sin for nothing
That don't make no sense, no, no
