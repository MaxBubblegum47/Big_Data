[Verse 1]
Woo!
One, Two
Out on the town, looking for a woman
Gonna give me good love
Anybody want to hang out with me?
And give me plenty of...
She was standing alone over by the jukebox
Like she's something to sell
I said, "Baby what's the going price?"
She told me to go to hell

[Chorus 1]
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain’t it a shame
To be shot down in flames?

[Verse 2]
Singles bar, got my eye on a honey
Hanging out everywhere
She might be straight
She might want my money
I really don't care, no
Said, "Baby, you're driving me crazy"
Laid it right on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
"Toss off, buddy, she's mine"

[Chorus 1]
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain’t it a shame
To be shot down in flames?

[Bridge]
Hey you, Angus, shoot me, shoot!
That's nice, woah!

[Chorus 1]
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain’t it a shame
To be shot down in flames?

[Chorus 1]
Shot
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain’t it a shame
To be shot down in flames?

[Outro]
I don't need the pain
Don't want to be shot down in flames
Ohhh
