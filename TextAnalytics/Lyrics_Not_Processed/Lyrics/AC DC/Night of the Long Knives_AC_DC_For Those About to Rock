[Verse 1]
Who's  your leader, who's your man?
Who will help you fill your hand?
Who's your friend and who's your foe?
Who's your Judas?
You don't know

[Chorus]
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long, long knife

[Verse 2]
Where's that savior, where's that light
When you're praying for your life?
Who's that fighting back to back?
Who's defending whose attack?

[Chorus]
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long, long knife
Stab him in the back once!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long, long knife
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long, long knife
