[Verse 1]
Ya gotta see me leanin' on the bar
I got my head in a whiskey jar
Feelin' good, 'cause the city's alive
I'm gettin' ready to rock and jive
I get up and I slide across the floor
You want to come or I'll meet you at the door?
No one can stop us 'cause we're feeling too right
We're gonna steal our way around the night
Alright, alright

[Chorus]
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake

[Verse 2]
I was takin' no liberties
She getting hotter off the heat on me
I was oilin', she was slick
Lickin' off the sweat, her favorite trick, yeah
"Help me, help me please (yes)
Tame this animal, help me to breathe"
I said, "No, no way
You gotta come with me all of the way"
"Okay, I'll play"

[Chorus]
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it

[Verse 3]
We had the night, we had the time
She had the sugar and I had the wine
Took my hand, shook me to the core
Told me not to touch, but she was coming back for more
You know what for
Aye, aye, aye, aye

[Chorus]
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Make you shake
