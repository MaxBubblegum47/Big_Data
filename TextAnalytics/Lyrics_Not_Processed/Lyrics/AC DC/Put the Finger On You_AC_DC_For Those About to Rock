Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I put the finger on you, yeah
My hand's all out of control
I can't stop it getting down on you
It's moving on it's own accord
Yes

[Pre-Chorus]
I got fire in my finger tips
Radiating off to you
I can't control it, can't even hold it
It's knocking on your door
And you know what it's for

[Chorus]
I put the finger right on you
I put the finger right on you
You put your finger on me, too
Then, I put the finger, I put the finger
Yeah, I put the finger, I put the finger

[Verse 2]
I put the finger on you, for sure
It's a key to unlocking your door
Don't you know, I
I've broken through your security
My hands ain't tied no more
You better watch out

[Pre-chrous]
I can't control it, can't even hold it
Sticking up for your pleasure
You can feel it on your ankle
Feel it on your knee
Feel it on your thigh
Can you feel me?

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't control it, can't even hold it
Sticking up for your pleasure
You can feel it on your ankle
Feel it on your knee
Feel it on your thigh
Can you feel me?

[Bridge]
Put it - (Right on you)
Put it - (Right on you)
I'll do it, if you (Want me to)
Can I put it?
Can I put it?

[Outro]
I put the finger on you
So close
I hit the spot
I put the finger
Right on
You
