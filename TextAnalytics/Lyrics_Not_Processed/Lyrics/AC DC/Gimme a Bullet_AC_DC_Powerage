[Intro]
Ow!

[Verse 1]
She had the word, had the way
The way of letting me know
She knew the game, called the play
Oh, she hit me low
Said, "Now you go your way, I'll go mine"
And that's the start
Doctor, doctor, ainâ€™t no cure for the pain in my heart

[Chorus]
Give me a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Give me a bullet to bite on, and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

[Verse 2]
Don't need no drink, don't need no drugs
Don't need no sympathy
Sooner or later, send me a bill for what she's doin' to me
Operator, long distance lips on the telephone
Come tomorrow, come to grips with being all alone

[Chorus]
Give me a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Give me a bullet to bite on, and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

[Outro]
A bullet to bite on
Give me a bullet to bite on
Oh, yeah, come on, now
Yeah, yeah, gimme a bullet (bullet to bite on)
Oh, yeah, bullet to chew
I'll make believe it's you (bullet to bite on)
I'll make believe it's you
Give me a bullet to bite on
Oh, you're a bullet, baby
I want a bullet to bite on
