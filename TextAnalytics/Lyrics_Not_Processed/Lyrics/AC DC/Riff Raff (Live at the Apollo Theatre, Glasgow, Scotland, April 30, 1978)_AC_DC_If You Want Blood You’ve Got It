[Verse 1]
See it on television, every day
Ya hear it on the radio
It ain’t humid, but it sure is hot
Down in Mexico
A barmaid's tryin' to tell me (ha-ha)
"Beginning of the end"
Sayin' it'll bend me
Too late, my friend

[Chorus]
Riff Raff
Oh, it's good for a laugh
Ha-ha-ha
Riff Raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
Smile a while

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm the kinda guy that keeps his big mouth shut
It don't bother me
Somebody kickin' me when I'm up
Leave me in misery
I never shot nobody
Don't even carry a gun
I ain’t done nothin' wrong
I'm just having fun

[Chorus]
Riff Raff
Oh, it's good for a laugh
Ha-ha-ha
Riff Raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
Smile a while
Do it again
