[Verse 1]
Blinded by a bright beam
Shattered by the windscreen
Stung by the whiplash
I'm a victim of a bad crash

[Pre-Chorus]
I can do nothing right
I never sleep at night
Can't even start a fight
Oh, my feet have left the ground
Spinnin' round and round

[Chorus]
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down

[Verse 2]
Bleedin' by a blind bend
Wrong way up a dead end
Screamin' through a speed trap
As I tear into a tailback

[Pre-Chorus]
You know
I can do nothing right
No I, I never sleep at night
And I can't even start a fight
Well, my feet have left the ground
Spinnin' round and round

[Chorus]
C'mon, slide!

[Solo]
I'm slipping down

[Bridge]
I got my hands in the fire

[Verse 3]
Ooh, I'm sliding on an oil slick
Burnin on a bad trip
Yes, and nothing's gonna change it

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can do nothing right
Can't even sleep at night
My feet have left the ground
I'm spinning round and round

[Chorus]
