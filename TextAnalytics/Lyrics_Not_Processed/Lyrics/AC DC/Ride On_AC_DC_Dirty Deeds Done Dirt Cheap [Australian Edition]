[Verse 1]
It's another lonely evening
In another lonely town
But I ain’t too young to worry
And I ain’t too old to cry
When a woman gets me down
Got another empty bottle
And another empty bed
Ain’t too young to admit it
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm going to do...

[Chorus]
I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
(Ride on) Standing on the edge of the road
(Ride on) Thumb in the air
(Ride on) One of these days I'm gonna change my evil ways
Till then I'll just keep riding on

[Solo 1]

[Verse 2]
Broke another promise
And I broke another heart
But I ain’t too young to realize
That I ain’t too old to try
Try to get back to the start
And it's another red-light nightmare
Woah, an' another red-light street
And I ain’t too old to hurry
Cause I ain’t too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm lonely
Lord I'm lonely
What am I gonna do?

[Chorus]
I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
(Ride on) Got myself a one-way ticket
(Ride on) Goin' the wrong way
(Ride on) Gonna change my evil ways
... one of these days
One of these days...

[Solo 2]

[Chorus]
I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
Ride on
Ride on, Lookin' for a truck
Ride on, Keep on riding
Ridin' on and on and on and on and on and on and on

Have myself a good time
Mmm, yeah
Ride, ride, ride
One of these days
One of these days...
