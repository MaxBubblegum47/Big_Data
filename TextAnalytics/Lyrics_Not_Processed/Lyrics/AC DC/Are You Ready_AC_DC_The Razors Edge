[Intro]
(Are you ready?)
Are you ready?
(Are you ready?)
Are you ready?
(Are you ready?)
Are you ready?

[Verse 1]
Sweet apple pie
Standing in the street
Hands outta line
Looking for some meat
She take you high
When you feel her steel
She make you fly
And you know you're comin'

[Pre-Chorus]
(Who all need it? (Who?))
(Who all need it? (You!))
(Who all need it, who all need it?)
Yes, you do
(You all breathe it)
We all need it

[Chorus]
Are you ready for a good time?
Then, get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time?
Then, get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time?

[Verse 2]
She makin' eyes
At everything she meet
It ain't a crime
When she make you pump heat
She make you fly
Because that's her thing
She make you dry
Then you know you're broken in

[Pre-Chorus]
(Who all need it? (Who?))
(Who all need it? (You!))
(Who all need it, who all need it?)
Yes, you do
(You all breathe it)
We all need it

[Chorus]
Are you ready for a good time?
Then, get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time?
Then, get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time?

Get ready!

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
(Who all need it, who all need it?)
(You all breathe it)
We all breathe it

[Chorus]
Are you ready for a good time?
Then, get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time?
(Are you ready for a good time?)
Are you ready?
(Are you ready for a good time?)
I want a good time
(Are you ready for a good time?)
Are ya - are you ready?
(Are you ready for a good time?)
Good, good, good, good time
(Are you ready for a good time?)
Are you ready, ready, ready?
(Are you ready for a good time?)
Are you ready for a good time?
Yeah
