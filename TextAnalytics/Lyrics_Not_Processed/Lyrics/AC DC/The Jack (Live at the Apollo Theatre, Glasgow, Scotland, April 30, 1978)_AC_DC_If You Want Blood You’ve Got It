[Verse 1]
She gave me the Queen
She gave me the King
She was wheelin' and dealin'
Just doin' her thing
She was holdin' a pair
But I had to try
Her Deuce was wild
But my Ace was high

[Pre-Chorus]
But how was I to know
That she'd been dealt with before?
Said she'd never had a Full House
But I should have known
From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
She'd have the card to bring me down
If she played it right

[Chorus]
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was her game
If she knew she could get you
She played 'em fast
And she played 'em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card

[Pre-Chorus]
But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before?
Said she'd never had a Royal Flush
But I should have known
That all the cards were coming
From the bottom of the pack
And if I'd known what she was dealing out
I'd have dealt it back

[Chorus]
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, and who knows what else!
She's got the jack, yeah, yeah
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

[Chorus]
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

[Outro]
