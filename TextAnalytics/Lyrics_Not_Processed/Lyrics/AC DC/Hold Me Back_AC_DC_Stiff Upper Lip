[Verse 1]
I got a big, fat Cadillac built for you
I got a honk that'll blow the avenue
Got a hard enough kicking, now bend my thing
Got a sugar looking woman with a bald-headed man
Give me Five-0, here boy, that's what I'll do
Got a big fat mama who can hold a tune
Gotta slip that bone in hard and mean
A honky-tonk woman got the best of me

[Chorus]
Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back, you get a heart attack
Can't hold me back

[Verse 2]
Got a honky-tonk big bone, hit to thrill
I got a sugar boot 'n' money babies that'll kill
All honky tonk 15 golden mile
Got a blonde-headed woman loaded in the town
You can get me to the ball, man, divin' in
And don't balk the kill, ball in her 'ville
You gotta a map the wrong town, hit the road
You got a whole boppa movin' on down the road

[Chorus] (x5)
