[Verse 1]
Well, if you're looking for trouble
I'm the man to see
If you're looking for satisfaction
I'm satisfaction guaranteed

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm as cool as a body on ice
Hotter than the rolling dice
Send you to heaven
Take you to hell
I ain't fooling, can't you tell?

[Chorus]
I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire
Going to set this town on fire

[Verse 2]
And if you need some lovin'
And if you need some man
You've got the phone and the number
And I got no future plans

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, come on honey, you've got nothing to lose
You got the thirst 'n' I've got the booze
Give you an inch
Take you a mile
I want to make you fry

[Chorus]
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
Holy smoke and sweet desire

Like a hot rod, baby

Oh, stick this in your fuse box!

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, cooler than a body on ice
Hotter than the rolling dice
Wilder than a drunken fight
You're going to burn tonight

[Chorus]
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
And I'm gonna set this town on fire

Live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
Well, I'm your live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
Look at me burn
Ow, let me
Meltin'
Short my circuit
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
