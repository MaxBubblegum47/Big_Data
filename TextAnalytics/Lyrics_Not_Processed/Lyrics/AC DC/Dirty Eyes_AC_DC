[Intro]
You hypnotize

[Verse 1]
Honey
Yeah honey
You do it
Woooo, do it good
Do it all right
Every night
When you turn off the light
It's out of sight
(alright)

[Chorus]
You hypnotize
Mezmorize
With your dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Your dirty eyes

[Verse 2]
Breathing
Breathing heavy
Heavy
Heavy breathing
Send shivers down my spine
(make me/and (I'm/you're)) so glad that you are mine
(when you're so bad and you are mine)
That's what turns me on
All night long

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Dirty eyes
I love your dirty eyes
Right through me
Your dirty eyes
