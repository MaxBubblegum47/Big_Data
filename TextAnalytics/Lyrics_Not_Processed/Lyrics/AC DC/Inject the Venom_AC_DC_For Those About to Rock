[Bridge]
No mercy for the bad, if they want it
No mercy for the bad, if they plead
No mercy for the bad, if they need it
Ooh, no mercy from me

[Verse 1]
Tell no truth and tell no lies
Cross your heart and hope to die
Never give what you can't take back
Scratch like a cat
Inject your venom
It'll be your last attack
Ow!

[Bridge]
No mercy for the bad, if they want it
No mercy for the bad, if they plead
No mercy for the bad, if they need it
V - E - N-O-M

[Verse 2]
Got no heart, no
Feel no pain
Take your soul and leave a stain, yeah
Come choose your victim
Take him by surprise
Go in hard and get him
Right between the eyes
And

[Chorus]
Inject the venom
Inject the venom
Inject the venom
Inject it all, ow
Ooh, stick it in
Stick it

[Solo]

[Chorus]
