Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Tailored suits, chauffeured cars
Fine hotels and big cigars
Up for grabs, all for a price
Where the red hot girls keep on dancing through the night

[Pre-Chorus]
The claim is on you, the sights are on me
So what do you do that's guaranteed?
Hey little girl, you want it all
The furs, the diamonds
The paintings on the wall

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk

[Verse 2]
A French maid, foreign chef
A big house, with king-size beds
You had enough, you ship them out
The dollar's up, down, you better buy the Pound




[Pre-Chorus]
The claim is on you, the sights are on me
So what do you do that's guaranteed?
Hey little girl, you break the laws
You hustle, you deal
You steal from us all

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1]
Money talks
Yeah-yow!

[Solo]

[Bridge 2]
Money talks
B.S. walks
Money talks
Come on, come on

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Money talks
Money talk, talk, talk
Oh, hear it talk
Yeah, yeah-yeah!
Moneytalk!
