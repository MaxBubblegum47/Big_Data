[Verse 1]
Some people say I'm only out at night
Maybe those folks might've got it right
And some people say I drive a Cadillac car
Or sell my wares haunting hotel bars

[Chorus]
I'm the boogie man
Yeah
The boogie man
Yeah, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
I like fine suits, smoke the best cigars
Like talking sex to women, girls, in fast cars
I might be under the bed, ready to bite
So, little girl, be careful when you're on your own, tonight
'Cause I'm your boogie man
Your boogie man

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hope that you don't misunderstand
Your boogie man

[Chorus]
I'm your boogie man
I'm the boogie man
Yes, I'm the boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Ow, here we go

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hope that you don't misunderstand
Your boogie man
And don't let the sun come up on me
Your boogie man

[Chorus]
I'm your boogie man, the boogie man
I'm your boogie man, the boogie man
I'm your boogie man, boogie man
Boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Yeah-yeah
I'm your boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Boogie man
