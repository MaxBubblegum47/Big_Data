[Verse 1]
All you women who want a man of the street
An' don't know which way you wanna turn
Just keep a-coming
And put your hand out to me
'Cause I'm the one who's going to make you burn

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going to take you down
Oh, down, down, down
So, don't you fool around
I'm gonna pull it, pull it
Pull the trigger

[Chorus]
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
Too many women with too many pills, yeah
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
I got my gun at the ready, gonna fire at will, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm like evil, I get under your skin
Just like a bomb that's ready to blow
'Cause I'm illegal
I got everything that all you women might need to know

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna take you down
Yeah, down, down, down
So, don't you fool around
I'm gonna pull it, pull it
Pull the trigger

[Chorus]
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
Too many women with too many pills, said
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
I got my gun at the ready, gonna fire at will
'Cause I shoot to thrill, and I'm ready to kill
I can't get enough and I can't get my fill
I shoot to thrill, play to kill
Yeah

[Bridge]
Pull the trigger, pull it
Pull it, pull it
Pull the trigger

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
Too many women with too many pills, I said
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
I got my gun at the ready, going to fire at will
'Cause I shoot to thrill and I'm ready to kill
I can't get enough and I can't get my fill
'Cause I shoot to thrill, play to kill

[Breakdown]
Yeah
Shoot you down, yeah
I'm gonna get you down on the bottom, girl
Shoot you, I'm going to shoot you
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I'm going to shoot you down, yeah-yeah
I'm going to get you down
Down, down, down, down
Shoot you, shoot you, shoot you, shoot you down
Shoot you, shoot you, shoot you down
I'm gonna shoot to thrill
Play to kill
Shoot to thrill
