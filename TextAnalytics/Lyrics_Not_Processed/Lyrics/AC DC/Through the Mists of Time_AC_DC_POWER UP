[Verse 1]
See dark shadows on the walls
See the pictures
Some hang, some fall
And the painted faces all in a line

[Pre-Chorus]
And the painted ladies
Yeah, the painted ladies

[Chorus]
Through the mists of time
The mists of time
All the restless cries
Through the mists of time
On a mountain high
Through the mists of time

[Verse 2]
Hear the whisper of the whirlwind
Monster shadows, a light gone dim
Dark horses roam in my sleep
Mystic voices conjure up our dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And the painted ladies
Yeah, the painted ladies

[Chorus]
Through the mists of time
The mists of time
All the restless cries
Through the mists of time
On a mountain high
Through the mists of time

[Solo]

[Bridge]
And the painted faces
Looking so divine

[Chorus]
Through the mists of time
The mists of time
All the restless cries
Through the mists of time
On a mountain high
Searchin' for a sign
Through the mists of time
The mists of time, time
