[Verse 1]
My daddy was a-working nine-to-five
When my momma was a-havin' me
By the time I was half-alive
They knew what I was going to be
But I left school and grew my hair
They didn't understand
They wanted me to be respected as a doctor or a lawyer man
(But I had other plans)

[Chorus]
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll
A rock 'n' roll star

[Verse 2]
Well, I worked real hard and bought myself
A rock 'n' roll guitar
I got to be on top someday
I wanna be a star
I can see my name in lights
And I can see the queue
I've got the devil in my blood
Telling me what to do
(And I'm all ears)

[Chorus]
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll
A rock 'n' roll star
I hear it pays well

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Well you can stick your nine-to-five livin'
And your collar and your tie
You can stick your moral standards
'Cause it's all a dirty lie
You can stick your golden handshake
And you can stick your silly rules
And all the other shit
That you teach to kids in school
'Cause I ain't no fool

[Chorus]
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll
A rock 'n' roll star

[Chorus]
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll
A rock 'n' roll star
Yes I are!
