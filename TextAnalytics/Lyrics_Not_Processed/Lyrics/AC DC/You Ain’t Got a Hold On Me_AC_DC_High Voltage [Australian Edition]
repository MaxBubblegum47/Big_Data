[Verse 1]
You can roll me 'round your finger
You can roll me if I'm blind
You can roll me, tally-ho-ho
I'm the easy rollin' kind
But don't think I'm facing down hill
Cause soon you'll see
You'll lose your grip and slip
'Cause you ain’t got a hold on me

[Chorus]
You ain’t got a hold on me
You ain’t got a hold on me
Why don't you let me be?
'Cause you ain’t got a hold on me

[Verse 2]
You can take me to your bedroom
You can take me to your heart
You can take me to a climax
I won't fall apart
But don't count on me giving it
All back to you
Just because I'm hooked on livin'
Doesn't mean I'm hooked on you

[Chorus]
Oh, let me be

[Solo]

[Chorus]
