[Verse 1]
"Freeze!" said the man cruising the beat
"You get your hands up, spread your feet"
"Don't you move an inch", I heard him say
"Or you'll be doin' time until the judgement day"

[Pre-Chorus]
And he said, "Don't tell me no lies, give me alibis
'Cause if you cross my path, you'll be doin' life"
It's a dirty lie

[Chorus]
It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
We got a shakedown
Another nervous shakedown
It's looking like a set-up

[Verse 2]
"Take a dime," said the man, "you can make one call"
"You got a one way ticket to the county hall"
Well the judge looked high and I looked low
When he smiled at me it was a one man show

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "2-to-5 the jury decides
Double parole, if you survive"
It's a dirty lie

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Lord they're gonna get you this time
And throw away the key

[Solo]
(Lock him up)

[Chorus]
It's a shakedown on...
You
Yes!
