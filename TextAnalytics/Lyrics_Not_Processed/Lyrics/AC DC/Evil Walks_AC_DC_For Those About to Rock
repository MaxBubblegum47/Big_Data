[Verse 1]
Black shadow hanging over your shoulder
Black mark up against your name
Your green eyes couldn't get any colder
There's bad poison running through your veins

[Chorus]
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you

[Verse 2]
Black widow weaving evil notions
Dark secrets being spun in your web
Good men going down in your ocean
They can't swim 'cause they're tied to your bed

[Chorus]
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you

[Bridge]
You just cry wolf
I sometimes wonder where you park your broom, ha ha
Oh, black widow

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Come on, weave your web
Down in your ocean
You got him tied to your bed
With your dark, dark secrets
And your green, green eyes
You black widow

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You're so bad
