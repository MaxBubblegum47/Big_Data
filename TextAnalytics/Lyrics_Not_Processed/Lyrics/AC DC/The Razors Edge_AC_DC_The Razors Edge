[Verse 1]
There's fighting on the left
And marching on the right
Don't look up in the sky
You're gonna die of fright

[Pre-Chorus]
Here comes the razor's edge

[Verse 2]
You're living on the edge
Don't know wrong from right
They're breathing down your neck
You're running out of lives

[Pre-Chorus]
And here comes the razor's edge
Here comes the razor's edge

[Chorus]
The razor's edge

[Bridge]
(Razor's edge)
To raise the dead
(Razor's edge)
To cut to shreds

To raise the dead

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Here comes the razor's edge
Here comes the razor's edge

[Bridge 2]
Well, here it comes
To cut to shreds
The razor's edge

[Chorus]
It's the razor's edge
On the razor's edge
That you'll be cut to shreds
Got a razor's edge
By the razor's edge
