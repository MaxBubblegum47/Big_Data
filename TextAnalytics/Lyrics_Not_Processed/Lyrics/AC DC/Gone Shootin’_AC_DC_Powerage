[Verse 1]
Feel the pressure rise
Hear the whistle blow
Bought a ticket of her own accord
To, I donâ€™t know
Packed her heart in a travellin' bag
And never said, "bye-bye"
Something missin' in the neighborhood
Of her cryin' eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I stirred my coffee with the same spoon
Knew her favorite tune

[Chorus]
Gone shootin'
My baby gone shootin'

[Verse 2]
Wrapped herself around
Like a second skin
Backed her favorite nag
But she could never win
I took an offer in another town
She took another pill
She was runnin' in an overdrive
A victim of overkill

[Pre-Chorus]
She never made it past the bedroom door
What was she aiming for?

[Chorus]
Gone shootin'
She's gone
Gone, gone, gone

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Gone shootin'
My baby's gone shootin'
Look out, woo
(Gone shootin') How am I gonna get her down?
(Gone shootin') Ow, look out, look out, look out
(Gone shootin') I shouldn't get in her way
(Gone shootin') Ah, she sure is loaded
(Gone shootin') She's gone, gone, gone, gone, she's gone
(Gone shootin')

I used to love her so
