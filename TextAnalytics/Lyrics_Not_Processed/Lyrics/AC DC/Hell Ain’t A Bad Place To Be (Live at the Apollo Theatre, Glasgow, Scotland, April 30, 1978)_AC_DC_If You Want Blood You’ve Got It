Hey you
Yeah you

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes, not
Puts me down, fool me around
Why she do it to me?
Out for satisfaction, any piece of action
That ain't the way it should be

[Pre-Chorus]
She needs lovin'
Knows I'm the man
She's gotta see
Pours my beer
Licks my ear
Brings out the devil in me

[Chorus]
Hell ain't a bad place to be

[Verse 2]
Spends my money, drinks my booze
Stays out every night
But I got to thinking, "Hey, just a minute
Something ain't right"
Disillusions and confusion
Make me wanna cry
All the same, you playin' your games
Tellin' me those lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't mind her playing demon
As long as it's with me
If this is hell, then let me say
It's heavenly

[Chorus]
Hell ain't a bad place to be

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Then, the other night
Turns down the light
Closes up on me
Opens my heart
Tears it apart
Brings out the devil in me

[Chorus]
Hell ain't a bad place to be
I said, hell ain't a bad place to be
Hell ain't a bad place to be
You know, that hell ain't a bad place to be
