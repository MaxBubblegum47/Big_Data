[Verse 1]
I like to slip into something good
I see a young girl in the neighborhood
The way she move, I must confess
I'd like to run my hands up and down her legs
The way she dress, she look so fine
I'll make her wet, gonna make her mine
She like it hard, she don't like it slow
Alright, honey
Come on, let's go

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, feel what you want
It's the way she move
Baby, feel what you need
So, come on, let's go

[Chorus]
Cover you in oil
Let me cover you in oil
I want to cover you in oil
Let me cover you in oil, yeah

[Verse 2]
Pull on the zip, she give good lip (service)
It's nothing for the show, I just pay to see her go
She make you hot, you spray your lot
So, come on in, honey, we're heading to the top
The way she push, she don't give a dime
Abuse your life, gonna make you satisfied
She's kinda rough, she give it tough
Come on, honey, strut your stuff

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, feel what you want
It's the way she move
Baby, feel what you need
So, come on, let's go

[Chorus]
Cover you in oil
Let me cover you in oil
I want to cover you in oil
Let me cover you in oil, yeah

Let's go
Ooh, yeah

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Baby, what you want
It's the way she moves
Feel what you need
So, come on, let's go

[Chorus]
Cover you in oil
Let me cover you in oil
I want to cover you in oil
Let me cover you in oil, yeah

[Chorus]
Cover you in oil
Let me cover you in oil
I want to cover you in oil
Let me cover you in oil, yeah

Cover you
In oil
