[Verse 1]
Want some relaxation
Need to get some R'N'R
(That's rest and recreation)
Don't need no vacation
I don't have to go that far
(I've got better things to do with my money)

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't need no private eye
Forget the F.B.I
'Cause when the beaver sings
You know I'm closing in, yeah

[Chorus]
To the go zone
Ready to fly in the go zone
Standin' up high in the go zone
Down on the block in the go zone
Ready to rock
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down in the go zone

[Verse 2]
Gotta have my candy
Gotta have my sugar sweet
(I wanna give you a treat)
Givin' you directions
You don't have to use your feet
(Why, we're on the same street, baby)

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got to travel south
South of my hungry mouth
And there you'll find a friend
Until the bitter end

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ooh yeah
What you gonna find down there?
Ain't no red light to stop you

[Solo]

Get yourself a ticket

[Chorus]

In the go zone
Leave me to die in the go zone
Standing up high in the go zone
Down on the block
Go zone
Ready to rock
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
In the go zone
