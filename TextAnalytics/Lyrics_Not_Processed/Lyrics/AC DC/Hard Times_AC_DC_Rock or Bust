[Verse 1]
Feel her low
Goin' down slow
Make it quake
And make her body shake

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryin' to hold you down
They can't push you 'round
TheyÂ´ll try to hold you back
Gettin' on the right track

[Chorus]
Hard times, blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Run, run, make it fun
Freein' up the time

[Verse 2]
Heart a-pumping, feet are jumpin'
This hard loving keeps me running

[Pre-Chorus]
They try to hold him down
But they can't push you 'round
Tryin' to hold you back
Gettin' on the right track

[Chorus]
Hard times, blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Run, run, make it fun
Freein' up the time
Hard time, get on time
Throw me down the line
Hard times, get on line
Make a grown man blind

[Bridge]
Hard times
These hard times sure ain't been good to me
Hard times, hard times
Sure been misery

[Chorus]
Hard times, blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Run, run make it fun
Freein' up the time
Hard times, get on time
Throw me down the line
Hard times, get on line
Make a grown man blind
