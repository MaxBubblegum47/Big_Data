[Verse 1]
Well me and the boys
Are out to have some fun
Gonna put on a show
Come on, let's go

[Chorus]
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight

[Verse 2]
Every night, there's a rock 'n' roll queen
Gonna quiver and quake
Gonna shake her thing

[Chorus]
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
It's a rock 'n' roll show

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
We got a big fat sound
Wanna share it round
Got a big bass drum
Gonna have some fun

[Chorus]
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight

[Solo]
Does that rock, or what?

[Chorus]
