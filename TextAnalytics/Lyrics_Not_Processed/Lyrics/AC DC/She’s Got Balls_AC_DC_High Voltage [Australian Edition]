[Verse 1]
She's got style, that woman
Makes me smile, that woman
She's got spunk, that woman
Funk, that woman
She's got speed, my lady
Got what I need, my baby
She's got the ability, hey
To make a man out of me

[Pre-Chorus]
But most important of all
Let me tell you

[Chorus]
The lady's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls

[Verse 2]
She's got soul, my lady
Likes to crawl, my baby
All around the floor on her hands and knees
Ooh, because she likes to please me

[Pre-Chorus]
But most important of all
Let me tell you

[Chorus]
The lady's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
And she's got taste, my lady
Pace, my lady
Makes my heart race
With her pretty face
She's got balls, my lady
Likes to crawl, my lady
Hands and knees all around the floor
No one has to tell her what a feller is for

[Pre-Chorus]
But let me tell you all

[Chorus]
The lady's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls

[Chorus]
The lady's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
She's got balls
