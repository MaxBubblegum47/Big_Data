[Verse 1]
Riot on the radio
Pictures on the TV
Invader man take what he can
Shootout on the silver screen
Sticking 'em up and knocking 'em down
Living out a fantasy
There's a bad man cruisin' around
In a big black limousine

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let it be wrong
Don't let it be right
Get in his way
You're dead in his sights

[Chorus]
Big gun
Big gun, number one
Big gun
Big gun kick the hell out of you

[Verse 2]
Terminators, Uzi makers
Shooting up Hollywood
Snakes alive with a .45
Gettin' up and doin' no good
If you ain't wise, they'll cannibalize
Tear the flesh off you
Classified lady killers
Playing in the human zoo

[Pre-Chorus]
He saddle you up
And take you to town
Better look out
When he come around

[Chorus]

Showdown, yeah

[Solo]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Mmm-hmm
Uh-huh
Yeah-yeah
Mmm
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

[Chorus]
Big gun, got a hot one
Big gun, got a number one
Big gun, loaded and cocked
Big gun, yeah, hot, hot, hot
Got big gun, ready or not
Big gun, give it a, give it a shot, come on
Terminator, Uzi makers
A regulator, yeah, gonna get you later

Big gun kick the hell out of you
