[Verse 1]
I can tell by the look in your eye
I can tell by the way you sigh
That you know I've been thinkin' of you
And you know what I want to do

[Chorus]
Oh, Jean
Oh, Jean
Oh, Jean
Oh, Jean

[Verse 2]
When you smile, I see stars in the sky
When you smile, I see sunrise
And I know you've been thinkin' of me
And I know how you want it to be

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
I can tell by the things you say
I can tell that you know the way
And I know what you want me to do
Oh, I've got hearts and flowers for you

If you leave me, you'll make me cry
When I think of you saying goodbye
Oh the sky turns a, a deeper blue
That's - that's how I'd feel if I lost you

[Chorus]
