[Verse 1]
Don't you gimme no line
Better run, if you can
Just like a thorn in the side

[Pre-Chorus]
So, don't gimme no
Don't you gimme no
Don't you gimme no
Don't you gimme no lies

[Chorus]
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll

[Verse 2]
Don't you play me no jive
A bit of fun on the side
Can too much crap make you blind

[Pre-Chorus]
So, don't gimme no
Don't you gimme no
Don't you gimme no
Don't you gimme no whine

[Chorus] (x2)

[Bridge]
I said
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Solo]

[Chorus] (x2)

[Bridge]
Listen, everybody
Said
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
I said, you can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
