[Verse 1]
Well there's a love goin' down on mine
Suicidal voltage line
She sends signals out, of distress
She devil, she evil
She got you reelin' on a rockin' machine

[Chorus]
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch, she'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch, she can satisfy

[Verse 2]
She gonna blow you all sky high
Flush the eye, electrify
A power force you should feel
She devil, she evil
She get you screamin' on a lightnin' machine

[Chorus]
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch, she'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch, she can satisfy
Give you pain, blow your brain

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Flick the switch, flick the switch
With a flick of the switch, she'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch, she can satisfy
With a flick of the switch, yeah, gonna burn you down
With a flick of the switch, razed to the ground
With a flick of the switch (x2)
With a flick of the switch, she gonna give you pain
With a flick of the switch, she gonna blow your brain
Blow your brain
She gonna put the light out on you
