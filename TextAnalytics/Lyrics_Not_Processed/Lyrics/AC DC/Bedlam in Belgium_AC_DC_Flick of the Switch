[Verse 1]
The blood in my veins
Was running right through my brain
There was a cop with a gun
Who was running around insane

[Pre-Chorus]
Three-fifty arrests
No bulletproof vest
Now ain't that a shame?
We wanted to play
Play for the crowd
Law said, "No way, 'cause you're on your way out"

[Chorus]
Bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium

[Verse 2]
The place was a-jumpin'
And the booze was goin' down
There's a curfew in town
You'll be working overtime

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't play just for pay
So we'd like to stay
Stay just the same
He gave me a crack in the back with his gun
Hurt me so bad I could feel the blood run

[Chorus]
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium, yeah

[Bridge]
Who's to blame?
It's a shame

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Bedlam
In Belgium
It was bedlam
Yeah

Get it ready

[Bridge]
Stayed on the stage, cops in a rage
Crowd yelled for more, it was war, war, war

[Chorus]
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium

It was bedlam (in Belgium)
It was bedlam (in Belgium)
It was bedlam
And the law got the drop on
Me
