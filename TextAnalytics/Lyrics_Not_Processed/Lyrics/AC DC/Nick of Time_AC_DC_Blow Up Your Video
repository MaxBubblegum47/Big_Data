[Verse 1]
Wrong track, wrong line
This train never run on time
Bad blood, bad news
Long rope, got nothing to lose
Mad bull seein' red
Coming at me, happy when I'm dead
Jump a fence, get away
Ain't got a liking for the games he plays
What you gonna do?

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody tryin' to find you guilty
Make you wanna toe the line
Saved by...

[Chorus]
Saved in the nick of time
I was saved in the nick of time

[Verse 2]
Slow plane, hard rain
Cold sweat and I feel the strain
Look down, no ground
Black sky, just the engine sound
Bail out, goodbye
Take my chances, I don't want to die
Count ten, just pray
The nick of time will save me any day
What you gonna do?

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody love a hero, honey
Living on the danger line
Saved by...

[Chorus]
Saved in the nick of time
Yeah, saved in the nick of time

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Lose sleep, get grief
Sunday, gettin' no relief
Quick punch, closed eye
You didn't do it, you wonder why
Lynch mob on your tail
Think they were searching for the holy grail
Leave town, get away
I didn't figure on them anyway
No I didn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody trying to find you guilty
Make you wanna toe the line
Saved by...

[Chorus]
Saved in the nick of time
Oh yeah
On the nick of time
In the nick of time
I was saved - in - the - nick - of - time
