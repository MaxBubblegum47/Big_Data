[Verse 1]
Wild beast, I'll make you mine
Taste your kiss, sweet lips divine
She got moves, drips of sweat
She got eyes of blue, body curves
And legs that'll break your nerves

[Pre-Chorus]
(Fire) - When she's going down
(Fire) - Then she make you drown
(Fire) - Then she blow you 'round
Yeah
You want some fun?

[Chorus]
Fire your guns
Fire your guns
Fire your guns
Fire your guns

[Verse 2]
That lady bites, hard style
Drips of sex, eyes are wild
She got moves, long long legs
She got eyes of blue, body curves
Legs that'll shake the earth

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Solo]
