[Verse 1]
Well, there'll be no words of fighting, around here
'Cause nothing don't matter, 'cause it ain’t clear
Well, it could be on a Monday
Or it could be even a Sunday
So, if you can't stand the distance, you better disappear
Do I make myself clear?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm ready to rock, I'm going to rip it
Ready to rock, yeah, I'm going to stick it

[Chorus]
Give it up, give it out
Whip it up, all about
Stick it up, shout it loud
Come on
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up

[Verse 2]
Well, there's a big storm a-howlin', around here
And there be no wine, no cinnamon and no beer
I'm gonna aim to fire a rocket
There ain’t no damn way to stop it
I got a sure-fire bullet
To get you outta here
I said, do I make myself clear?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm goin' crazy on a wild man night
Take your pick of anything you like
Give it up
Give it up
Sitting pretty, all ready to bite
She givin' up a bit of cream delight

[Chorus]
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
You gotta give it up, give it out
Whip it up, all about
You gotta stick it up, shout it loud
Give it up, all around (give it up)
Give it up, give it up, give it up (givin' it up)
Whippin' it in, whippin' it out (givin' it up)
Stick it up, stick it up, stick it out (givin' it up)
Give it up, all around
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Givin' it up, stickin' it out
Givin' it up, givin' it up
Give it up
Do I make myself clear?
