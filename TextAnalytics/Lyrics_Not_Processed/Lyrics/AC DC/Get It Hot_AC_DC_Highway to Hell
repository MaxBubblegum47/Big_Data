[Verse 1]
Going out on the town
Just a me and you
Going to have ourselves a party
Just like we used to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody's playing Manilow
Nobody's playing soul
And no one's playing hard to get
Just a good old rock 'n' roll

[Chorus]
Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby, get it hot
Get it hot, get it hot
Alright

[Verse 2]
Movin' 'round the motorway
Got a whole lotta booze
Got myself a sweet little number
Who's got nothing to lose
(Ha-ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna bend you like a G string
Conduct you like a choir
So get your body in the right place
We'll set the world on fire

[Chorus]
Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby, get it hot
Get it hot, get it hot
Alright

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby, get it hot
Get it hot
Oh, get it hot
All you can get
Get it hot
Come on baby, get it hot
Make me feel good, get it hot
Oh, baby
Get it hot
Right now
