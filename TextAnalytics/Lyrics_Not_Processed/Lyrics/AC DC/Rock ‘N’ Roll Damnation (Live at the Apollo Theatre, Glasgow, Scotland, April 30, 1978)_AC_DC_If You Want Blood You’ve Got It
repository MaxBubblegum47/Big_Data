[Verse 1]
They say that you play too loud
Well, baby, that's tough
They say that you've got too much
Can't get enough
They tell you that you look a fool
Or maybe I'm a fool for you
State that you're my disease
Shake your stuff

[Chorus]
And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whipping boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance, while you still got the choice

[Verse 2]
You say that you want respect
Honey, for what?
For everything that you done for me
Well, uh, thanks a lot
Come on
Get up off your bended knees
You can set your mind at ease
My temperature's runnin' hot
Oh, I been waiting all night for a bite of what you got

[Chorus]
And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whipping boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance, while you still got the choice

[Bridge]
Oh, it's a hard life
(Damnation) They're putting you down
(Damnation) All over town
(Damnation) 'Cause you're way out of reach
Livin' on the street, you got to practice what you preach

[Chorus ]
And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whipping boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance, while you still got the choice

[Outro]
(Damnation) You left a happy home
(Damnation) To live on your own
(Damnation) You want to live in sin
(Damnation) It's a rock 'n' roll (damnation)
Just a bundle of joy
(Damnation) You're a toy for a boy
(Damnation) You got dollars in your eyes
(Damnation) Always chasing the pie in the sky
(Damnation)
Rock 'n' roll (damnation)
