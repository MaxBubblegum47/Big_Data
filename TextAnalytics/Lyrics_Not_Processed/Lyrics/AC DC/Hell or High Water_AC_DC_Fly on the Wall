Get out my way
D'you hear what I say?

[Verse 1]
Everybody, you don't have to choose
You don't have to prove
It's only rock 'n' roll

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama done told me
Papa done scold me

[Verse 2]
Superstition, black cat in the cradle
Dancing on the table
Don't you sing on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama done told me
Daddy done scold me
Told me, shown me
You know that he showed me

[Chorus]
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water
Come Hell or high water

[Verse 3]
Blood money, lying through your back teeth
Fighting on the main street
Breathe your last breath on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama done told me
"Poor boy, get home"

[Verse 4]
Hot living, trigger-happy feeling
Touch him up and tease him
You know it's so bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama done told me
Papa done scold me
Told me, shown me
Rock 'n' rolled me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Come Hell
Hell, Hell, Hell
Give it Hell

[Solo]

[Chorus] (x3)
