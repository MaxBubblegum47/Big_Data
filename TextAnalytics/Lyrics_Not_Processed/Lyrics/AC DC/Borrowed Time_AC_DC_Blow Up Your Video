[Verse 1]
Got the word, getting ready
Gonna get my pay from union man
On a lake, boatin' heavy
Where the action is hot, is where I am
No town, no city
Gonna be free from the jumping jack
Kiss of life, getting gritty
If the mule don't kick, you know the mule don't ride

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, yes I know, woah I know
That's the way to go
And I know, and I know, ooh
I know I'm gonna, gettin' down the road

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm livin' on borrowed time
You do it your way, I'll do it mine
Living on borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign
No sign

[Verse 2]
Call me names, call me crazy
Don't try to stop me when I feel this way
It's a game, whoopsy-daisy
Here come another girl to make my day

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, yes I know, an' I know
That's the way it go
And I know, yes I know
I'm gonna get a bone when I'm on the road

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm living on borrowed time
You do it your way, I'll do it mine
'Cause I'm living on borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign

[Bridge]
So long
Goodbye
Good luck
Au revoir, baby

[Solo]
Look out people
Nothin' left to lose, 'cause I'm

[Chorus]
Living on borrowed time
You do it your way, I'll do it mine
Living on borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign
Yes, I'm living on borrowed time
Living on borrowed time
I'm living on borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign, no sign
I don't need a sign to show me the way
