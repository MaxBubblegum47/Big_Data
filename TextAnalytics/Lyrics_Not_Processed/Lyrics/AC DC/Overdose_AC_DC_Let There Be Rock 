[Verse 1]
I never smoked me no cigarettes
I never drank much booze
But I'm only a man, don't you understand?
And a man can sometime lose
You gave me somethin' I never had
Pulled me down with you
Hit me up, big hunk of love
Hope you can pull me through

[Chorus]
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy, but it's true
Ain't nothing I can do
I overdosed on you

[Verse 2]
Oh, woman, you give to me
More than I can take
But listen, honey
I don't mind
You're a habit I don't wanna break
Don't want me none of that harder stuff
Don't need it anymore
I'm in hell and I'm sinking fast
And I don't need no cure

[Chorus]
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy, but it's true
Ain't nothing I can do
I overdosed on you

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Then I was happy as a man (can) be
Too far gone to save
Died of love
And plenty of
Just write on my grave...

[Chorus]
"I overdosed on you"
I overdosed on you
Crazy, but it's true
But nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you

[Outro]
On you
On you
On you
All over you
All over you
All over
I overdosed
Overdosed
Overdosed, on you
Overdosed
