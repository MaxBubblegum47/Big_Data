[Verse 1]
A rolling rock, electric shocks
She gives a lickin' that don't stop
She light 'em up, push you 'round
Smokin' rings goin' 'round and 'round

[Pre-Chorus]
Her hot potatoes
Will elevate you
Her bad behavior
Will leave you standin' proud
An' hard as a rock

[Chorus]
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock

[Verse 2]
The lightnin' rod strike it hot
It's gonna hit you like the Rushmore rock
No nicotine and no pipe dreams
So low and dirty, it's down right mean

[Pre-Chorus]
Hell elevator
Yeah, I'll see you later
No, I ain't going to take it
Yes, I'm
I'm busting out
I'm hard as a rock

[Chorus]
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock

[Bridge 1]
Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yeah
I'm gettin' harder

[Solo]
Harder than a rock

[Bridge 2]
Well, I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Babe, I'm harder than a rock, yeah

[Chorus]
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
