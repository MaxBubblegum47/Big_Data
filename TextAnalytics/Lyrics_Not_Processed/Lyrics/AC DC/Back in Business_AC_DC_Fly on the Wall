[Verse 1]
Breaking out, about to shout
Feel a need for one more round
Don't you struggle, don't try to bite
If you want some trouble, I'm the king of vice
I'm a wrecking ball, I'm a stinging knife
Steal your money, gonna take your life

[Pre-Chorus]
You got screaming murder, lock up your door
Double dealing, got to have more
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell the boys that I'm gonna be

[Chorus]
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business

[Verse 2]
Flesh and blood, I'm a rag and bone
A bad luck message on the telephone
Don't you worry, play my game
I'll do you a favor, put your soul for sale
Like a cannonball, goin' down the track
Need good lovin', but I want it back

[Pre-Chorus]
I was found in trouble, they gave up on me
Teacher preaching what not to be
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell my boys that I'm gonna be

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus] (x2)
You feel the burn?

[Chorus]
(Back in business) You read the small print in this contract?
(Back in business) Yeah, I'm the man with a shaft
(Back in business) An' I'm gonna stick it right up ya
(Back in business) I got you on mine
Back in business again (and I'm gonna win)
