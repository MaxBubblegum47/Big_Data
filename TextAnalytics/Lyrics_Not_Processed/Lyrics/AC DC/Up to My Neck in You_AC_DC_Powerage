[Verse 1]
Well I been up to my neck in trouble
Up to my neck in strife
Up to my neck in misery
For most of my life
I been a fool
And you know what a fool can do
I'm telling you

[Chorus]
You come along when I needed you
Now I'm up
I'm up to my neck in you

[Verse 2]
And I been up to my neck in pleasure
Up to my neck in pain
I been up to my neck on the railroad track
Waitin' for the train
To cruise on through
I figured my time was due
Oh, it's way overdue

[Chorus]
You come along and you pulled me through
Now I'm up
Up
Up to my neck in you
Don't it feel good?

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I been up to my neck in whiskey
I been up to my neck in wine
I been up to my neck in wishin'
That this neck wasn't mine
Oh, I'm a loser
(Who ainâ€™t lost it)
Baby, you were too good
Too good to be true

[Chorus]
What you've done, no one else could do
Now I'm up
Oh, I'm up to my neck in you
Oh, that feels good
Yeah, you come along when I needed you
Oh
I'm up to my neck in you
