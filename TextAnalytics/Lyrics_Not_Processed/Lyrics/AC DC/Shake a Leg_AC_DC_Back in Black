[Verse 1]
Idle juvenile on the street, on the street
Ooh, he's kickin' everything with his feet, with his feet
Fightin' on the wrong side of the law, of the law, yeah

[Break]
Don't kick, don't fight, don't sleep at night
And shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake it up, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Keepin' out of trouble, with eyes in the back of my face
Kickin' ass in the class and they tell me I'm a damn disgrace
They tell me what they think, but they stink and I really don't care
Got a mind of my own, move on, get out of my hair

[Chorus]
Oh, shake a leg, shake your head
Shake a leg, wake the dead
Shake a leg, get stuck in
Shake a leg
Shake a leg, yow

[Verse 3]
Magazines, wet dreams, 
dirty women on machines
 for me
Big licks, skin flicks, tricky dicks are my chemistry
Goin' against the grain, tryin' to keep me sane with you
So, stop your grinnin', and 
drop your linen for me

[Chorus]
Oh, shake a leg, shake your head
Shake a leg, wake the dead
Shake a leg, get stuck in
Shake a leg
Shake a leg, yeah
Shake it!
Come on!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Idle juvenile on the street, on the street
Kickin' everything with his feet, with his feet, yeah
Fightin' on the wrong side of the law, of the law, yeah
Spittin' and bitin' and kickin' and fightin' for more
Shake a leg, shake your head
Shake a leg, wake the dead
Shake a leg, get stuck in
Shake a leg, play to win
Shake a leg, shut your hand
Shake a leg, wake the dead
Shake a leg, get stuck in
Shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake it, ow!
