[Verse 1]
Feeling the rock n' roll mood
Gonna make you feel good
Might be a little dangerous
I believe, I believe
You will see, it could be
Contagious

[Chorus]
Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, try the money shot
Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, just try the money shot
(Best taken when hot)

[Verse 2]
I got a good prescription
For the state of your condition
You gotta take it three times a day
Or as much, or as much as you may
That's my diagnosis

[Chorus]
Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, try the money shot
Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, try the money shot

[Bridge]
Try the money shot
Hey

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now, take this down
Gonna send you on your way
'Cause I bеlieve I've solvеd your case
I'll give you your relief

[Chorus]
Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, try the money shot
Doctor, what's the antidote?
Lady, try the money shot
We got a good cure for what ails ya
It won't fail ya
Try the money shot
Doctor, show me the antidote
I'd try the money shot
I'd try the money shot
