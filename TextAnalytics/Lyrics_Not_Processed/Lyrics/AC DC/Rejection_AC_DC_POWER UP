[Verse 1]
You better give me what I want
Or I'll beat on you
You don't give me what I need
And I'll come for you
Better keep me on your side, or I'll find you in the night
I got your name and your number and I'll set you all ablaze
Best give me what I want

[Pre-Chorus]
Or I'll come for you
Yes, I'll come for you

[Chorus]
If you reject me, I'll take what I want
Disrespect me, and you get burned
Best keep me satisfied, or you know I'll eat you alive
If you reject me, I'll take what I want

[Verse 2]
I got a ball and chain
And I'll hunt for you
I ain't got no name
I'll look out for you
Revenge it ain't a sin
Look out, I'm comin' in
Kick me when I'm down, stand up without a sound
Better play my game

[Pre-Chorus]
Or I'll beat on you
Get to feed on you

[Chorus]
If you reject me, I'll take what I want
Take what I want
Disrespect me, and you get burned
Now, I don't want your money, agreed
You better give me just what I need
If you reject me
I'll take what I want
Hey, hey, take what I want

[Solo]

[Chorus]
If you reject me, I'll take what I want
Disrespect me, and you get burned
Now, I don't want your money, agreed
You better give me just what I need
If you reject me
I'll take what I want
Hey, hey, take what I want
Take what I want
Take what I want
