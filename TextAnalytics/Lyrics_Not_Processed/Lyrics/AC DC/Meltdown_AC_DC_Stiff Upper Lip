[Verse 1]
I look at my watch to find out
The right time of day
I look at her libido
Hey, hey, hey
I'm gonna get off and come home
And roll her on the hay
Making her sweat, temperature rise
All through the day

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, it's getting hot, hot, hot
I said, man, it's getting hot, hot, hot
It's getting hotter
And hotter
Man, it's getting hot, hot
Gettin' hot around here

[Chorus]
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown

[Verse 2]
I got a feelin' in my bones
I've been racking my brains out
All night long
Stokin' up the fire
Take it right up to the wire
Burning on and on
Burning on

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] (x2)
