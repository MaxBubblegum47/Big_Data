[Verse 1]
Well, you ask me 'bout the clothes I wear
And you ask me why I grow my hair
And you ask me why I'm in a band
I dig doing one night stands
And you want to see me doin my thing
All you got to do is plug me in to

[Pre-Chorus]
High
I said high

[Chorus]
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll

[Verse 2]
Well, you ask me why I like to dance
And you ask me why I like to sing
And you ask me why I like to play
I got to get my kicks some way
And you ask me what I'm all about
Come on, let me hear you shout

[Pre-Chorus]
"High"
I said, "High"

[Chorus]
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I said high
I said high

[Chorus]
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll

[Outro]
Stars, bulbs
All around the spotlight
Put the lights out, turn me on
(High voltage rock 'n' roll)
(High voltage rock 'n' roll)
Wine, women and song
(High voltage, high voltage)
Plugged in and turned on, it's sparkin' and
(High voltage rock 'n' roll)
