[Chorus 1]
Old man's car on a Saturday night
Got me a woman, me I feel alright
Rock and rolling at the drive-in show
Going to sit in the back in the passion row
Turn up the soundtrack, turn down the lights
Chance she won't but there is a chance she might
There is no woman in the world I know
That hasn't had her knickers on the automobile floor

[Chorus 2]
What's that [?] sound
Things going down
Look at what is going round
Back seat confidential

[Verse]
Said to buy a rubber by the cigarette stand
Dying to get it off so that I can get in
Doing my best to make a good connection
She say what you gonna do about my protection?
All right mama, got to listen to me
Last chance thrill it is half past three
Hugging and kissing will be real nice
Every man's got his price

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Around
Back seat confidential
