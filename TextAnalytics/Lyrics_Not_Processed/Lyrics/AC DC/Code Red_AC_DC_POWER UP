[Verse 1]
Loading up the battery, raising up insanity
Beating out the old-time blues
Crawling up the walls
Sleeping on a waterfall

Belting out that tune
Strike one, strike two
Set your guns ablaze
Strike three, call emergency

You're gonna play it safe
Speeding up the road
Tearing up the highway code
Ain’t gonna slow me down

No need to hesitate
Ain't comin' up late
And hit the brakes
Don’t mess with fate

[Pre-Chorus]
Hot fight, a rough night
Dead in your sight
Fire light, a fire bright
Fire in the night

[Chorus]
Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Ooh, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red

[Verse 2]
Now pay attention
Reputation on your mind
Enemy within your sight
Fire up, fire straight, fire free
Situation on your mind, in the pale moon light
Run quick, run silent, run deep

[Pre-Chorus]
Hot fight, a rough night
Dead in your sight
Fire light, a fire bright
Fire in the night

[Chorus]
Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Code, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Code, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red

Hey, code red
Code red
Hey
