[Verse 1]
I met her in Caroline
Round about sixty-nine
Well she came up to me and said, Hi there honey
How would you like to come along

[Chorus]
Because we are going to have a party
Yeah a rock and roll party
Well we are going to have a party
And before I knew
We were rocking in the parlour
Rocking in the parlour

[Verse 2]
Well the next time I saw her roll
Was way down in Mexico
She said, I have got some booze around at my place
So come along and have some fun

[Chorus]
