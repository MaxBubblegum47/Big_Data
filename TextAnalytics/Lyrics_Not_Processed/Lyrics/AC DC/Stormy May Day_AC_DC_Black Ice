[Verse 1]
The storm is raging
Winds are howling
No one is calling to rescue you
A flash of lightning
Our times are frightening
A rain is coming
And the sun don't shine

[Chorus]
Rain day
Mayday
Mayday
Stormy rain day
Rain day
Mayday
Mayday
Stormy rain day
Stormy may day

[Verse 2]
The sky is darkening
The dogs are barking
A call for help
You hope they get you through
A clap of thunder
A split asunder
The people running
And the moon don't rise

[Chorus]
Rain day
Mayday
Mayday
Stormy may day

[Outro]
Rain day
Mayday
Mayday
Stormy rain day
Stormy may day
