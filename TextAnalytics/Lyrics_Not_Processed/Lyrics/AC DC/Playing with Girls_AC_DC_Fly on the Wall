[Verse 1]
Highball women that are hot to touch
Legs do the talking, spelling out, "lust"
See the sugar daddies with a sweet tooth and a smile
See what's hanging off him like an orphaned child

[Pre-Chorus]
That's where you'll find me, standing proud

[Chorus 1]
Playing with girls gonna get you hot
Playing with guns gonna get you shot
Playing with fire gonna heat you up
Playing with me, you're gonna get the lot

[Verse 2]
Bring on the showgirls and the debutantes
Late-night waitress in a restaurant
Heading for the clubs and bars with the flashing lights
Looking for the good-time girls in their black nylon tights

[Pre-Chorus]
Over the barrel, bottoms-up

[Chorus 1]
Playing with girls gonna get you hot
Playing with guns gonna get you shot
Playing with fire gonna heat you up
Playing with me, you're gonna get the lot

[Bridge]
Ooh, river run dry
Yeah-yeah, you're only playing with fire
Ooh, wild sweet child
Playing with girls
Playing with girls

[Solo]

Playin'
Playin'
Playin' with girls
Playin' with girls

[Verse 3]
Bring on the tall girls, but I'll take 'em small
I want 'em all up front, I like 'em all
I want to see you strut your stuff
Lose your social grace
You play your cards right and you'll deal yourself an ace

[Pre-Chorus]
That's where you'll find me standing proud

[Outro]
Playin' with girls
Playin' with girls
Playin' with girls
Playin' with girls
Like a long girl, short girl
Nothin' like a bad girl
Lover girl
Just playin' with a girl

I want all the women in the world
