[Verse 1]
Well it's a dog eat dog
Eat cat, too
Frenchy eat frog
An' I eat you
Business man, when you make a deal
Do you know who you can trust?
Do you sign your life away?
Do you write your name in dust?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day

[Chorus]
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

[Verse 2]
Dog eat dog
Read the news
Someone win
Someone lose
Up's above and down's below
And limbo's in between
Up, you win
Down, you lose
It's anybody's game

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day

[Chorus]
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Woof!

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
And it's a eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
It's a lie; that's the truth
See the blind man on the street
Lookin' for something free
Hear the kind man ask his friend
"Hey, what's in it for me?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day

[Chorus]
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
