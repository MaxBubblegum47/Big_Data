[Verse 1]
On the day I was born, the rain fell down
There was trouble brewin' in my home town
It was the seventh day, I was the seventh son
And it scared the hell out of everyone

[Chorus]
They said, "stop"
I said, "go"
They said, "fast"
I said, "slow"
They said, "yes"
I said, "no"
I do the bad boy boogie

[Verse 2]
Being a bad boy ain't that bad
I had me more dirty women than most men ever had
All you women, come along with me
And I'll show how good a bad boy can be

[Chorus]
I said, "right"
And they said, "left"
I said, "east"
And they said, "west"
I said, "up"
And they said, "down"
I do the bad boy boogie
All over town

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
I wouldn't tell you no story
Tell you no lie
I was born to love 'till the day I die
I just line 'em up
And I knock them down
And they all came a running when the word got around
(Just keep runnin')

[Chorus]
(Bad boy boogie) I said, "up"
They said, "down"
(Bad boy boogie) They said, "straight"
I said, "round"
(Bad boy boogie) They said, "lost"
I said, "found"
(Bad boy boogie) I said, "free"
They said, "bound"
Bad boy boogie
Do the bad boy boogie
Bad boy boogie
Bad boy boogie
