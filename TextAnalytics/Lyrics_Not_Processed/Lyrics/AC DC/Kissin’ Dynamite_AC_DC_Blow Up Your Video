[Verse 1]
Here she come, here she come
Eatin' up the thrill
Sugar cane, sugar cane
Dressin' up to kill

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a fireball in the shadow
Like a storm that's gonna show
Like an overwound volcano
Gettin' set to blow, set to blow
She got a nasty reputation
She got a healthy appetite
When she needs some detonation
She set the fuse alight, the fuse alight

[Chorus]
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Woah, I feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite

[Verse 2]
Let it rain, let it rain
Let me feel it pour
Let it slide, let it slide
Let me feel the core

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a thunder in the mountain
Like the lightning in the sky
Like the eye of a wild tornado
She watch it all go by, all go by
Then she kill for recreation
And she play her games at night
She want to work on her vocation
She set the world alight, set the world alight

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Dynamite), here it come
(Dynamite), gonna blow
(Dynamite), just pourin' on you
(Dynamite), like a volcano
(Dynamite), she got an imagination on recreation, alright
(Dynamite), that's where you want it, that's the way he'll go
(Dynamite)

[Chorus]
