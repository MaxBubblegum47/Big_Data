The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing
But I can weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm?

I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah, I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah, I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah ah ah ah ah

I need, got my love to keep me warm
I can't remember a worse December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form?

I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah, I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah, I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah ah ah ah ah

I need, I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah, I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah, I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah ah ah

Ah, I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah, I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah, I've got my love to keep me warm
Ah ah ah ah

Ah, I've got my love to keep me warm
