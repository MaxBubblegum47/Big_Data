I'm so blue, I don't know what to do
All day through, I'm pining just for you
I did wrong when I let you go away
For now I grieve about you night and day
I'm unhappy and dissatisfied
But I'd be happy if I had you by my side

If I could be with you, I'd love you strong
If I could be with you, I'd love you long
I want you to know I wouldn't go
Until I told you, honey, why I love you so

If I could be with you one hour tonight
If I was free to do the things I might
I'm telling you true, I'd be anything but blue
If I could be with you

All dressed up but still nowhere to go
How I wish that I could see a show
But here I wait with no one to call me dear
The one I love is many miles from here
Central, give me one-two-three-four-J
Oh, won't you listen, little sweetie, while I say

If I could be with you, I'd love you strong
If I could be with you, I'd love you long
I want you to know I wouldn't go
Until I told you, honey, why I love you so

If I could be with you one hour tonight
If I was free to do the things I might
I'm telling you true, I'd be anything but blue
If I could be with you
