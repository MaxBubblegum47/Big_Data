Yes, it's a good day for singing a song
And it's a good day for moving alone;
Yes, it's a good day, how could anything go wrong
A good day from morning' till night

Yes, it's a good day for shining your shoes
And it's a good day for losing the blues;
Everything go gain and nothing' to lose
'Cause it's a good day from morning' till night

I said to the Sun, "Good morning sun
Rise and shine today"
You know you've gotta get going
If you're gonna make a showin'
And you know you've got the right of way

'Cause it's a good day for paying your bills;
And it's a good day for curing your ills
So take a deep breath and throw away your pills;
'Cause it's a good day from morning' till night
