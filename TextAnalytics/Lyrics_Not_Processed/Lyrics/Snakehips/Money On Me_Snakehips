[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I know we ain't in Pebble Beach, Tahiti, or Miami Keys
But baby it's the rooftop, anything you want is yours
Swear to God, we can  get it all
Put the money on me
I know we ain't in LV, Magic City
Or the steamboat moving up to Mississippi
But let me hold a couple C-Notes
Play the whole scale in the key
Put the money on me
I know you ain't a risk seeker
Never ever seen your own peak
Never push it to the limit
Let me show you what to do with all these God damn lemons
I ain't tryna squeeze you
But put the money on me

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I woke up on a good one, came up on a good one
I'm working on a good one, working on a good one
A good one, put the money on me
Smoking on a good one, drinking on a good one
I came up on a good one, working on a good one
A good one, put the money on me

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Double up and bubble over, stand, look over my shoulder
I should probably take it slow
Kiss it, I'mma roll it over, and over, and over
Put the money on me
Papa need a peacoat, mama need a make over
Dollars need a bankroll, I can take you places you don't know
But we can't go until you put the money on me
Kobe need a new season, my wallet need a hundred Lincolns
My jug got a fuckin' leak in it, I'mma have to call it even
Jesus, you could at least put the money on me

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
I woke up on a good one, came up on a good one
I'm working on a good one, working on a good one
A good one, put the money on me
Smoking on a good one, drinking on a good one
I came up on a good one, working on a good one
A good one, put the money on me

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Three and the four and the six and the five, gotta be
Putting it all on the line, look at me
I was just about to let her go
Hey, I was just about to let her go, yeah, yeah
Said I was just about to let it go
Uh, uh, yeah said I was just about to let her go
Alright, yeah, to have sex
Was just about to let her go
I was just about to let her go, yeah, yeah
I was just about to let it go
Uh, uh, yeah said I was just about to let her go
Alright, yeah, to have sex
Was just about to let her go

[Hook + Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
I woke up on a good one, came up on a good one
I'm working on a good one, working on a good one
A good one, put the money on me
Smoking on a good one, drinking on a good one
I came up on a good one, working on a good one
A good one, put the money on me
