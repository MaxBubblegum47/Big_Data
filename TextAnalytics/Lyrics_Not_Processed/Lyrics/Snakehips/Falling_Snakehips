[Verse 1]
I could have swore I heard you calling
So I came running baby
Lost all control over my feet
Sky was black, rain poured in
Still I came running baby
And let my heart take hold of me

[Pre-Chorus]
You got the power
You’re sweet, you’re sour
Still you empower
All that I wanna to be
I’m captivated
Your so amazing
All that I’m craving
All that I need
Oh

[Chorus]
I’ll break down the walls
‘Cause to you I’m drawn
Do you hear me?
I’m gonna fall for you
You can have my all
At your beck and call
Do you feel me?
I’m gonna fall for you

[Hook]
Be, Be
I’ll be Yours
Be, Be
I’ll be yours
Be, Be
I’ll be yours
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I swore that we were getting closer
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
So I kept running baby
You were the spark to fuel my speed
Had my struggles, now they’re over
(Over) (Yes, love)
And there’s no more doubt here, baby
Because with you I feel at ease

[Pre-Chorus]
You got the power
You’re sweet, you’re sour
Still you empower
All that I wanna to be
I’m captivated
So, so amazing
All that I’m cravin’
All I’ll ever, ever need

[Chorus]
I’ll break down the walls
‘Cause to you I’m drawn
Do you hear me?
I’m gonna fall for you
You can have my all
At your beck and call
Do you feel me?
I’m gonna fall for you

[Bridge]
I'll never give up
I'm not gonna stop
Come hell or high water
Nothing is too much
Feet don't fail me now
‘Cause I can't back down
Just keep on calling
And I'll follow your sound

[Hook]
Be, be
I'll be yours
Be, be
I'll be yours
Be, be
I'll be yours
Ooh
Be be (I’m gonna be yours)
I'll be yours (yours)
Be, be
I'll be yours
(Now)

[Chorus]
I'll break down the walls
‘Cause to you I'm drawn
Do you hear me?
I'm gonna fall for you
You can have my all
At your beck and call
Do you feel me?
I'm gonna fall for you (Gonna fall)
I'll break down the walls
‘Cause to you I'm drawn (Ooh)
Do you hear me? (yeah)
I'm gonna fall for you
(Do you hear me, babe? Do you feel me, babe?)
