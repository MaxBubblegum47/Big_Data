[Intro: Tinashe]
Uh-huh, hoo

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure, I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bitter, brown salt, stinging on my tongue, ah
Heart will not waver, heart will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn
Burn your love into the ground with the lips of another
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely sometimes

[Chorus: Tinashe & Snakehips]
All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I hate the bar (IGH!)
Pharmacy addict, hear the Wall Street traffic
Took the car (IGH!)
We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at itâ€”skrrrt!
Crash on the floor, catch the z-z-z's (Hunh)
Popping the polar opposite of NZT (Hunh)
Hip-hop and the propaganda say they name-brand (Name-brand)
But I done seen how the 
*censored*
 did my main man (Main man)
The nights we won't remember are the nights we won't remember (IGH!)
I'll be gone 'til November, all my city call for Simba (IGH!)
Dreams are made for cages, nigga, lions are for real
Nigga, dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills (Woo!)
Nigga, fridays are for chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest-in-peace the recipe
The rest of us are praying that the sand will leave a tan
If you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying
Hope you hear what I'm saying

[Chorus: Tinashe & Snakehips]
All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red (Woo!)
I'm crawling back to your bed

[Bridge: Tinashe]
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely, some nights
When the angels on my shoulder slumber and I'm stuck here
With the vultures, hissing and circling
You didn't call me (Call me, call me, call me)

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe & 
Chance the Rapper
]
Ooh, I'm crawling, crawling
Crawling back to you (
IGH!
)

[Chorus: Tinashe & Snakehips, 
Chance the Rapper
, & 
All
]
All my friends are wasted (
All my friends are wasted
)
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much (
Too much, I drink too much
)
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed
All my friends are wasted
 (
All my friends are wasted
)
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed
