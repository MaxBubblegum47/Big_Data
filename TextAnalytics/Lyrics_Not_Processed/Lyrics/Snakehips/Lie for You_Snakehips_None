[Intro: Jess Glynne]
No, no
Ay, ay, no
Oh, I'd lie for you

[Verse 1: Jess Glynne]
You call, baby, I run
Don't need to know what you done
See you, holding that gun
I don't need to know
They come, running for you
But I know it ain't true
Swear I'll cover for you
They don't need to know
All the things that I'm thinking of, lately
Don't need to say you already know, it's crazy
Let's jump on a plane or just run, baby
You don't have to do it alone, whoa

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]
Oh, I'd lie for you
I can be your ears and eyes for you
Oh, I'd do time for you
And even if I couldn't, I'd try for you, oh
You got me and I know this
When you're losing I'd notice
I'd lie for you
Even if I shouldn't, I'd lie for you

[Verse 2: Davido]
Shawty, an angel
Came down from heaven, the space she I feel inside you
I know your intentions, follow your directions
'Cause you a blessing in disguise
I won’t lie, you relaxing my mind
Even when I got something bothering my mind
I stopped searching when I found you
Take your crown, my chargie
'Cause I dey really feel your vibe
When I'm down, girl, you recharge me
'Cause, baby, I really wanna change your life
Baby, I wanna see you bend, oh
I know you know say you be 10, oh
Bad girl from the ghetto
This love, I no fit, let go

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]
Oh, I'd lie for you
I can be your ears and eyes for you
Oh, I'd do time for you
And even if I couldn't, I'd try for you, oh
You got me and I know this
When you're losing I'd notice
I'd lie for you
Even if I shouldn't, I'd lie for you

[Verse 3: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Oh, na-na-na
Don't say you love me, talking rah, rah
You say you hate it when I see you cry (Cry)
You was my favorite 'cause you match my fly
Look, baby (Baby)
I could've left you when I fall, but I ain't that type
You lookin' for love, but I ain't that guy
Hit him in his slugg, had to paint that guy
'Cause he ain't down to ride
Thought you was my homie, wanna take my life
Talk behind my back and that's gon' get you sidelined
Most of these rappers be livin' fake lives
I hear them talking through a grapevine
I'm too original to fake mine
I, I broke her heart and let her take mine
I broke out her back, she needs another spine

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]
Said, oh, I'd lie for you
Oh, I'd lie for you
I can be your ears and eyes for you
Oh, I'd do time for you
And even if I couldn't, I'd try for you, oh
You got me and I know this
When you're losing, I'd notice
I'd lie for you
Even if I shouldn't, I'd lie for you
Oh, I'd lie for you
I can be your ears and eyes for you
Oh, I'd do time for you (I'd do time)
And even if I couldn't, I'd try for you, oh
You got me and I know this
When you're losing, I'd notice
I'd lie for you
Even if I shouldn't, I'd lie for you
