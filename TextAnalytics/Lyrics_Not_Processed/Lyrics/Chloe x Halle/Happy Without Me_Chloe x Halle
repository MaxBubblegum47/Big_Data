[Verse 1: Halle]
I remember we were on the bleachers sharing secrets
When we look up, it'd be "Where did the time go?"
And I remember you would hold my hand and call me baby
While we dancing in the parking lot so slow

[Pre-Chorus: Chloe]
Bittersweet, those memories
When I see you with her now

[Chorus: Chloe]
And it breaks my heart, and it breaks my heart (Yeah)
And it breaks my heart to see you happy without me

[Verse 2: Chloe]
Oh, I remember we would stay up late after the game
Look at the stars up in the sky in the nighttime
And I remember when you used to call me in the morning
Just to see if I was good and I slept right

[Pre-Chorus: Halle]
Bittersweet, (Bittersweet) those memories (Those memories)
When I see (When I see) you with her now

[Chorus: Halle]
And it breaks my heart, yeah it breaks my heart (Breaks my heart)
And it breaks my heart to see you happy

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah, I remember when we would cut class
Go to the park, just sit in the grass
Send me the spark 'cause I light up the gas
Telling you that I'm ahead anyway
I wish the feelings would just go away
I still be thinkin' 'bout you to this day
Sometimes I call you from private and just remain silent 'cause I do not know what to say, yuh
I know you stuck with the pain, yuh
I feel so fâ€”ing ashamed, yuh
Girl, let's be honest I told you, I promise that I wouldn't do it again, yuh
I know you stuck in your ways (Huh)
So much just push me away (Huh)
Now that I got a new flame
Glad that we're feeling the same, yeah

[Bridge: Halle & Joey Bada$$]
But the sun will come again (Yeah)
Maybe one day in the future (Yeah, yeah)
You'll come runnin' right back again
(You'll come runnin' back again)
Maybe one day in the future
(Maybe one day in the future yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
But I feel a little bit dumb, just a little bit sprung
Just a little too late
Oh, you call up those other chicks
I can't stop thinking it's lame missing you anyway

[Outro: Chloe x Halle]
And it breaks my heart, and it breaks my heart (Breaks my heart)
And it breaks my heart to see you happy without me
(Oh) And it breaks my heart, and it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart to see you happy without me
I feel a little bit dumb, just a little bit sprung, just a little too late
Now you call up those other chicks
I can't stop thinking, it's lame missing you anyway
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Without me
