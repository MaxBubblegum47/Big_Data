[Intro]
That's why the nice guys, they will always last
That's why the playboys always finish fast
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's nine o'clock
I get a text sayin', "Are you up?"
'Bout 9:15
My girl said she got the same message, same thing
A few days, yeah, we're cool
Then you disappear like I'm a fool (Yeah)
You told me that you with your family
My girl saw you with someone, leavin' the party

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I don't play with you
I spend a little time, don't stay with you
I tell you what you wanna hear all the time
Just because you're so damn fine

[Chorus]
Busy, busy boy
Busy boy, busy, busy boy, aren't you?
A busy, busy boy
Busy boy, busy, busy boy, aren't you?
A busy, busy boy
Busy boy, busy, busy boy, aren't you?
Busy, busy, busy boy
Busy boy, busy, busy boy (Oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
It's four o'clock
You sendin' me too many pictures of your... (Oh)
Baby, are you drunk?
Or did you mean to send it to another girl? (Another girl)
And by the way
I think I just stumbled on your girlfriend's page (Oh, no)
Congratulations
She sayin' that the baby comin' any day

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I just play with you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I spend a little time, don't stay with you (No, no, no, no)
You ain't never gonna get deep inside (Oh)
Even though you're so damn fine (Fine)

[Chorus]
Busy, busy boy
Busy boy, busy, busy boy, aren't you? (Yeah, yeah)
A busy, busy boy
Busy boy, busy, busy boy, aren't you? (Oh)
A busy, busy boy (Oh)
Busy boy, busy, busy boy, aren't you? (Oh)
Busy, busy, busy boy (Yeah)
Busy boy, busy, busy boy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
