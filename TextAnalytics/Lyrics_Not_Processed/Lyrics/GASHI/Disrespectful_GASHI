[Chorus]
Seen you from a far way
You was talking side ways
If you wanna start shit
Just know that we gon' pop quick
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
(Get the fuck outta my face)

[Verse 1]
I'm posted with my clique, we ain't never flinch
Credit card work the wrist
, 
Lebron with the chip
All this sauce made us slip, when I walk I drip
We don't care that you rich, you corny little bitch
I started all the vibes, started all the waves
Could've made it in my country
, 
took it to the States
I'm feeling like I'm Ace, giving all the fades
Hit and run, they starving, taking pics of my plates
Movin' it quick, 
tryna get rich and I'm dodgin' these sticks
Got head in the Uber, then call me a Lyft
She pissed but it is what it is what it is
Girl, I'm stuck up in my ways, yeah, my ways, yeah
You can call me when you naked, you naked
Excuse me, respect the motherfuckin' set (Get it)
Bottle service 'cause you know we love to flex (Hey)
Money double up when I fuck a check
Bitch, I got now, fuck who got next

[Chorus]
Seen you from a far way
You was talking side ways
If you wanna start shit
Just know that we gon' pop quick
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
(Get the fuck outta my face)

[Verse 2]
Thank God I don't ever gotta beg or borrow
I'm stuffing up that mattress case I fall tomorrow
You know now my whole squad really got me
Know the difference with who's down and who's around me
It it is what it is, 
stacking these chips, got my momma a crib
Doing this shit 'cause you know that it's lit
Got the baddest bitches all on my dick
Copped me a whip (Skrrt)
Copped me a whip (Skrrt, skrrt)
Bitch I'm different, too consistent
All my ex-es talking crazy, they be tripping
Hit my phone right before the show, ask for tickets
Bitch, you should know this shit sold out, why you visit?
Come and see me in the back, freaks show me love, girl you know that you a dub
Met her ass up in the club, hate it when I throw them ones
But she know that I am the one
I'm up before the sun for my future sons

[Chorus]
Seen you from a far way
You was talking side ways
If you wanna start shit
Just know that we gon' pop quick
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
Disrespect me
And I'm real disrespectful
(Get the fuck outta my face)
