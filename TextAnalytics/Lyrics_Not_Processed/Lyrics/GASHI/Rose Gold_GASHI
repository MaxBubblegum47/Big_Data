[Intro]
I've been riding

[Verse 1]
You know I'm riding with my bro's, Quick to let it go
Pay all my taxes, I never pay for hoes
I always gotta get it, Never finish
I talk too much, Ya'll don't never listen
I'm ducking I'm ducking these feds
You heard what I said, I'm chasing this bread
I'm feeling so stressed
But it could be worse so I should feel blessed
It could be worse
And Imma get everything I deserve
Sick of seeing mama cry
I hope that one day mama seeing that I try
I hope I make it before my parents die
I hope they see that I ain't playing tonight
Cause if you test me boy I'm letting it go
I'm letting it fly, You can tell em 'bout it by the
Looking my eyes
Lord you can take my soul, If I lied
And tell this bitch get off my dick, If she ain't' gon' ride
If she ain't gon' ride

[Hook]
I wanted the big face rose gold Rolie
Never needed no friends cuz I know you was phony
And my rap’s supreme my babe looking cozy
And you mad cuz you know you can’t control me
I wanted the big face rose gold Rolie
Never needed no friends cuz I know you was phony
And my rap’s supreme my babe looking cozy
And you mad cuz you know you can’t control me

[Bridge]
(Free Gucci)
Ah! (Take a second, You know it baby)
Shout out my brother Dre (Go back in)
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
They ain't rooting for me
They ain't clapping for me
They ain't happy for me
But I'm happy for me
Shqipe
 We Made It
Happy belated
I graduated
I ain't no Tony Montana
But fucking your bitch on a banana boat
And you hatin'
I came straight up of the boat
You pussy boys ya get exposed
Talkin' shit I hope you know I know
Without a deal I'm still on the road
I'm running through your bitch with my bro's
I'm running through your bitch with my bro's
Oh yeah!
I did it, I did it, I did it
Man up on toe and I hit it
Ima DM you the pictures

[Chorus]
I wanted the big face rose gold Rolie
Never needed no friends cuz I know you was phony
And my rap’s supreme my babe looking cozy
And you mad cuz you know you can’t control me
I wanted the big face rose gold Rolie
Never needed no friends cuz I know you was phony
And my rap’s supreme my babe looking cozy
And you mad cuz you know you can’t control me
Oah!

[Outro]
You gonna lose your mind
Tryna understand what the fuck's in mine

Tryna understand what the fuck's in mine
You gonna lose your mind
Tryna understand what the fuck's in mine
You gonna lose your mind
Tryna understand what the fuck's in mine
