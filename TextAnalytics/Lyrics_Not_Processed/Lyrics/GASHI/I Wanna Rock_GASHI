[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I don't want friends, I just want M's (M's)
I don't follow trends, I just follow tens (Tens)
Every other week I'ma make a M (M)
I told her, if you make it hard turn it to a ten (Ten)
I'm the type to drop the top while she gives me top
Still the white boy in the club that can't Milly Rock (Rock)
Still the same and I made a milli off of pop (Pop)
Come to the land of the hyphy, I'm a juggernaut (Juggernaut)
I don't fuck with Xans, I grew up on Pac (Grew up on Pac)
I get love in Houston the way I rap a lot (I rap a lot)
I don't eat bacon, I don't fuck with cops
If I kill the best alive, then it's suicide
May 24th, I'm a Gemini (I'm a Gemini)
Not a one hit wonder, this is why I'm hot (Why I'm hot)
No Limit, all I got is Me, Myself & I
When I said it's her and I, that shit was a lie (Yup)

If you feel better, you can hate me then
If you feel better, you can hate me then
If you feel better, you can hate me then
If you feel better, you can hate me then

We gon' let the haters hate again (Hate again)
Top blown while we speedin' in the latest Benz (Latest Benz)
Latest Benz, Mercedes-Benz (Mercedes-Benz)
Go under, she said ain't nobody better than (Better than)
She give me head, make me feel like the president (The president)
I'm cumming while I'm thumbing through these presidents

Gotta shine like a star (Shine), we above all the law (Law)
Way too many drugs, I do not trust a cop (Nah)
I ran into the plug and I'm not running off (Off)
I love my niggas also my mom made a boss (Yeah)
No, we're not showing love, it's a line you did cross (Cross)
None of my bitches scrubs, this is dyin' just to talk (Talk)
They dissin', they playin' with us then you bound to get caught (Caught)
I'm feelin' lil' shawty love, lookin' fine when she walk (Walk)
I might just spend a lil' dub, I keep mine in the vault (Vault)
We livin' it for the club, I be flyin' like a hawk
Flyin' like a hawk (Yeah)
