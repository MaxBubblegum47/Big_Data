[Verse 1]
Tootsies on the top floor spending dough
5:45 and I'm gettin' dome
If you didn't know, bitch, now you know
Pop that pussy, pop a pill, then leave me alone, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
First I gotta break it, then I gotta take it
Now I'm feelin' all wavy, yeah, I'm feelin' amazing
Please don't try to wake me 'cause I'm on vacation
'Bout to start goin' crazy, yeah, I'm feelin' faded

[Chorus]
You got me losing my mind
Every night I pop another pill to sleep
They keep saying there ain't nothin' wrong with me
I'm just so obsessed with how things used to be, used to be

[Verse 2]
Tell them they don't know what they think they know
Seen it all before, seen it all before
Best friends switchin' sides, now it's fuck â€˜em all
Getting high all alone, please don't call my phone, switch up

[Pre-Chorus]
First I gotta break it, then I gotta take it
Now I'm feelin' all wavy, yeah, I'm feelin' amazing
Please don't try to wake me 'cause I'm on vacation
'Bout to start goin' crazy, yeah, I'm feelin' faded

[Chorus]
You got me losing my mind
Every night I pop another pill to sleep
They keep saying there ain't nothin' wrong with me
I'm just so obsessed with how things used to be, used to be

[Post-Chorus]
For a while ain't no child with a style like me
I can tell that these boys wanna sound like me
Got my 4's and they all gonna ride for me
Shoot you from the neck up like a fuckin' ID
For a while ain't no child with a style like me
I can tell that these boys wanna sound like me
Got my 4's and they all gonna ride for me
Shoot you from the neck up like a fuckin' ID

[Outro]
Used to be
