[Verse 1]
If I work hard every day
For my money
If I work my finger down to the bone
That isn't funny
Now if I see
Something I can't buy
I put a dollar down
Then I try try try
To get my money
I need my money
A woman who hasn't got a dime
I can't use her no
If she has got no cash money
I've got to refuse her

[Chorus]
I need a woman
With a whole lot of will
So she help me, baby
Help me pay my bill
I need my money
I've got to have money

[Verse 2]
I need loving to give me a living
So don't ask me I don't need forgiving
I will stand up to count the cost
But I know I won't stand the loss

[Chorus]
I need a woman
With a whole lot of will
She can help me pay my bill
I need my money
I want my money

[Verse 3]
Before I say my prayers
I count my money
When I wake up
It has to be there
My money
You see, love--it don't mean a thing
When she loves you
She can't bring, can't bring you no money
I've got to have my money

[Outro]
Looking for loving
I need a living
