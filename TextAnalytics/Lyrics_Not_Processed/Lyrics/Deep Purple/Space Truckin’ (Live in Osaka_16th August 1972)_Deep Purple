Well, we had a lot of luck on Venus
We always had a ball on Mars
Meeting all the groovy people
We've rocked the Milky Way so far
We danced around with Borealis
We're space truckin' 'round the the stars
Come on, let's go space truckin'
Come on
Space truckin'
Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way
We'd move to the Canaveral moonstop
And every 'naut would dance and sway
We got music in our solar system
We're space truckin' round the stars
Come on, let's go space truckin'
The fireball that we rode was moving
But now we've got a new machine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah the freaks said
Man, those cats can really swing
They got music in their solar system
They've rocked around the Milky Way
They've danced around the Borealis
They're space truckin' every day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Space truckin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Space truckin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Space truckin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Space truckin'
