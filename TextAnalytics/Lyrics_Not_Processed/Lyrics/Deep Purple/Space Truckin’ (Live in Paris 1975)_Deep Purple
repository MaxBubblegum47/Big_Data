Well we had a lot of luck on Venus
We always have a ball on Mars
With meeting all the groovy people
We've rocked the Milky Way so far
We danced around with Borealis
We're space trucking round the stars
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go Space trucking
Come on, come on, come on, Space trucking
Remember when we did the moonshot
And Ronny Trekker led the way
We'd move to the Canaveral Moonstomp
And every naut would dance and way
We got music in our solar system
We're space trucking round the stars
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go Space trucking
Come on, come on, come on, Space trucking
The fireball that we rode way moving
But now we've got a new machine
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! the frenks say
Man those cats can really swing
They got music in their solar system
They've rocked around the Milky Way
They dance around with Borealis
They're space trucking every day
Come on, come on, come on
Let's go Space trucking
Come on, come on, come on, Space trucking
