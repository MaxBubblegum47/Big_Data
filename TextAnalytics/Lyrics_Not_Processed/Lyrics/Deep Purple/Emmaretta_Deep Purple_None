[Pre-Chorus 1]
Emmaretta
Did you get my letter
I sent it to you
Oh, Emmaretta

[Chorus 1]
Do you still feel
When night is falling
Something's calling
Oh, Emmaretta

[Verse]
Behind my thoughts
Oh, Emmaretta
I can get to you
To feel better
I must go now
Oh, Emmaretta
Full moon's rising
Oh, Emmaretta

[Chorus 2][x2]
Oh, it's a thousand miles
Oh, and I need you, child
Oh, they can drive me wild
What I feel and make it real

[Pre-Chorus 1]

[Chorus 1]
