[Chorus]
You can walk through fire
Make the north wind blow
Squeeze and tease me, honey
When you shake your body

[Verse]
You move my soul, my, yeah
Let me be your lover
Won't you let me be your child?
Take me through your universe
You know that when you smile
You drive me wild, oh, my baby
Love child
Driving me wild
Love child
Always teasing me
You can ride your pony
Daydream in fairy tales
All I know is I need more
When I see you dance the seven veils

[Bridge]
Oh, baby, let me shake it
You got me shaking, babe
You got me shaking, baby

[Chorus]
