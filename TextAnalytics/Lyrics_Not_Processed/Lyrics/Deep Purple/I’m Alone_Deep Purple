On the lonely road I'm travelling on
The road that leads nowhere
As the ground and the sky, wondering why
I'm alone, so alone

I kept rolling on from tears for years
Sun is my only friend
With the wind on the bend and my pack in my hand
I'm alone, so alone

I'm alone, so alone
I'm alone, so alone
I'm alone, so alone
And I feel like going home

With my money spent, my clothes all torn
My spirit can't grow
I ain't got no friend where the power ends
I'm alone, so alone

I'm alone, so alone
I'm alone, so alone
I'm alone, so alone
And I feel like going home
