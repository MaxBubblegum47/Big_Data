[Verse 1]
Break my back with hard loving'
[?] the gap and keep shovin'
You can see I need lovin'
Oh, oh, ah
Come on honey

[Chorus]
I'm a hard loving man

[Verse 2]
What's your name? It's alright now
Trick or treat, we're uptight now
You can see it's alright now
Oh, oh, ah
Come on honey, you know what I like

[Chorus]
I'm a hard loving man

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You're so nice, two good handfuls
I can see in my handles
You can't see forward, it's all over
Oh, oh, oh, ah
Come on honey, just one more time

[Chorus]
I'm a hard loving man
