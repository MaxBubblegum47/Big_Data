[Verse 1]
I don't care if my lady's gone
As long as you give me just what I want
I've been losing my direction
Got to find a new connection
You have wasted the love I tasted
Now I'm really getting hungry more and more
Been a long time, had a bad sign
Tell me what am I fighting for?

[Chorus]
Let me know you feel it
You know I really need it
Keep on pushing for more
Lay down, stay down
I got something to find
There's one thing I really need
I'm going to tell you right now
Lay down, stay down

[Verse 2]
Looking for trouble, I guess that's right
When I was young I was taught to fight
It's been long gone since I had known
Now I'm heading for some more

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus][x2]
