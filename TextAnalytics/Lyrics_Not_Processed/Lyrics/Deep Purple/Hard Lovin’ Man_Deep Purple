[Verse 1]
Break my back with hard loving
Take my hand and keep moving
Don't slow down we're nearly there now
Oh can you stand the pain

[Chorus]
I'm a hard loving man

[Organ/Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
What's your name? It's alright now
Trick or treat we're uptight now
Want to feel you I want to hear you
Oh here we go again

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Come back here it's not over
Can't you see there's still time girl
I can last make if fast now
Oh gotta catch a train

[Chorus]

[Instrumental outro]

[Guitar solo]
