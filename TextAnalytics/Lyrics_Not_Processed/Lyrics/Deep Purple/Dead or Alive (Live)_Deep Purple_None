Don't turn off the light you might draw the queen of spades
Don't shut the door you don't need to be alone
I won't bring you no food might be some poison in your meat
Tell me now I gotta know
If you're dead or alive
I got to know if you're dead or alive
Dead or alive
Pick your window you're leaving
Don't look in the mirror with a dollar up your face
You've got money to burn cheap at half the price
Have money to buy a [Incomprehensible] face I can't turn around
Tell me, I gotta know
If you're dead or alive
I got to know if you're dead or alive
Dead or alive
Pick your window you're leaving, leaving
You're running so fast but you know you're standing still
Wasn't singin' in my fear and the knife in your hand

[Incomprehensible] to the tune of the dealer
And he don't care, don't give a toss, don't want to know
If you're dead or alive
Don't give a toss if you're dead or alive
Dead or alive
Pick your window you're leaving, leaving
Dead or alive
