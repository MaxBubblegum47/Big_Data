Well I'm out of work, out of hope
I got mouths to feed and I'm stony broke
The rum's all gone and I could sure use a smoke
I can't help thinking how it used to be
Everybody danced till a quarter to three
Living on the wild side, getting our kicks
How'd I ever end up in a place like this?
Oh, get me outta here
Somebody get me outta here
Three blind bastards parked on a bench
One said to the other, hey who's your friend?
That's how it started way back when
A shit-load of ways to communicate
One hates love, another loves hate
And now you're gonna tell me there's no end in sight
And next thing you know we're getting ready to fight
Oh yeah, get me outta here
Get me outta here
I got to tell you that I'm feeling rough
Been good to know you but I've had enough
You say pull yourself together and get a grip
You can stick it up your jacksie 'cause I'm jumping ship
Oh yeah, get me out of here
That's it away, oh yeah
Outta here
Adi√≥s, muchachos
Au revoir
Outta here
Auf wiedersehen, my darling
Get me outta here

[...]
See you, suckers
