[Verse]
I was born a rambling man
And I never got the chance
To settle down and get a hold on love
Taking air and moving around
Is all I can see that I'm doing
And it is bringing me down
Driving on a highway going nowhere
Desolation destination
Guess I'll find it somewhere
I know if there's trouble
I am not taking the blame
That's why I keep moving
So nobody knows my name
Born a loser
I'm beyond the law
Women behind me
Never can find me
They can never get together
What I've been here for
Because I'm a drifter
Rolling on
I'm not wasting my time no more
