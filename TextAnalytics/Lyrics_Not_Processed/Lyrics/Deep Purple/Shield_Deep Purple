[Verse 1]
Mama plays a queen
On the hill built on a dream
While the children play in the field
Papa smokes the pipe
Of a sweet and better life
But how strong is the shield?
Can peace be found
On the carpet above ground
Where sky is forever blue
So let it pass baby now
The slow and riding cloud
Which may take me from you

[Verse 2]
Many things a man can lose
His self, his rights, his views
But never his heart or his love
So take this hand of mine
And climb baby, climb
To the hill up above
Now you can play a queen
On the hill built on a dream
While our children play in the field
I can smoke the pipe
Of a sweet and better life
And trust in the strength of the shield

[Verse 3]
So trust in you love, and Lucy of above
And let light pass like a wheel
Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance
Kiss the strength of the shield
The seeker will be found
By the looker on the ground
And to his wish he will yield
Fate will have it's word, of course
And time will change its course
And hold the strength of the shield
