[Spoken]
Descending the cold steps of the institution for the politically insane
Never to be seen again
Saying farewell to daylight
From henceforth I shall rot in a stinking bed of wet straw

[Verse 1]
Right from the ashes of life I learned to behave
What to believe, what not to say, from cradle to grave
Ah, like a good little slave
Sucking my milk from the venomous tit of the state
That's clearly designed to suppress every thought of escape
Ah, I surrender to fate

[Chorus]
No pity, no pity
Don't want no pity for me in this filthy cell
Wow, I'll see you in Hell
See you in Hell

[Verse 2]
Frozen in time, I'm a specimen pinned to my throne
With an army of butterflies pilloried, placid and prone
Ah, we are never alone

[Chorus]
No pity, no pity
Don't want no pity for me in this filthy cell
I'll see you in hell

[Spoken]
After centuries of living with nothing but my convictions
Broken fingers clawing through the walls of my incarceration
Escaping the clutches of eternal damnation
I was justified
