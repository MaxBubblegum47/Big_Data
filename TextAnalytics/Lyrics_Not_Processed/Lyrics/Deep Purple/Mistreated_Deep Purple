[Chorus]
I've been mistreated, I've been abused
I've been struck downhearted, baby, I've been confused
'Cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated
Since my baby left me, I've been losing my mind, you know I have

[Verse]
I've been lonely, I've been cold
I've been looking for a woman to have and hold
'Cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated
Since my baby left me, I've been losing, I've been losing
I've been losing my mind, baby baby babe

[Instrumental break 3:05-4:36]
[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
I've been mistreated, I've been abused
I've been looking for a woman, yeah, I've been confused
'Cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated
Since my baby left me, I've been losing, losing
I've been losing my mind, baby baby babe
Oh oh oh, oh woman, oh woman, oh woman

[Instrumental break 6:03-7:12]
[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
I've been losing my mind
