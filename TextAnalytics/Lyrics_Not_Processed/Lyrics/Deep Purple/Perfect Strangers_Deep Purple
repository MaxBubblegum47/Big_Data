[Verse 1]
Can you remember, remember my name?
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Oh, oh-oh-oh
And cold, cold spirits of ice, ah, ah
All my life
I am the echo of your past
I am returning the echo of a point in time
And distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
Oh, oh-oh-oh
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your life
Shadows of another day

[Chorus]
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain perfect strangers

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, no

[Bridge]
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

[Verse 2]
A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind, oh-oh-oh
Is aching with the dead of the night
Oh, oh, oh, precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

[Chorus]
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain perfect strangers

[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, yeah
