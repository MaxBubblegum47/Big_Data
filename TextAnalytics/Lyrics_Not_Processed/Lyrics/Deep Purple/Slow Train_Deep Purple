How can you live in such a state?
Your mind is empty and you're full of hate
The things you say and the things you do
Mark you down as a helpless fool

I know, I know, I know, I know
It's gonna be all right through the night
Tomorrow comes and you're full of shame
Oh baby! You play the crying game

Aaaah...

Gonna be a long time baby
Before we get it sorted out all right
I'll drag you off to Utopia, baby
We'll end up heading south

I need, I need, I need to know
If you're gonna do me right
If you do the things I ask of you
I'll tell the world tonight

He he he he hee... All right

You do me right, you do me wrong
Tell me, where do I belong?
You do me up, you do me down
I accept it all without a frown

You live like a woman in a fantasy
Ha ha I admire you from my tree
You drain my life and you drain my brain
I end up running back again

I love, I love, I love the funny ways
Oh you throw me in a daze
If you ever left me woman
I'd destroy myself, sure as hell

Aaaah...

We're gonna ride a slow train baby
And take all the whistle stops - oh yes we are
We'll pull down the blinds while the carriage grinds
And the engine grunts and pops
Well there's a city, Jamie cryin' 'bout the fussin' goin' on
So I'll burn her Times to ash
Well there's a lot to live but there's a lot to give
Ready! Steady! Smash!

Alright! Yeah! Uh mmh!

You just got to be out of your head
When you say you're good looking from bottom to top
Well I'll be waiting, to give her the rent
When you pass 'til you say you want a sock hop
Well there's a nightmare howling like there's something going on
And it's going to aim the pain
Oh, just like me he fell in love
Ah now he feels the pain

Aaaah....

Gonna ride a slow train baby
And take all the whistle stops - oh yes we are
We'll pull down the blinds while the carriage grinds
Engine grunts and pops
Well there's a city, Jamie cryin' 'bout the fussin' goin' on
So I'll burn her Times to ash
And there's a lot to live and there's a lot to give
Ready! Steady! Smash!
