[Verse 1]
My mama showed me how to rock in the cradle
But I learned how to roll along
My papa said, Son, got to get some fun
Because when you're old, it isn't too good on your own

[Chorus 1]
Been so long, since you heard my song
Going to pick up my guitar and play
Felt so bad when I had to leave you
But I knew that I'd be back some day

[Chorus 2]
So I'm coming home
To give you more than you bargained for
Coming home
No mistake, I'm going to shiver and shake

[Chorus 3]
Coming home
Going to rock and roll and give you my soul
Coming home
I got over the pain I'm coming home again

[Verse 2]
Grooving to American Bandstand
B.B. on stage with 'Lucille'
The thrill is gone but, it won't be for long
Because you know I like to play how I feel
Now that we're all back together
Going to shiver and shake all night
Just got to say the music I play
Will sure enough make you feel alright
Though I learned how to rock in the cradle
And rolling came so easy to me
All the years I traveled the world
Made it so clear to see

[Chorus 1]
It's been so long since you heard my song
Going to pick up my guitar and play
Felt so bad when I had to leave you
But I knew that I'd be back some day

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Outro]
Coming home
Shiver and shaking anticpating
Coming home
The thrill is gone but it won't be for long
Coming home
