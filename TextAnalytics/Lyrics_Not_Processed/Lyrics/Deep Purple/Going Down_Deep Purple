Going down
Down, down, down, down, down
Going down
Down, down, down, down, down
Got my feet in the window
My mind on the ground
Let me down
Close that boxcar door
Let me down
Slam that boxcar door
Well, I’m going to Chattanooga
And sleep on sister Irene’s floor
Going down
Down, down, down, down, down
Going down
Down, down, down, down, down
Got my big feet in the window
