[Intro]
Well, if you hear somebody knocking on your door
If you see something crawling across the floor
Baby, it'll be me, and I'll be looking for you

[Verse]
If you see a head a-peeping from a crawdad hole
If you see somebody climbing up a telephone pole
Baby, it'll be me, and I'll be looking for you
Going to look on the mountain and in the deep blue sea
Going to search all the forests and look and look in every tree
Well, if you feel something heavy on your fishing hook
If you see a funny face in your comic book
Baby, it'll be me, and I'll be looking for you
If you hear a thought a-calling out in the night
If you see somebody hanging from a lamppost bright
Baby, it'll be me, and I'll be looking for you
If you see somebody looking in all the cars
If you see a rocket ship on its way to Mars
Baby, it'll be me, and I'll be looking for you
Going to look in the city where the lights are blue
Going to search the countryside, all the haystacks, too

[Outro]
If you see a new face on a totem pole
If you find a lump in your sugar bowl
Baby, it'll be me, and I'll be looking for you
