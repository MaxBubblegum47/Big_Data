[Verse 1]
Spread the word around
The rat is leaving town
The message is a song
The misery is gone
Once I had a dream
To sing before the queen
She didn't want to know
She wouldn't see the show
What a fright
I couldn't do it right
Oh what a night
Mystic Demons fly
All about the sky
With memories of a clown
The saddest show in town
When I was seventeen
My mother said to me
Be careful what you touch
You shouldn't take so much
I blew my mind
She was so kind
I could have cried
In my mind
I had to find
A kind of new way
Of being oh so cool
Like a blue blooded
Well studded
English fool
Speak about the past
Times are changing fast
Once I was so weak
I couldn't even speak

[Pre-Chorus]
Shaking out a curse
Nothing could be worse
Walking through the door
Who could ask for more

[Chorus]
Now I'm free
And I can see
And I can see

[Bridge]
Spread the word around
The rat is leaving town
The message is a song
The misery is gone

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Now I'm free
And I can see
And I am me

[Outro]
Please stay away
