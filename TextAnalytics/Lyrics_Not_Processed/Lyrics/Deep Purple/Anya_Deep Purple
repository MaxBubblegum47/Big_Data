[Verse 1]
I'm so far away
From everything you know
Your name is carried on the wind
Your ice blue waters Anya
Where do they flow
Where have they been [2x]

A hidden passion
Touching a spark
Flame of revolution
Burning wild in your gypsy heart
Your gypsy heart

[Chorus]
Anya - The spirit of freedom
Anya - Oh Anya

[Verse 2]
The light of freedom buried
Deep within your soul
Across the puszta plain to see
The rhapsody of angels
Refuse to dance alone
What do they mean [2x]

Your jewel flashing
Across the dark
Forbidding distance
I love your gypsy heart
Your gypsy heart

[Chorus]
Anya - The spirit of freedom
Anya - Oh Anya
