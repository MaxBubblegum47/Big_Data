In a dark and sweaty room in sixty nine
Tables turning
Dancing girls, silly girls, all kinds of girls
And it was loud
Tuning up to madness in the back room
Candles burning
Present the stinking hippy
And throw the naked thunder to the crowd

Oh, in the hungry daze

The long and lonely highway drags along
It's going nowhere
Sickness and disease and mad corruption
Something's going wrong
The mountain's getting cold and lonely
The trees are bare
We all came out to Montreux
But that's another song
You've heard it all before

In hungry daze
Back in the hungry daze
Back in hungry daze
Back in hungry daze
Ha!

Along the mountain road to do some drinking
And now we're mobile again
Different girls, laughing girls, forever girls
And it's so loud
Crew have lost again
Ah, they are beaten men
The winning team united
Living for the crowd

These are the hungry daze
These are
These are hungry daze
Hungry daze
Oh, oh, oh, hungry daze
Hungry daze
These are the hungry daze
Ah, hungry daze

Ooh, hungry daze
Hungry daze
Hungry daze
