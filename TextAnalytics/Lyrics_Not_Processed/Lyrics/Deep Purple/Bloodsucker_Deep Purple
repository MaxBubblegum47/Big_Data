[Verse 1]
Got a black breast Chinese eyes
Got an English brain that's going to make me wise
Got a long story that I want to tell
To a rhythm that I know so well

[Chorus]
Really got a lot of loving that I want to give
Baby I'm a mystery but you know I got to live
I tried another but she didn't want to know

[Verse 2]
Take a hold now if you can
Take a lesson from a hard loving man
I'm a long way from where I want to go
Guess I'll stay awhile I really love you so
How's about another sip of all the wine you got
Take a tip from me and give it here I'll drink the lot
I'm not a whiny I'm a putting on a show
You really grab me but I've got to move
Before they know I'm here and spread the news
Maybe in a while when I've moved around
I can find a way to pay you back your twenty pounds

[Chorus]

[Dueling Guitar/Organ solo]
