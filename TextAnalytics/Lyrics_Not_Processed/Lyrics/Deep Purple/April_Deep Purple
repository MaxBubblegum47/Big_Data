[Verse]
April is a cruel time
Even though the sun may shine
And world looks in the shade
As it slowly comes away
Still fall, the April rain
And the valley's filled with pain
And you can't tell if I cry
As I look up to the

[Chorus]
Grey sky, where it should be blue
Grey sky, where I should see you
Ask why, why it should be so?
I'll cry, say that I don't know

[Bridge]
Maybe once in a while
I'll forget and I'll smile
But then the feeling comes again
Of an April without end
Of an April lonely as they come
In the dark of my mind
I can see all too fine
But there is nothing to be done
When I just can't feel the sun
And the springtime's the season of the night

[Chorus]
Grey sky, where it should be blue
Grey sky, where I should see you
Ask why, why it should be so?
I'll cry, say that I don't know
I don't know
