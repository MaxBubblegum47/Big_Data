[Intro]
In ages past when spells were cast
In a time of men in steel
When a man was taught no special thing
It was all done by feel

[Chorus]
So listen, so learn, so read on
You got to turn the page
Read the Book of Taliesyn

[Verse 1]
Hear the song of lovely Joan
Her sound so sweet and clear
In the courtroom of the King
Among children and the peers

[Chorus]
So listen, so learn, so read on
You got to turn the page
Read the Book of Taliesyn

[Bridge]
"Now hear ye the words of Taliesyn
On the foaming beach of the ocean
In the day of trouble
I shall be of more service to thee
Than three hundred salmon
The hare he bounds across the page
Past castles white and fair
Past dreaming chessmen on their boards
With a fool's mate as a snare

[Chorus]
So listen, so learn, so read on
You got to turn the page
Read the Book of Taliesyn

[Verse 2]
Three times I have been born
I know this from meditation
The bird he flies the distance
From pages two to six
Past minstrels in their boxes
To the waters of the Styx

[Chorus]
So listen, so learn, so read on
You got to turn the page
Read the Book of Taliesyn

[Verse 3]
Don't take the pictures lightly
Listen to their sound
For from their coloured feeling
Experience is found

[Chorus]
So listen, so learn, so read on
You got to turn the page
Read the Book of Taliesyn

[Outro]
All the sciences of the world
Are collected in my breast
For I know what has been, what is now
And what hereafter will occur
