[Verse 1]
I've been to places where the sun goes down
Each day and never rises
I've been to places in a dark room
Where we played with our disguises

[Chorus]
Heaven, I'm in heaven
I'm in seventh heaven now
Seventh heaven

[Verse 2]
It was a dream, I heard a voice
I put it down to wishful thinking
It was a dream, a silent scream
Out of the blue, a new beginning

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And then I fell upon a stroke of luck
That led to my good fortune
And then I fell upon my knees
And gently kissed the ground you walk on

[Chorus]
