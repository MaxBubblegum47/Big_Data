[Verse 1]
Oh you're all looking up
With hearts of devotion
Through the dust and the heat lost to me
In a cloud of emotion
I have no motivation
To keep this breathless pace
I'm more inclined to stay here
In this breathing space

[Chorus]
And the sun goes down
And the moon comes up

[Verse 2]
I never tried to walk the walk
Because the steps are elusive
The membership is too costly
And exclusive
Hey, the more I've got
The more I stand to lose
So I'm going to unpack my bags
And take off my shoes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Let me tell you there's no point knocking
At the big oak door
Can't you see that it's all full up
They can't take no more
The line's so long
It's almost Disney
Ooh:
Won't somebody kiss me

[Chorus]
