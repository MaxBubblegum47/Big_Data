You're lazy... Just stay in bed
You're lazy... Just stay in bed
You don't want no money
You don't want no bread oh no

If you're drowning
You don't clutch no straw
No no, if you're drowning
You don't clutch no straw
You don't want to live
You don't want to cry no more no no

Well my trying ain't done no good
I said my trying ain't done no good
You don't make no effort
No not like you should

Lazy... You just stay in bed
Lazy... You just stay in bed
You don't want no money
You don't want no bread
Yeah
