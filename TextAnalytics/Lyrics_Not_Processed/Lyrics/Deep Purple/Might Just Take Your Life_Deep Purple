[Verse 1]
I got more than I asked for
There isn't nothing I need
I took all till I had more
I'm always taking the lead
Old man shaking dice down on the street
Try'n to make a living somehow
But I'm really sure about getting things sorted out
And I'm getting ready right now

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't hold me
I have told you

[Chorus]
Might just take your life
Might just take your life

[Verse 2]
I've been called by many names
And all of them are bad
I can take it all the same
It's all I've ever had
I've got something that you can't get
But one thing you can see
Getting there isn't easy
But it sure was hard for me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Every time I take a look
There's someone close behind
They never used to make a pass
The things that crossed their minds
Now they tell me that it's all right
And they want to be my friend
They're riding on my back
When is it going to end?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Might just take your life
Might just take your life
Might just take your life

[Outro][x3]
Got more than I asked for
Got more than I need
