Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just a little song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia on my mind
Georgia, Georgia
Just a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
My Georgia, my Georgia
No peace I find
Just a little song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
