[Verse 1]
I read in the news
That the average man
Is uplifted five times a day
I'm confused
I have to confess
My feeling never goes away
I know it's right
They asked the average man
In a survey across the nation
I can't understand how the average man
Keeps losing his concentration

[Chorus]
Oh you got to use it
Oh you going to lose it

[Verse 2]
I'm just begun
When you're all done
I see you running down the road
Can't hear a thing
My mind is blasted
And my head is about to explode
Feeling the pain
Just more of the same
As we're rolling through the night
Going so fast
We're sure to nit the next town
Before the last one's out of sight

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Back to back
One on one
Shake it up
Move it on
Back to back
One on one
Turn it up
Hold it down
