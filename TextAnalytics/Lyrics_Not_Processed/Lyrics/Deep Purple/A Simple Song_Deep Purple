[Intro]
Time, it does not matter
But time is all we have
To think about, think about

[Verse 1]
Road, it has no end
Crossroads every turn
So it goes, so it goes

[Chorus]
Once you sang
A simple song
Got confused
Went on too long
Why does the promise fade
You lie on the bed you make

[Verse 2]
Stranger than fiction
Further from the truth
Beyond imagination
Those seeds have taken root
Wild as a dream could be
From black and white
To blue and red
Golden circles
Flow above your head

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Once you sang
A simple song
It all went wrong
Time, it does not matter
Time is all we have
