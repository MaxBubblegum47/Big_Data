Chasing shadows, over my walls
With myself hardly sleeping
Dwarfs and giants, twenty feet tall
Fill the room with their creeping

Sounds of breathing sharpen my ears
Then they fade into nothing
Someone's laughter out in the street
Fills the night with their loving

I feel the ice in my head
Running its hands through my bed
Not even dreaming I seem to be dead
Colours of yellow and colours of red

All I'm asking some secret voice
Is to lead me to darkness
I'm so tired, dawn never comes
I just lie in the shadows

All I'm asking some secret voice
Is to lead me to darkness
I'm so tired, dawn never comes
I just lie in the shadows

I feel the ice in my head
Running its hands through my bed
Not even dreaming I seem to be dead
Colours of yellow and colours of red
