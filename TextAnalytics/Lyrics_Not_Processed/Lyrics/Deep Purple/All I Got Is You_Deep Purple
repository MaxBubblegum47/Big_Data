Oh yeah, I see the way you roll your eyes
The way your purse your lips
Throw your stuff into a suitcase
Put your hands upon your hips
I'm unmoved by your evil glare
The way you toss your head
You make stupid accusations
By which time I've lost the thread
Sometimes I wonder how it is you get
To piss me off this much
I may be heavy-handed
And I lack the tender touch
You moan and groan about me staying out
And drinking with the guys
How 'bout I bring them home?
Try that one on for size
There's something awfully wrong with this deal, babe
Any fool could see it's true
Can't you understand how I feel, babe?
You've got me
But all I got is you
I guess I just don't have it in me
To keep you satisfied
To be honest with you, babe
I'm only in it for the ride
And you may never bring yourself
To take me as I am
But in case you haven't noticed
I don't give a fucking damn!
