[Verse 1]
Sometimes I sit and wonder
Sometimes I just sit
I hope you all know what you're doing
Anyway who is driving this thing

[Verse 2]
Did you know the warriors of the flat earth
Have become the tyrants of the globe
It's round about that time again
She cried it's all for one my friend

[Chorus 1]
All my dreams are forgotten
When you leave me on the shelf
I can think of nothing better
Than to sit here by myself

[Chorus 2]
Least remembered soon forgotten
Didn't matter anyway
How can I ever miss you
If you never go away

[Verse 3]
I'm amazed by the way how are you
I'm amazed how could you
It wasn't that good to start with
Anyway nothings quite that simple

[Verse 2]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus 2]
