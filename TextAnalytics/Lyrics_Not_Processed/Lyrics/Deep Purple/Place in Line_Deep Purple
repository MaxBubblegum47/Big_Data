I'm living in this line
I know my place
Could think of no way
Of edging along in a loser's race
Oh, the line was moving slowly
Day by night
Everybody's shuffling on to keep a place in the line
Place in the line
Nine long years I've been in line
Getting nowhere
There is no reason for this line
Yeah, I don't care
Oh, everybody's standing
In the burning sun
Everybody's shuffling on, keeping a place in the line
Place in the line
Don't you think we're gonna make it
Don't you think we're gonna make it
Don't you think we're gonna make it now
We've got a place in line
We're gonna make it some time somehow, yeah
Don't you think we're gonna make it
Don't you think we're gonna make it
Don't you think we're gonna make it now
We've got a place in line
We're gonna make it some time somehow, alright
