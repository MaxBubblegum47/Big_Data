Take pity on two-tone Eddie
His hair was never right
He used to be cool with a glint in his eye
But he lost it overnight
Spinning word is changeing, things are rearranging
But Eddie says to me
Nothing wrong with the way it was
That's the way it's meant to be
Up the revolution
We're all prepared to die
Up the revolution
That was the battle cry
There's going to be Hell, Hell to pay
There's going to be Hell, Hell to pay
Eddie was a die-hard rebel in the good old days
Of way back when
A cigarette was cool and all the kids in school
Could read and count to ten
Everyone said he had a future bright
Of that there was no doubt
He never could make us understand
What the rebellion was all about
Up the revolution
We're all prepared to die
Up the revolution
That was the battle cry
There's going to be Hell, yeah, Hell to pay
There's going to be Hell, Hell to pay
Two-tone Eddie drew up battle plans
For making love not war
Everybody laughed at the fighting in the streets
And behind a guarded door
It came to nothing when it all went down
And the band began to play
Another plan, put your head in the sand
Live to fight another day
Up the revolution
We're all prepared to die
Up the revolution
That was the battle cry
There's going to be Hell, Hell to pay, yeah
There's going to be Hell, Hell to pay, oh
There's going to be Hell, Hell to pay
There's going to be Hell, he he, he he he
