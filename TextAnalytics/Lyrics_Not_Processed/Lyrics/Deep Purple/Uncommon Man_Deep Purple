[Verse]
Our days fall together in time
You said you can’t have it all
Beast and the broom, I have that kind of feeling
It’s got to be twenty foot tall
But the man
Is still alive
Oh, oh, oh
It’s good to be king
Standing together again
Everyone is starting to sway
I want to hit all the clubs to the sky
Oh, it’s a fabulous day
If I’m back
It’s walk and talk
Oh, oh, oh
It’s good to be king
It’s good to be king
By the way
The carriage is waiting
To take yo away
If you let all the fear right in
We’d never betray you
Believe what you see
It’s late as enticing, drift away

[Outro]
It’s good to be king[x4]
