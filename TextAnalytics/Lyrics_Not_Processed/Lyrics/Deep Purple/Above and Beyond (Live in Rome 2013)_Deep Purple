Light up a candle
Start one for me
Let it float on the water
Right down to the sea

Draw back your curtain
Wave me goodbye
Lift up your arms
And look up to the sky
To the sky

Start me a candle
Keep it alight
Put it there in the window
And I'll come back tonight

Touch me in the darkness
I'll send you a sign
Give me your loving
And I’ll give you mine

I may be leaving
But I won’t be gone
I’ll be there when you want me
Above and beyond

Nothing I can tell you
It’s all up to you
I’ll be here if you need me
Am I getting through

Rest on your sadness
And tomorrow we'll find
That souls, having touched
Are forever entwined

I may be leaving
But I won't be gone
I’ll be there when you want me
Above and beyond

Yes, I may be leaving
But not for too long
I’ll be there when you want me
Above and beyond
