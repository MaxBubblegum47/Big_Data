[Verse]
Lucille, come back where you belong
Oh, Lucille, come back where you belong
I ain't nothing to you, sing you such a beautiful song

I woke up this morning, Lucille was not in sight
I asked her friends about her but all their lips were tight

[Outro]
Lucille, come back where you belong
I ain't nothing to you, sing you such a beautiful song
