No one sees the things you do
Because I stand in front of you
But you drive me all the time
You put the evil in my mind

I used to sing and say my prayers
Live my life without a care
Now I have become a fool
I tried to listen to the mule

How can I change when my mind
Is a friend of a Lucifer hid in the ground
Just another slave for the mule
