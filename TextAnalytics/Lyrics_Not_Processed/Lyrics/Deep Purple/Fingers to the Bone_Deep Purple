[Verse 1]
Everything went wrong
I'm sorry boys, I've got to let you go
We've had some hard times
And the long rain, it didn't show
Hired hands, I've seen them come and go
But you don't come much better
Today's Blue Monday
I just got a bad news letter

[Verse 2]
This day has come
The darkest cloud on our horizon
My hands are tied down
To that promise note I signed upon
Always been this way
It's the poor man who gets hurt
All you ever work for
Is to leave your footprints in the dirt
You work your fingers to the bone

[Verse 3]
The deed is done
The fruit will fall to someone else's hand
That's how the land lies
Now we all know where we stand
You'll have to walk away
Don't let them see you running
Today's Blue Monday
I should have seen it coming
You work your fingers to the bone

[Verse 4]
If sweat and tears were all it took
To make this valley green
We'd be alright but now it's gone
They've taken everything
They say it's just an act of God
And that's the way ill wind blows
You've got thirty days to pack your bags
Say goodbye, hit the road

[Outro]
You work your fingers to the bone
