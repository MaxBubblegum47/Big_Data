[Verse 1]
Operator, I'm looking for a girl
You've got to help me get through
I don't know much about her
So I'm relying on you
She got rhythm but no sense of timing
She likes living but she's got no address
Operator, you've got to get me out of this mess
Let me tell you about her

[Pre-Chorus]
She hasn't got a face
She hasn't got a name
She hasn't got a leg to stand upon

[Chorus]
She's out of touch but not out of mind
And I've got to see again that gypsy child
Operator, this is the call of the wild

[Verse 2]
She's a hitch-hiker, never gets a ride
But you can bet she's on time
She's always around but so hard to find
She causes trouble, she never takes offense
Dirty mind a heart of gold
Operator don't, don't you put me on hold, no

[Pre-Chorus]
She hasn't got a face
She hasn't got a name
She hasn't got a leg to stand upon

[Chorus]
She's out of touch but not out of mind
And I've got to see again that gypsy child
Operator, this is the call of the wild

[Pre-Chorus]
She hasn't got a face
She hasn't got a name
She hasn't got a leg to stand upon

[Chorus]
She's out of touch but not out of mind
And I've got to see again that gypsy child
Operator, this is the call of the wild

[Pre-Chorus]
She hasn't got a face
She hasn't got a name
She hasn't got a leg to stand upon

[Chorus]
She's out of touch, not out of mind
She hasn't got a face
She hasn't got a name
