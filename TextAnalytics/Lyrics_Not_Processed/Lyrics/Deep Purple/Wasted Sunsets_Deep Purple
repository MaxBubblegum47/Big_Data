[Verse 1]
The day is gone
When the angels come to stay
And all the silent whispers
Will be blown away
Lying in the corner
A pair of high heel shoes
Hanging on the wall
Gold and silver for the blues
One too many wasted sunsets
One too many for the road
And after dark the door is always open
Hoping someone else will show
Someone is waiting
Behind an unlocked door
Grey circles overhead
Empties on the floor
The cracks in the walls
Have grown too long
The slow hand is dragging on
Afraid to meet the dawn
One too many wasted sunsets
One too many for the road
And after dark the door is always open
Hoping someone else will show
