Oh babe
I gotta get down
If I work hard every day
For my money
If I work my fingers down to the bone
That ain't funny, oh yeah
Now if I see something I can't buy
I put a dollar down
I try, try, try to get my money
I need my money, oh yeah
A woman who ain't got a dime
I can't use her
If she ain't got no cash money
I got to refuse her, I've got to refuse her
I need a woman
With a whole lotta will
So will you help me, baby?
Help me pay my bill
I need my money, yeah
I've got to have money, yeah
I need lovin' to give me a livin'
So don't ask me, I don't need forgivin'
I will stand up to count the cost
But I know I won't stand the loss
I need a woman
With a whole lotta will
She can help me pay my bill
I need my money
I want my money
Before I say my prayers
I count my money
When I wake up
It had to be there, my money
You see, love, it don't mean a thing
When she loves you
She can't bring, can't bring you no money
I've got to have my money
Lookin' for lovin', I need a livin'
Lookin' for lovin', I need a livin'
Lookin' for lovin', I need a livin'
Lookin' for lovin', I need a livin'
Lookin' for lovin', I need a livin'
