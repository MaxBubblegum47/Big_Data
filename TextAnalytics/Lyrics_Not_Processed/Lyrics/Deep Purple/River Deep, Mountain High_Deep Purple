[Verse 1]
When you were a young girl
Did you have a rag doll
The only doll you've ever owned
Now I'll love you just the way
You loved that rag doll
Only now my love has grown

[Bridge]
It gets stronger as the river flows
Deeper baby, heaven knows
Higher, as it goes

[Chorus]
Do I love you, my oh my
River Deep, Mountain High
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Do I love you, would I cry
Oh I love you baby
How I love you baby

[Verse 2]
When you were a young girl
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around
Well I'm going to be
As faithful as that puppy
No I'll never never let you down

[Bridge]
Because it gets stronger
As the river flows
It gets deeper baby, heaven knows
It gets higher
So much higher, as it goes

[Chorus]
Do I love you, my oh my
River Deep, Mountain High
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Do I love you, would I cry
Oh I love you baby
How I love you baby

[Verse 3]
I love you baby
Like a flower loves a spring
I love you baby
Like a robin likes to sing
I love you baby
Like a schoolboy likes his pie
And oh I love you baby
River deep, mountain high

[Chorus]
Do I love you, my oh my
River Deep, Mountain High
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Do I love you, would I cry
Oh I love you baby
How I love you baby
