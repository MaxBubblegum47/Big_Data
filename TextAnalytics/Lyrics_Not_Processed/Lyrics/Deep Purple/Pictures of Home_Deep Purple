[Verse 1]
Somebody's shouting
Up at a mountain
Only my own words return
Nobody's up there
It's a deception
When will I ever learn?

[Chorus]
I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And whispering pictures of home

[Verse 2]
Wondering blindly
How can they find me?
Maybe they don't even know
My body is shaking
Anticipating
The call of the black-hooded crow

[Chorus]
I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And talking with pictures of home

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Here in this prison
Of my own making
Year after day, I have grown
Into a hero
But there's no worship
Where have they hidden my throne?

[Chorus]
I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And screaming out pictures of home

[Organ Solo]

[Bass Solo]
