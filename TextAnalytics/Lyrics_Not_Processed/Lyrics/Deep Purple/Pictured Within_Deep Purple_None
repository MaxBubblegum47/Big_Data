Here be friends...
Here be heroes...
Here be sunshine...
Here be grey...
Here be life...
Here love lies bleeding...
Memories so hazy...
And dreams that drove me crazy

Here be down...
Here be paradise...
Here be starbright...
Here be pain...
Here be smiles in eyes like rainbows...
My father and my mother...
My sisters and my brother -
Pictured within

Where there're shadows ill met by moonlight...
There are dragons I have slain...
And here be bright eyes with hair so golden...
Sunrise and sunset and running free...
And laughing at the rain

Here be home...
Here be travellin'...
Here be thunder...
Here be blue...
And Sometimes heaven and thoughts of wonder...
The Miracle of children...
A poet and a pilgrim

Kith and kin - pictured within
Lose and win - pictured within
