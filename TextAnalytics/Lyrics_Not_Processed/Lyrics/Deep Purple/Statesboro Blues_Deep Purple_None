Wake up, momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up, momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve, baby, to turn Uncle John from your door
I woke up this morning, I had them Statesboro Blues
I woke up this morning, I had them Statesboro Blues
Well, I looked over in the corner, and Grandpa seemed to have them, too
Well, my momma died and left me
My poppa died and left me
I ain’t good-looking, baby
But I’m somewhat sweet and kind
I’m going to the country, baby, do you want to go?
But if you can’t make it, baby, your sister Lucille said she want to go
(And I sure will take her)
I love that woman, better than any woman I’ve ever seen
Well, I love that woman, better than any woman I’ve ever seen
Well, now, she treat me like a king, yeah, yeah, yeah, and she look like a doggone queen
Wake up, momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up, momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve, baby, to turn Uncle John from your door
