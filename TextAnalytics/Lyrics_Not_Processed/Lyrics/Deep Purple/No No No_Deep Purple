[Verse 1]
Really hate the running
Really hate the game
Looking at them all
I wanna be unborn again
Their suit is getting tighter
Although they're getting thin
The flies are crawling on their face
And trying to get in

[Pre-Chorus]
People say that we're to blame, I say
No no no, it's just the game

[Chorus]
Must we let them fool us? No no no
Have we got our freedom? No no no
Is it getting better? No no no
Do we love each other? No no no
Must we wait forever? No no no no no

[Instrumental break 1:32-2:46]

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
Heads are getting stronger bodies getting weak
Looking at them all it feels good to be a freak
Their hands are getting closer they're reaching out so far
The greenies gonna get them make them serve stars
Tell them how it is and they say
No no no we know it all
We know it all

[Chorus]
Must we let them fool us? No no no
Have we got our freedom? No no no
Is it getting better? No no no
Do we love each other? No no no
Must we wait forever? No no no no no

[Instrumental break 4:04-5:23]

[Organ solo]

[Verse 3]
The washing's getting dirty the air is getting thin
It's all in such a mess that no one knows where to begin
They talk about creating but all they do is kill
They say we're gonna mend it but they never will
Poison in the rain but they say
No no no we ain't to blame
It ain't us

[Chorus]
Must we let them fool us? No no no
Have we got our freedom? No no no
Is it getting better? No no no
Do we love each other? No no no
Must we wait forever? No no no no no
