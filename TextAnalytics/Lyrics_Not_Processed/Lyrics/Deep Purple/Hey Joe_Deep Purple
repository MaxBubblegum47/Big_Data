[Verse 1]
Hey Joe, where you going
With that gun in your hand
Hey Joe, now tell me where you going
With that gun in your hand
I'm going to shoot my lady
Because I caught her messing
Around with another man
Yes, I'm going down to shoot my lady
Because I caught her messing
Around with another man

[Verse 2]
Hey Joe, I heard you shot
Your woman down
Hey Joe, I heard you shot
Your woman down
Right down to the ground
Yes I did I shot her
You know I shot her because I caught
Her messing around town
Yes I did I shot her
I shot my woman because
She was messing around town
I gave her the gun, I shot her!

[Verse 3]
Hey Joe, 
tell me
Where you going to run to now?
Hey Joe, come on tell me
Where you going to run to?
Don't you worry about me
I'm going way down South
Way down South
Where I'm going to be free
I'm going way down South
Way down South
Maybe outside Mexico Way
I'm going to run, oh yeah
