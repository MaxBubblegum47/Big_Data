[Verse 1]
When night time comes
And I'm ten thousand miles away
Just lose yourself
And watch the band kick back and play

[Chorus]
Get up keep in line
It's getting tighter all the time
You say, you're feeling fine
It's getting tighter all the time

[Verse 2]
Get a load off your mind
This place is right it's hard to find
The mood is set alright
It's going to be a long, long night
You keep spinning around
You find it hard to touch the ground
And time is all it takes
You'll find it easy once you make

[Chorus]
Get up, keep in line
It's getting tighter all the time
Getting tighter[x9]
