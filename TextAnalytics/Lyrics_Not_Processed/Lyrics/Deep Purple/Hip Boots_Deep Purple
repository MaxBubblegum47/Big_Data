[Verse 1]
You can bury me up to my knees in shit, yeah
Or anything else, I don't mind one bit
You think I'm gonna drown but you're wrong
'Cause man, I got my hip boots on

[Verse 2]
Get your ass in the water and swim like me
Yeah, it's the only way you're going free
If you blink an eye I'm down the road and gone
It's plain to see that I don't belong

[Chorus]
I got my hip boots on
And it's so cool
It's beautiful

[Post-Chorus]
Those rusty chains can't tie me down
'Cause man, I got my hip boots on

[Bridge]
I never give it up
Tear it up, yeah
Rip it up
I can't get enough
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
Before that shit starts going down
When I hear the dogs I go to ground
And that's me high steppin' through the swamp
Yeah, that's why I got these hip boots on

[Outro]
I got my hip boots on
And it's so cool
It's beautiful
And it's so cool
