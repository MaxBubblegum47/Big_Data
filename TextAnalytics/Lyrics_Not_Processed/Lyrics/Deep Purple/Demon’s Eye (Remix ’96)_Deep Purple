[Chorus 1]
I don't mind just what you say
I never heard you, baby, never heard you anyway

[Verse 1]
I don't care what you do
Just so long as it ain't me and you

[Chorus 2]
Sly, sly, sly like a demon's eye

[Chorus 3]
Everything's good, I said, everything's fine
You don't know, don't know it's the end of your time

[Verse 2]
How does it feel to be turned away?
I've known it, baby, almost every day

[Chorus 2]
Sly, sly, sly like a demon's eye

[Verse 3]
I don't need you anymore
I don't want you, baby, hanging round my door
You slip and slide round my brain
You think you're so clever, yeah, but you know you're insane

[Chorus 2]
Sly, sly, sly like a demon's eye

[Chorus 1]
I don't mind just what you say
I never heard you, baby, never heard you anyway

[Chorus 3]
Everything's good, I said, everything's fine
You don't know, don't know it's the end of your time

[Chorus 2]
Sly, sly, sly like a demon's eye
