Hot summer night, the working girls were on their way back home
It was getting late so I tagged along, couldn't let them walk alone
I followed them up some greasy steps to a rooftop in the sky
No walls around, just a sea of stars, my throat was getting dry
Everyone could feel the heat that's why we all disrobed
Our clothes and inhibitions went off flying 'cross the globe
Dancing crazy, getting loose and closer to the edge
I could feel my blood was up and it was pounding in my head
So there I was, just me and the girls
Under the moonlight on top of the world
Oh yeah, on top of the world
So there I was, just me and the girls
Under the moonlight on top of the world
As things were dying down we retreated from the precipice
I lay beside the most beautiful girl in the universe
Her name was Venus in Heaven
She fed me rice and offered me wine
I accepted ambrosia and nectar
From an amber goddess
I collapsed between the thighs of Morpheus
Next thing I felt was a sharp pain at sunrise
My mouth was open and full of rice
As I managed to prize open one of my eyes
I saw Luigi the cockroach carry off his prize
And there lay Venus still sprawled out and naked for sure
But not quite what she was the night before
I made my excuses and left through the door
Stepped into space at the twentieth floor
And that's why I don't like heights no more
