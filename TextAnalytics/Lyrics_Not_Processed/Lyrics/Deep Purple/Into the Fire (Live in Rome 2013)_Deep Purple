[Verse 1]
Take the trouble to decide the things you do
Will not be the things that don't appeal to you
See the mess you're making, can't you see you're faking?
Into the fire
Turn on to the mandrake that was given to you
See if you can make it like the others do

[Chorus]
Feel the blood a-knocking when you're finger popping
Into the fire

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Listen very closely to the message I've sung

[?] once or twice and stick it right up your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch

[Chorus]
Feel the blood a-knocking when you're finger popping
Into the fire
