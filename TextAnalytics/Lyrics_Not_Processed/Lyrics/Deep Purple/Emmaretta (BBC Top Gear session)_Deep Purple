Emmaretta
Did you get my letter
I sent it to you
Oh Emmaretta
Do you still feel
When night is falling
Something's calling
Oh Emmaretta

Behind my thoughts
Oh Emmaretta
I can get to you
To feel better
I must go now
Oh Emmaretta
Full moon's rising
Oh Emmaretta

Oh, it's a thousand miles
Oh, and I need you child
Oh, they can drive me wild
What I feel, make it real
