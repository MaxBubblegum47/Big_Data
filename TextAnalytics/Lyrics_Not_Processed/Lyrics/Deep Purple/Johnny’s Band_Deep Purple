Ooh, Johnny Jones woke up one day from dreaming
Told Bill the bass and soon they had a plan
He passed it on to Pete and Crazy Benny
Ah, suddenly they had a band
Hey Johnny's Band
He sure knew how to work up a crowd
The sound that they made put the rest in the shade
And the word soon got around
They played every dance hall in the city
Wrote themselves a cool forty-five
With a bullet it shot to the top of the pops
Oh man it was good to be alive
Hail Johnny's Band
Hear them on the radio
Smash after smash now they're rolling in the cash
Whatever they touch turns to gold
Poor old Benny went down with the hard stuff
And Pete joined a cult in LA
Johnny and Bill started going downhill
And the crowds began melting away
Yeah, but hey, it's Johnny's Band
Playing Saturday nights at The Crown
The beards may be long and the money's long gone
It's a wonder that they're still around
But hey, it's Johnny's Band
Playing all those wonderful songs
Making the rounds with that old fashioned sound
And here we are singing along
