[Verse 1]
Lightning flashing on heavy iron gate
Scares me to death but I just can’t wait
Deep in a dungeon there's a rattling of chains
Mad Dr. Phibes, he’s going to eat my brain

[Chorus]
It feels so good to be afraid
Vincent Price is back again

[Verse 2]
Heart pumping louder, the music's out of time
The vampire’s dying, he’s got to have wine
Red blood dripping, she doesn’t have a prayer
I know it’s not real but I just don’t care

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I want seven screaming virgins on a sacrificial altar
Howling dogs, creaking doors, and zombies to die for
