[Verse 1]
When I was younger
So much younger than today
Never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone
I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind
Opened up the door

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
But I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please help me, yeah

[Verse 2]
And now my life has changed
In, oh, so many ways
My independence seems
To vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
Now I know I need you like
I've never done before

[Chorus]
Help me if you can
I'm feeling down, down
But I do appreciate you being round me
Help me get my feet
Back on the ground
Won't you please help me, my love

[Bridge]
(Help) I need somebody
(Help) Not just anybody
(Help) I need someone
Help

[Outro]
Won't you please help me, my love
Help me, baby
Help me
