Can you remember, remember my name
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Cold spirits of ice
All my life
I am the echo of your past
I am returning the echo of a point in time
And distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
Laughing as the spirits appear
All my life
I am shadow of your day
If you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow
A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in my mind
Aching in the dead of the night
Your tears are lost in falling rain
If you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers
I don't want to taste your poison no, no
