[Verse 1]
Unforgettable face, I can't think of her name
It's on the edge of my tongue, gathering dust in the
Back of my brain
Something about the way she ignores me that's vaguely
Familiar
Makes you wonder what it was you ever did to thrill
Her

[Chorus 1]
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here I go again

[Verse 2]
I never felt the need to soothe her savage breast
She never felt obliged to tell me of her change of
Address
Caught me on a downward swing but I fell through her
Arms
How could I be so careless, I never meant to go so far

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Oh she's back in town
Oh she's back in town
I'm not leaving
I'm running away

[Verse 3]
She took it all away, now she's back for the rest
Took it all so easy, wouldn't settle for less
She doesn't know what she wants but she knows how
To get it
I can't remember the time, she never let me forget it

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
Oh Whatsername's back in town
She's back in town
I'm not leaving
I'm running away

[Chorus 2]
