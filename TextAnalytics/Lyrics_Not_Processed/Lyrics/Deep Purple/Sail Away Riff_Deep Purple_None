If you're driftin' on an empty ocean
With no wind to fill your sails
The future your horizon
It's like searchin' for the Holy Grail

You feel there's no tomorrow
As you look into the water below
There's only your reflection
And you still ain't got no place to go

Time will show
When I don't know
Sail away tomorrow
Sailin' far away
To find it, steal or borrow
I'll be there someday

Now woman, I keep returnin'
To sing the same old songs
The story's been told, now I'm gettin' old
Tell me, where do I belong?

Feels like I'm goin' to surrender
Hard times, I've had enough
If I could find a place to hide my face
I believe I could get back up

Time will show
When I don't know
Sail away tomorrow
Sailin' far away
To find it, steal or borrow
I'll be there someday
