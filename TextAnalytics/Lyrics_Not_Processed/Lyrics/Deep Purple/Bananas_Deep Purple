[Intro]
I've got nothing to say today
I used my words up yesterday

[Verse 1]
I'm just lying here in the sun
Watching you guys having fun
Seven days and seven nights
Working till you got it right
Don't help me I'll help myself
I'll pull some crackers off the shelf
She had her hair done yesterday
Now she's coming out to play
First you pull and then you push
Two in the hand and one in the bush

[Chorus]
Oh, my love is
So excited
When I say we've
Been invited
Now we're going
To the palace
Dressing up for
Tea with Alice

[Verse 2]
Some will rise and some will fall
Some will come to nothing at all
The strangest people have the power
To lead me to my darkest hour
How can you be sure it's me
When it's payment on delivery

[Chorus]
Oh, my love is
So excited
When I say we've
Been invited
Now we're going
To the palace
Dressing up for
Tea with Alice
Now my love is
Richer than rich
'Cause I studied
Mathematics
Graduated
Without honours
Everyone has
Gone Bananas
