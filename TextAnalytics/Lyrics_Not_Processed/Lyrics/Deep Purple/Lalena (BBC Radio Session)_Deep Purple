When the sun goes to bed
That's the time you raise your head
That's your lot in life Lalena
Can't blame ya, Lalena

Arty tart, la de da
Can your heart get much sadder
That's your lot in life Lalena
Can't blame ya, oh Lalena

Run your hands through your hair
Paint your face with despaire
That's your lot in life Lalena
Can't blame ya, oh Lalena

When the sun goes to bed
That's the time you raise your head
That's your lot in life Lalena
I can't blame ya, oh Lalena

Arty tart, oh so la de da
Can your heart ever get much sadder
That's your lot in life Lalena
I can't blame ya, oh Lalena

Lalena, I can't blame ya Lalena
