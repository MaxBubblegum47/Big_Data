Step by step
Rattle through the night
Don't look now
There's no end in sight
Step by step
Moving on through the graveyard shift
No way out
That's the truth 'bout the size of it
Inch by inch
Shuffle through the heat
Stay in time
Don't you miss a beat
Inch by inch
Stay in line, never dance alone
Stand close
Holding on to a bag of bones
Worming your way into my life
Little by little, we're getting too tight
Taking me over and stealing my soul
Oh, oh, stealing my soul
Step by step
Step by step
