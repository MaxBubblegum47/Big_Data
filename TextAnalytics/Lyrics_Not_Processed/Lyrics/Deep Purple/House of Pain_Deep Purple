[Verse 1]
Have you ever had a woman that could make you crazy
Have you ever had a woman that could drive you mad
Have you ever had a woman give you so much trouble
And the best loving you ever had

[Chorus]
My friends all say I'm losing it big time
But I know where I've got to go
I'm going back there again
I'm going back there again
I'm going back there again
Back to the house of pain

[Verse 2]
Have you ever had a rock that just keeps on rolling
Have you ever seen a train coming down the track
Have you ever jumped into the cold, cold never
And know there's no turning back

[Chorus]
My friends all say I'm crazy, baby
But I know where I've got to go
I'm going back there again
I'm going back there again
I'm going home
Back to the house of pain

[Verse 3]
Have you ever had a weight that was much too heavy
Have you ever had a burden that was yours alone
Have you ever spent a night when you keep on waiting
Staring at the telephone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You'll always be my inspiration
I love you from afar
