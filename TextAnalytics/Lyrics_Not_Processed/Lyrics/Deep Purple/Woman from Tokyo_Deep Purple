[Verse 1]
Fly into the rising sun
Faces, smiling everyone
Yeah, she is a whole new tradition
I feel it in my heart

[Chorus]
My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

[Verse 2]
Talk about her like a Queen
Dancing in a Eastern Dream
Yeah, she makes me feel like a river
That carries me away

[Chorus]
My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me
But I'm at home and I just don't belong

[Verse 3]
So far away from the garden we love
She is what moves in the soul of a dove
Soon I shall see just how black was my night
When we're alone in Her City of light

[Verse 4]
Rising from the neon gloom
Shining like a crazy moon
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire
I get high

[Chorus]
My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo
