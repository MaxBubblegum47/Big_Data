[David Coverdale & Glenn Hughes]
You keep on moving
Far away, far away
You keep on moving
Far away, far away
Everyday wheels are turning
And the cry still returning

[

, both]
Dawn will soon be breaking
The day has just begun
You put your arms around me
Like a circle around the sun
Dance across the seasons
To a place that no one knows
Where angels fear to tread
