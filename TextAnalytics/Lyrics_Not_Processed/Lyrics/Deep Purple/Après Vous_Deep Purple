[Verse 1]
Should’ve been there to start the game
To witness why I was in
Me still the usual bow, got the awesome right ahead
Well that’s just to bring, you understand the prospect of our mission
Nothing could possibly go alright til we lost out inhibition

[Chorus]
Then we hit the lights
Maybe we should bring the girl that is
There’s nothing about it
Another world
While you go ahead, I’ll clench my thirst
Après vous, so go first

[Verse 2]
Things got new since we tend to do
We’ll liquefy the future
We just played our skills in romance
In the art of self-delusion
We went from chosen few, our confidence grew
It depends on where you’re standing
It’s not much you think
It’s only a blink between takeoff and landing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Uh, come on man
Feel the boot turn
If it’s a burst, so what can you do?
Yes I know that she wants me too
But I can’t jump the queue so après vous

[Outro]
While you go ahead, I’ll clench my thirst
Après vous!
