[Pre-Chorus]
Vibrant flashes in my mind
Remind me of a foregone time
Blackened faces, broken romance
Blackened faces

[Chorus]
My broken heart has bled
With memories of a love that's dead
Sometimes happy then sad
I need love, love help me

[Verse 1]
Passing by the grounds of time
Memories that are only mine
Looking for love, a brand new love
Looking for love
Dreams that are hard to see
Finding a new love for me
Someday she must come along
I need love, love help me

[Bridge]
I need love to come home
Somewhere there must be one

[Verse 2]
Hoping someday for good news
Waiting for that girl to choose
Only hoping, all I can do
Only hoping
One day she must come along
A girl as pretty as a song
A woman just there for me
I need love, love help me

[Pre-Chorus]
Vibrant flashes in my mind
Remind me of a foregone time
Blackened faces, broken romance
Blackened face

[Chorus]
My broken heart has bled
With memories of a love that's dead
Sometimes happy then sad
I need love, love help me
