You can't get me down
I got the 'Things are looking up' blues
I know it happens
But it never sticks to my shoes
It's been a long time coming
I never thought it would last
I think about the future
Who knows what might have happened in the past
Nothing is real
But it feels pretty good all the same
I know you from somewhere
But I can't remember your name
I don't need much space
But you don't have to step on my toes
I was looking over there
And all the time it was under my nose
Yeah, I should have known
Which way the wind was blowin'
I was facing the wrong way
Always taking the long way round
Never looking the right way
Always going the wrong way
Always taking the long way round
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Never looking the right way
Always going the wrong way
Always taking the long way round
You can reel me in slowly and surely
But there's a catch to this deal
It's not over yet
I get one more spin of the wheel
I promised myself
I would not get trashed again
But the way I'm feeling right now
That promise is going down the drain, yeah
I, I should have known
You were coming and I was gone
I was facing the wrong way
Always taking the long way round
