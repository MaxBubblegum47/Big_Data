Oh nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car
It's gonna break the speed of sound

Oh it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power
Big fat tyres and everything
I love it and I need it, I bleed it
Yeah it's a wild hurricane
Alright hold tight, I'm a highway star

Nobody gonna take my girl
I'm gonna keep her to the end
Nobody gonna have my girl
She stays close on every bend

Oh she's a killing machine
She's got everything
A moving mouth
Body control and everything
I love her an' I need her, I seed her
Yeah she turns me on
Alright hold tight, I'm a highway star

Nobody gonna take my head
I got speed inside my brain
Nobody gonna steal my head
Now that I'm on the road again

Oh I'm in heaven again
I've got everything
Like a moving ground
An open road and everything
I love it and I need it, I seed it
Eight cylinders all mine
Alright hold tight, I'm a highway star

Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car
It's gonna break the speed of sound

Oh it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power
Big fat tyres and everything
I love it and I need it, I bleed it
Yeah it's a mad hurricane
Alright hold tight, I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
