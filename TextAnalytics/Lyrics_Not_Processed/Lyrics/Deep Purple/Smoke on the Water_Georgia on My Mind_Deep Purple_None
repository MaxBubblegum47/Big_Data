We all came out to Montreaux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, the fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky & Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water,the fire in the sky
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Makin' our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, we'll never forget
Smoke on the water,the fire in the sky
Smoke on the water, the fire in the sky
GEORGIA:
Georgia, Georgia, just smile and ease my pain
An old sweet song
Georgia on my mind
Georgia, Georgia, just smile...
An old sweet song, baby
Georgia on my mind
(I love you baby, I love you so )
Or...
(You know what I'm talking about)
