Lately when my demons drag the night across my eyes
I just can't seem to fight it any more
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world
But it seems that I have heard that song before
And the voices begin to sing
Come home
I have seen some evil as I've walked upon the earth
But this is way beyond what eyes can see
Wicked is as wicked does and if I lose control
Is this the way that hell is going to be?
Have I fallen too far to rise?
Been burning too long in the fire?
Then it all falls down
Tearing the night away
It must be fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Now before my demons roll the night across my eyes
I tremble as I wait perhaps to sin
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world
And all I do is let the beast come in
Have I fallen too far to rise?
I've been standing too long in the fire
Let it all fall down
Tearing the night away
It must be fever dreams
From the outside
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
