[Verse 1]
Roll me over slowly, I've been drinking all night
Help me, make a move, I can't stand the light
Wake me, shake me, don't slam the door
I haven't been so bad, I just can't recall

[Chorus]
Spent the night chasing up a listed old flame
Lying on the floor, I can't remember her name
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here
What's going on here?

[Verse 2]
Went downtown, had a long way to go
How I got there, well I don't know
Found myself sitting in a West side bar
Tried to leave but I could not go far
High class woman trying to give me a line
Should've left early when I felt so fine
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here
What's going on here?

[Instrumental Break 1:56-3:42]
When they closed up the bar
You know, they left me for dead
"I can't remember a thing", I said
Must have called the police to take me away
They said, "Forty days", now I've got to pay

[Chorus]
Spent the night chasing up a listed old flame
Lying on the floor, I can't remember my name
I can't get together while they're messing with me

[Outro]
Keep on looking around, tell me where can I be?
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here
What's going on here?
