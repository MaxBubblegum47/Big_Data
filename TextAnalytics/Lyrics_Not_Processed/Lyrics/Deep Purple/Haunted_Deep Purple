[Verse 1]
I hear the beating of your wings
And you're playing on my strings
In mysterious ways
You draw me in
To a love
Beyond all understanding
Beyond my reach
So far away
But it seems
Like only yesterday

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm Haunted
Haunted
Is that what you wanted

[Chorus]
All that's left
Is the ghost of your smile
It stays awhile
Then fades away

[Verse 2]
I hear your footsteps on the ground
Tempting me to turn around
It's just the echo
Of a disenchanted lover
Shuffling aimlessly
Homeward bound
To empty rooms
And picture frames
And Friends
Who can't recall our names

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
