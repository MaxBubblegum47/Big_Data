She came home last night, rockin' rollin' drunk
She talk no sense but she sound good so she thunk
So I reached over and said "Hello
Is there some planet you'd care to go?"
And she said "Venus on the rocks"
So I said
She got a mean streak
Black mamba, no compete
She got a mean streak
Temptation, bitter sweet
She drive me crazy, gets inside my brain
She spend my money down the drain, oh
So I roll over for my reward
"How much can I afford?"
And she says "Just a little more"
You know
She got a mean streak
Black mamba, no compete
She got a mean streak
Temptation, bitter sweet
She got a mean streak
Black mamba, no compete
She got a mean streak
Temptation, bitter sweet
I can't take this no more
I tried so hard but I can't get through the door
'Cause one smile from those eyes
And I stand there paralysed
And she says "You better beg for more
I mean, get down sucker, you know what I like"
Ooh, hang on
Black mamba don't compete
She got a mean streak
Temptation, bitter sweet
She got a mean streak
Black mamba don't compete
She got a mean streak
Temptation, bitter sweet
Mean streak, ooh
Mean streak
She got a mean streak, ah, ooh, ooh
She got a mean streak
Let me tell ya
Mean streak
Oh, oh, oh, mean streak
Mean streak
She got a mean streak
