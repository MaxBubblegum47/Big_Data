[Verse 1]
Broken down relations, beaten up guitars
Making one last appearance in a heap of old cars
Brambles and weeds flourishing amongst
Lines of empty bottles and rambling drunks

[Chorus]
Junkyard blues sound familiar
I'm never alone
Always remind me of home

[Verse 2]
One of a dozen covered with stains
Blistered and stinking was all that remained
Cannibalised machines, mysterious bones
Unwanted contents of anonymous homes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Mangy old dog scratching in the dust
Burned out Mercedes surrendering to rust
All this stuff was good for something
But here it is now, good for nothing

[Chorus]
