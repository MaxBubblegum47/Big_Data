[Verse 1]
The golden light about you
Show me where you're from
The magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon
You stand up on your hill, bebop all around you
They wonder where you're from, oh yeah
They wonder where I found you

[Chorus]
Oh my love, it's a long way
Where you're from, it's a long way

[Verse 2]
I tried to understand you, I tried to love you right
The way you smile and touch me always sets my heart alight
Your lips are like a fire burning through my soul
And people ask me where you're from
They really wanna know

[Chorus]
Oh my love, it's a long way
Where you're from, it's a long way

[Verse 3]
Magic woman wrecking up my soul
Things you tell me have never been told
Magic woman who I don't know
Electric before me, I love you so, I love you so
You're racing like a fireball, dancing like a ghost
You're Gemini and I don't know which one I like the most
My head is getting broken
My mind is getting bust and
I'm coming with you down the road of golden dust

[Chorus]
Oh my love, it's a long way
Where you're from, it's a long way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
The golden light about you show me
Where you're from
The magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon
You stand up on your hill, bebop all around you
They wonder where you're from, oh yeah
They wonder where I found you

[Chorus]
Oh my love, it's a long way
Where you're from, it's a long, long way

[Instrumental Outro]
