[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Saying that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-see 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no looking back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling, "Too soon!
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
Ature on the subject; you sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty, we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry, hurry, go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp, remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Ayy, keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part, play your part"

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
(Sweet Jones)
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with forty dollars in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch, it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, I choose you girl, yeah

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Baby, you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl, I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile (mile)
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
'Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable (fable)
We rocking Russian sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
'Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes?
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, I choose you girl, yeah

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick, or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit', girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
'Cause it's gonna get wetter, better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby, but we see she don't
Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it
Slaughter-slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
'Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
'Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up (shit)

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, I choose you girl, yeah
Ahh, I choose you baby...
