[Verse 1]
I was born in a town full of red pine trees
County sign says "follow your dreams"
Westbound train makes the whole town shake
Friday night lights decide your fate

[Verse 2]
Born again in a church where the steeple's white
Preacher preach Book of John and my momma cried
Meaning of life was in verse 2
Didn't make sense 'til I found you

[Chorus]
I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you

[Verse 2]
I was a wild child between lost and found
Then you spoke my name, it was a sweet sound
Rescue kiss and you pulled me in
All my life baby, where you been

[Chorus]
'Cause I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you

[Chorus]
'Cause I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
