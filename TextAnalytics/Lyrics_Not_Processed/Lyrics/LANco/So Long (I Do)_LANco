[Verse 1]
Now every single summer on the fourth of July
Thinking about you baby and I don't know why
But I do, oooh, I do
Seeing fireworks dancing up in the air
And I think about the ocean and your salty hair
I do, oooh, I do
If I see you in a bar and I ask you to dance
Will you remember our little summer romance
'Cause I do, oooh, I do

[Chorus]
'Cause it was one night, it was one chance
When the morning sun came up over the sand
So long, you were gone
You can get your number, don't know where I'm from
But if you're out there tonight, I hope you still dream wrong
I do, oooh, I do

[Verse 2]
And when you get a little buzz and lay under the stars
Do you still think about us small
We all, we all look up at the sky
No longer you and I
No matter how far apart we are
We are, we are, we are, we are

[Chorus]
'Cause it was one night, it was one chance
When the morning sun came up over the sand
So long, you were gone
So long, so long, so long

[Chorus]
It was one night, it was one chance
When the morning sun came up, came up
It was one night, it was one chance
When the morning sun came up over the sand
So long

[Outro]
And I probably won't ever see you again
But I'll always dream of taking your hand
And saying I do, oooh, I do
