[Verse 1]
It's a sundown situation
Can't you feel the anticipation
Like the calm before the storm
Can't say now that we ain't been warned
It's been a while since I've seen your smile
Light up the night like the fireflies
Honey, we're too young to be sitting somewhere, doing nothing
Let's get out there while we're still young and wild

[Chorus]
These are the hallelujah nights
These are the best days of our life
The ones we won't get back
The ones that go too fast
The ones that make you feel like heaven might be right next to ya
Throw your hands up, hallelujah
These hallelujah nights

[Verse 2]
I can hear tomorrow calling
But you and me and the stars are falling
The night is young and 'till it's done
Love feels better when it's on the run
While we're still young and wild

[Chorus]
These are the hallelujah nights
These are the best days of our life
The ones we won't get back
The ones that go too fast
The ones that make you feel like heaven might be right next to ya
Throw your hands up, hallelujah
These hallelujah nights

[Bridge]
Come on, come on
Hang on to that feeling
You never know when you're gonna feel it again

[Chorus]
These are the hallelujah nights
These are the best days of our life
The ones we won't get back
The ones that go too fast
The ones that make you feel like heaven might be right next to ya
Throw your hands up, hallelujah
These hallelujah nights

[Outro]
These hallelujah
These hallelujah nights
These hallelujah nights
These hallelujah
