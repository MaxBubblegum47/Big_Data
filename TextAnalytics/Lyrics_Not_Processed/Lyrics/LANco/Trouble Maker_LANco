[Verse 1]
She got a little more wiggle in her walkin'
The boys shut up and the girls start talkin'
Candy red lipstick, wild cherry flavor
Hottie here to party and you know I ain't a hater
(1, 2, 3, 4, there she goes on the floor)

[Chorus]
Yeah, she's a hip shaker
Heart breaker, trouble maker
Woo hoo, I'll take her

[Verse 2]
When her song comes on, she's a main attraction
Every guy can't help but want in on the action
You got your wannabes and you got your players
I'm just a guy who appreciates what her mama gave her
(1, 2, 3, 4, work that booty on the floor) work it

[Chorus]
Yeah, she's a hip shaker
Heart breaker, trouble maker
Woo hoo, I'll take her

[Post-Chorus]
Get down, turn around
Stomp them boots, on the ground

[Verse 3]
Some guys got a line, some guys buy a drink
Some guys make a move, some guys just think about it
I'm in the band, thought that would get her
But she left with her girlfriends, should've known better

(1, 2, 3, 4, there she goes out the door)

[Chorus]
Yeah, she's a hip shaker
Heart breaker, trouble maker
Woo hoo
Yeah, she's a hip shaker
Heart breaker, trouble maker
Woo ah, forget her
