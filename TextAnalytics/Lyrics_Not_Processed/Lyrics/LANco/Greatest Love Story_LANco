[Verse 1]
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

[Outro]
We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me
