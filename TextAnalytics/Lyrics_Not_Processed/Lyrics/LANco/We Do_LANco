[Verse 1]
Drinking on the weekend, dollar PBR
And I dont got my keys so I can't go far
But I really don't have another place to go
This is all I need and it's all I know
I got my friends all around, my hand on my girl
I really don't care about the rest of the world
We are doing things our way tonight
And if you don't approve, that's alright

[Chorus]
This is our life, love it or hate it
People may not appreciate it
We do, we do
This is our town, love it or leave it
We got it made, if you don't see it
We do, we do

[Verse 2]
Someday we'll have real jobs and we'll probably have kids
We probably won't tell them all the things we did
But we'll make it in the future some way, some how
But we're living in the moment, in the here and now
We don't got alot of gas, we don't got alot of money
But we got alot of jokes and we always think we're funny
It's the simple things that keep us going
It's the simple things that keep us knowing

[Chorus]
This is our life, love it or hate it
People may not appreciate it
We do, we do
This is our town, love it or leave it
We got it made, if you don't see it
We do, we do

[Bridge]
We don't have alot but we make the most of everything we've got
So let's raise a toast
Here's to all the friends that we'll never forget
And here's to all the times that we'll never regret

[Chorus]
'Cause this is our life, love it or hate it
People may not appreciate it
We do, we do
This is our town, love it or leave it
We got it made, if you don't see it
We do, we do

[Chorus]
And this is our life, love it or hate it
People may not appreciate it
But we do, we do
And this is our town, love it or leave it
We got it made, if you don't see it now
We do, we do

[Outro]
We do, we do
We do, we do
