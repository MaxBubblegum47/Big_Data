[Verse 1]
Baby you look so good
Sitting on the car hood
I got a front row seat to the best show
Freeze frame, memory made
No money, no plans
But I know we can
Find a little spot where we don't need that
Yeah, I know, you know where it's at

[Chorus]
You and me, singin' at the stars
Moving real slow, falling real hard
I wouldn't wanna be anyone
But who we are, who we are
We could stay all night or a whole lot longer
Kiss me like that and I'm a goner
It's a sweet song and I know it by heart
It's you and me, singin' at the stars

[Verse 2]
Slow dancing in the clovers
Over and over
Hands on my shoulders, couldn't be closer
And the radio ain't even on
You in the moonlight couldn't be more right
I lose all track of time but I don't mind
If we dance until the dawn

[Chorus]
You and me, singin' at the stars
Moving real slow, falling real hard
I wouldn't wanna be anyone
But who we are, who we are
We could stay all night or a whole lot longer
Kiss me like that and I'm a goner
It's a sweet song and I know it by heart
It's you and me, singin' at the stars
Singin' at the stars
Singin' at the stars

[Bridge]
Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh
Singin' at the stars

[Chorus]
You and me, singin' at the stars
Moving real slow, falling real hard
I wouldn't wanna be anyone
But who we are, who we are
We could stay all night or for a whole lot longer
Kiss me like that and I'm a goner
It's a sweet song and I know it by heart
It's you and me, singin' at the stars
Singin' at the stars

[Outro]
Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh
