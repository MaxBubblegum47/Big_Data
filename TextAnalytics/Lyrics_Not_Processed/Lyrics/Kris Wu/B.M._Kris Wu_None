[Verse 1]
E.S.T 5.6
We been on it ever since
The London bridge didn't fall on this
Cuz the shit we wear was too flame
Never miss designed for sure cultured
The minds of greats un-altered
Define the rights dream about skies
Paint a perfect montage on summer nights
Trenched down head to toe
Laced out high to low
Parfumed yea you know
Cosmetics for the show
Check the tape, operator
This pattern needs to co-operate
Too flex on haymaker i’m tailor made punctuate
Yea i’m tailor made Burberry made

[Chorus]
Flex on ya yay yay

High fashion ain’t cheat
Draped down to my feet
Flex on ya yay yay
I’m Burberry made
High fashion ain’t cheat
Draped down to my feet

[Verse 2]
Cameras flashing’
Lights, action
No collaboration
No elaboration
Walkway that’s always my stage
I’m the king check yo queen

Shades on days, yea
Askin’ my name yea
Fly as hell on nights got game, yea
Clean cut, two tone, we moving’ on
Lean on, red zone, we moving’ on
No doubt, lights out, till the dawn
Night in, night out, Dom Perignon
Yea uh jump in my rolls

Yea uh i just might buy you a rose
