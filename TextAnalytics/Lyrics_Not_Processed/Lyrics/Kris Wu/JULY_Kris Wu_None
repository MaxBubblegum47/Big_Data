[Verse 1]
I've been looking for a reason
To have you in my arms
Where you wanna be
Never had a woman so good
Glad to have you right where you wanna be

[Pre-Chorus]
Talking 'til the morning we don't need any sleep
I hate it when you go to work
Laying 'til the sun down it feel like a dream
I hate it when we go to work
You should be here

[Chorus]
Baby, Baby, I
Doing what feels right
Baby, Baby, now
Tell me what you wanna say
Show me how you feeling, babe
Show me how you feeling, babe

[Verse 2]
You've been looking for a reason
To have me in your arms
Where I wanna be
Give you what you need and no more
Glad to have you right
Where you wanna be

[Pre-Chorus]
Talking 'til the morning we don't need any sleep
I hate it when you go to work
Laying 'til the sun down it feel like a dream
I hate it when we go to work
You should be here

[Chorus]
Baby, Baby, I
Doing what feels right
Baby, Baby, now
Tell me what you wanna say
Show me how you feeling, babe

[Verse 3]
You know this ain't rocket science
Get what you got coming to ya
I know what you like
You know that I'mma keep it coming uh
Something 'bout this Moët got you in the mood
Say you got a situation
Tell that other guy to move

Easy, I may have to call in work, girl
How I’m (s')posed to lay this work, girl
This shit way too good to function
I’m like Jordan when it’s crunch time
We at Nobu when it’s lunch time
I’mma get up out your way, girl
But only if we spending some time, sometimes

[Chorus]
Baby, Baby, I
Doing what feels right
Baby, Baby, now
Tell me what you wanna say
Show me how you feeling, babe

[Outro]
Show me how you
Show me how you feeling, babe
Show me how you feeling, babe
