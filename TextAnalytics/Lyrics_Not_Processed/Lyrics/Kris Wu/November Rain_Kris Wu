[Intro]
Murda on the beat, so it's not nice

[Chorus]
November rain just made me feel so lonely
Suicide when I can't see my shawty
Know they try but they can't be my shawty
'Cause I fall for you at these times
Hey, that's how it had to be, I'm sorry
Tryin' to put the blame on me, nah sorry
You know you can never be my shawty
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, I'm a savage  (ay)
I'm a sad boy, I'm a sad boy, and you know why
I'm a good guy turned bad guy when I crossed the line
Got new money, my old friends left them behind
Why do I fall for your type?

[Verse 1]
Say a prayer for the flow, man, goddamn
Got a place? goddamn
I can never ever hate, don't know about them
Got my haters asking, "God please, why him?"
Put in too much work to worry about them
Everything 'round me new, but my friends
'Cause I fall for you at these times

[Chorus]
November rain just made me feel so lonely
Suicide when I can't see my shawty
Know they've tried but they can't be my shawty
'Cause I fall for you at these times
Hey, that's how it had to be, I'm sorry
Tryin' to put the blame on me, nah sorry
You know you can never be my shawty
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, I'm a savage (ay)
I'm a sad boy, I'm a sad boy, and you know why
I'm a bad guy, no good guy, I crossed the line
Same old money's my new friend, I'm on my grind
Why do I fall for your type?

[Verse 2]
Tryin' to be who I'm supposed to be
Feelin' all this heat
Sometimes I'd rather not speak
And I think I'd rather just sleep
All these feelings in my head, I'm so gone
Sometimes I write it out like I don't know y'all
'Cause I put in too much work to worry about them
Everything that goes up comes to an end (yeah)
'Cause I fall for you at these times

[Chorus]
November rain just made me feel so lonely
Suicide when I can't see my shawty
Know they've tried but they can't be my shawty
'Cause I fall for you at these times
Hey, that's how it had to be, I'm sorry
Tryin' to put the blame on me, nah sorry
You know you can never be my shawty
I'm savage, I'm savage, I'm a savage (ay)

[Outro]
Savage, I'm a savage
I'm a savage, I'm a savage, I'm a savage (ay)
