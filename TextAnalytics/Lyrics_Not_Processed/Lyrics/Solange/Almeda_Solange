Hol' up

[Verse 1: Solange]
Pour my drank, drank
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
Pull that Lac on 'em
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip
Brown liquor, brown liquor
Brown skin, brown face
Brown leather, brown sugar
Brown leaves, brown keys
Brown creepers, brown face
Black skin, black braids
Black waves, black days
Black baes, black things
These are black-owned things
Black faith still can't be washed away
Not even in that Florida water
Not even in that Florida water
In that Florida water
So pour more drank
Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip, sip

Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip

We just sittin' here high, comin' down
