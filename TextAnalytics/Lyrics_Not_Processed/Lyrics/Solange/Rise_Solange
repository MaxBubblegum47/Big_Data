[Chorus 1]
Fall in your ways, so you can crumble
Fall in your ways, so you can sleep at night
Fall in your ways, so you can wake up and rise

[Chorus 1]
Fall in your ways, so you can crumble
Fall in your ways, so you can sleep at night
Fall in your ways, so you can wake up and rise

[Chorus 1]
Fall in your ways, so you can crumble
Fall in your ways, so you can sleep at night
Fall in your ways, so you can wake up and rise

[Chorus 2]
Walk in your ways, so you won't crumble
(so you won't crumble)
Walk in your ways, so you can sleep at night
Walk in your ways, so you will wake up and rise
