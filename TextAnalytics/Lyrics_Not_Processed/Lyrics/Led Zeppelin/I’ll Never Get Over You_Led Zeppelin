I'll never get over you
No I'll never get over you
I just can't ( ? )
( ? ) see her anymore
Whoah no no
It wasn't so long ago
That you told me you love me so
Then you went and said goodbye
And found another guy
I, i, i, i
I know someday
Somewhere I'll find
One love to take your place
One love to take your place
But in the meantime
I'll never get over you
No I'll never get over you
I just can't ( ? )
( ? ) see her anymore
Whoah no no
