Okay, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Ohhhh, yeah
It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh baby, let me get it back, let me get back
Let me get back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yes it has

[Verse 2]
It's been [?] a while since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just don't work right
Ooh baby, open your arms, open your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Ha!

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
It's been quite a while since the book of love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Ooh, baby, carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Sure has

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ah, rock it fuckin'
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
