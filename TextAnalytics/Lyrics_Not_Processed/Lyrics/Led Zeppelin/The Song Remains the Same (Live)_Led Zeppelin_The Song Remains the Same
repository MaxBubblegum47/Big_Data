This is called "The Song Remains The Same"

[Verse 1]
I had a dream, oh now
Crazy dream, ohh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song
People won't ya listen now?
Sing along, yeah
You don't know what you're missin' now
Any little song that ya know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it always grows
Push, push, yeah, ahhhohhhuhh

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright
The song remains the same
Ooooooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
A-ooh yeah

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
A-do it, do it, do it, do it
A-push, push, a-push

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Sing out Hare Hare
Dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights oh so bright
As we go slidin', slidin'
Slidin', slidin'
Slidin', slidin'
Slidin', slidin'
Slidin'...

Ohhh here we go
Push, push, push, push, push
Ahhhhhhhhh
