Here's one off the new album, its called The Ocean

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Singing in the sunshine, a-laughing in the rain
Rocking on the moonshine, rolling in the grain
Got no time to pack my bag, my foot's outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late for the hell high haillas ball

Ah ah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for me and play for free,I play a whole lot more
Sing 'bout good things and the sun that lights the day
And you can sing of the mountains, has the ocean lost it's way, I don't know

Ooh, yeah

[Bridge]
Na na na na na na la, la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la

[Verse 3]
Sitting around singing songs 'til the night turns into day
Used to sing on the mountains but the mountains washed away
'ow I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old, it's a real fine way to start
That's a fact, oooh yeah
Sho' fine

I just don't know, oh-oh-oh
I just don't know, oh-oh-oh
Oh, yeah

I just, I just, I just I don't know
I should-a just, I don't know
Ohh-oh-oh oh
Oh, its so good
Yeah

I don't know, oh
Oh
Oh-oh
Oh
