This is called "No  Quarter"

[Verse 1]
Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight, ohhoohohoh
The snow falls hard an' don't you know
The winds of Thor are blowin' cold cold cold col col col...
They're wearin' steel that's bright an' true oh, oh, oh, oh
To build a dream for me an' you ah-hahhhh

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter, oh hoh
They ask, they ask no quarter, whoah yeah, whoa yeah, ohhhhh

[Keyboard Solo]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Walkin' side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howlin' more more more more more...
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me an' you ahhhh yes they do

[Chorus]
A-they choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask
They ask
They ask
They ask no quarter

Oh what misery without quarter
Oh the pain, the pain without quarter, oh-oh-oh
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ahh give me quarter, quarter, quarter
Oh give me...
