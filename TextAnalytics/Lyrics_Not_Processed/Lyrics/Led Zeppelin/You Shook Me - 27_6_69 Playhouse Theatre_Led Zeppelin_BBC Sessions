[Chorus]
I said you shook me
You shook me all night long
I said you shook me
You shook me all night long
You shook me so hard baby
Baby, baby, please come home

[Verse 1]
I have a bird that whistles
And I have birds that sing, I ain't kiddin' you, no
I have a bird that whistles
And I have birds that sing
I have a bird, won't do nothing, oh
I said I buy a diamond ring

[Chorus]
You know you roll me, baby
Just like a world gone wrong
I said you roll me, baby
Just like a world, oh, in George
I don't mind that you roll me, baby
Baby, you don't, you don't know how I feel

[Chorus]
You shook me, baby, yeah
You shook me all night long
Shook me babe
You shook me all night long, long, long, oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
I said you shook me so hard, baby

[Outro]
Baby
Ahah, ba-baby
You sh-sh
You shook me ah-ooh ah-ooh ah-ooh ah-ooh ah-ooh all night
Ma ma ma ma
I told you what you do, you shook me
