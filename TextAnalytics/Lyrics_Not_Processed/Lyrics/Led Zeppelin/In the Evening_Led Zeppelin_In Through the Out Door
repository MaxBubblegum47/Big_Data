[Verse 1]
In the evening
When the day is done
I'm looking for a woman
But the girl don't come
So don't let her
Play you for a fool
She don't show no pity baby
She don't make no rules

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I just got to have

[Verse 2]
So don't you let her
Oh, get under your skin
It's only bad luck and trouble
From the day that you begin
I hear you crying in the darkness
Don't ask nobody's help
Ain't no pockets full of mercy baby
Because you can only blame yourself

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I got to have

[Verse 3]
Oh it's simple
All the pain that you go through
You can turn away from fortune, fortune
Because that's all that's left to you
It's lonely at the bottom
Man, it's dizzy at the top
But if you're standing in the middle
Ain't no way you're gonna stop

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
I got to have

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Oh whatever
That your days may bring
No use hiding in a corner
Because that won't change a thing
If you're dancing in the doldrums
One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
When you're the master of the off-chance
When you don't expect a lot

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I got to have, I got to have
I got to have your love
I got to have
Babe, I got to have your love
I got to have your love
Just got to
