[Verse 1]
You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around
And she said, don't you want it?
Don't you want cocaine, cocaine, cocaine?
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to
Try it, fry it, na na na na yeah

[Verse 2]
Heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned
Oh, oh, babe, damned
Down in the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground
Oh, hello underground
Wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said, didn't mean to
Did not mean to f-fail
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it

[Verse 3]
You want do it, you want to
You want do it when you want to
You want do it, do it when you want to
When you blow it, babe
You got to blow it right
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama
Baby, fake with all your might
When you fake it, mama
Please fake it right for yourself, babe
When you fake it, baby
You're faking it for your life, for your life
For your life, for your life
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Oh, I can have you, baby
But I don't know what to do, yeah
Sometime, baby, nothing I could do
On the balance of a crystal
Paying through the nose
And when they couldn't resist you
I thought you'd go with the flow
And now your stage is empty
Bring down the curtain, baby please
Fold up your show
Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it
I over-ran it, frying
For your life, for your life
