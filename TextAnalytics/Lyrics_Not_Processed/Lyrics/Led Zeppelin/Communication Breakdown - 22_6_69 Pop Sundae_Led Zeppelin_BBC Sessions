[Verse 1]
Hey girl, a-stop what you're doin'
Hey girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you that I like so much
Won't you let me hold you, let me feel you lovin' charms

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
Having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane, oh

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, I got something you ought to know
I wanna tell you baby, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah
Oh, I'll let you go
'Cause I like your charms

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
Having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

[Bridge]
Oh, ma ma ma babe

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
Having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

[Outro]
Do do do do do
It's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all good
I don't know much, just a little bit
I can't take all of it, babe, I just wanna do it
Give it to a-give it to me
Squeeze my lemon, just a little bit
Squeeze my lemon, just a little bit
Oh yeah
I don't want
I don't want no communication breakdown
Oh oh, yeah
Oh, my my babe
Come on
I can't stop it
