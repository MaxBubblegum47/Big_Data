Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ha ha
Why'd you change that there
Leave you baby, ah
I can't stop this feeling
How many more times
Treat me the way you wanna do
How many more times
Treat me the way you wanna do
I can't be with you baby
Please, please, Lord, be true
I'll give you all I've got to give
Rings, rings, ring-ring rings, pearls pearls pearls and all
I'll give you all I've got to give
Rings, pearls, rings, pearls and all
I've got to get you together, baby
I'm sure, sure, sure, sure you're gonna crawl, all right
Oh
Try to love another man
My little schoolgirl
Sure sure sure sure
I ain't gonna say her name
Oh Rosie, my girl
Oh Rosie babe, my girl
I bring you diamonds and I bring you pearls
Never gonna leave you girl
Rosie girl, I'll give you everything that I've ever got to give
I'll give you everything that I've ever ever got to give
Don't you leave me, Rosie baby
Don't keep it here
Don't you leave me, babe
Come on, give it, girl
It's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's okay
Don't you know what I am saying
But I'm having a good time
They call me the hunter
Baby, baby, that's my name
They call me the hunter
That's how I got my way
Ah, ain't no need to hide
Ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sight
Squeeze my lemon
Until the juice runs down my leg, can just have, uh huh
Squeeze my lemon
Till the juice runs down my leg
If you don't squeeze my lemon, I want you to babe, ah ha
I say I'm gonna kick you out of bed
But I've got you in the sights of my lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin' gun
I'll just take it away from ya
How many more times
Treat me the way you do
Oh child, treat me the way you wanna do
I'll give ya, I'll give ya, babe
Baby baby baby, please be true
I'm talkin' to ya, babe
I said I'm not kidding
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
