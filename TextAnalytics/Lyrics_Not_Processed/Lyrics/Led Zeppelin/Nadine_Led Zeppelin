I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off this bus
Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine. honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I see you darling you got something else to do
Downtown searching for her, looking all around
See you coming to me, here we yellow cab
She move around, look, go go. (? )
Oh honey is that you ?
