[Verse 1]
Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows

[Chorus]
You know it's all right
I said it's all right
I know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start

[Verse 2]
Now crazy ways are evident
In the way you're wearin' your clothes
Sippin' booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

[Chorus]
I said it's all right
You know it's all right
I said it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start

[Verse 3]
You told your mam'er I'd get you home
But you didn't say I got no car
I saw a lion, he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar

[Chorus]
Ohhh, you know it's all right
I said it's all right
I guess it's all in my heart ohhh
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start

[Verse 1]
So, dancing days are here again
As the evening starts to grow
I've got my flower, I've got my power
You are my woman who knows

[Chorus]
I said it's all right
You know it's all right
I know it's all in my, all in my, all in my
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start
Hey, isn't it?
