[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I had a dream, oh yeah
Crazy dream, oh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song, yeah
People won't you listen now?
Sing along, oh
You don't know what you're missing now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow now, push, push, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu Starbright
The song remains the same, ooh yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
All you gotta do now, all you gotta do now
Sing out Hare Hare
Dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights are oh so bright
As we go sliding, sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding
Through
