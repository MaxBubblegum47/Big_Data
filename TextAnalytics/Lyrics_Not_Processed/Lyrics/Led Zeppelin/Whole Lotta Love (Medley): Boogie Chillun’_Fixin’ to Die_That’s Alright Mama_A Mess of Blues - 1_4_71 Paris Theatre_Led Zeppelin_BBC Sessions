One night, one night I was layin' down, oh Lord
Could hear my mama an' papa talkin' an' all
I hear them say, you gotta let that boy boogie woogie
'Cause it's in him, it's got to come out
It felt so good
I think I've been boogin' just the same, yes, I have, whoa yeah
Well, mama's been talkin', papa did too
Way that you move, 't's too good for you
Gotta boogie mama, whoa-ooh-oh-ooh
A-boogie, mama
Boogie all night long
I told my baby late last night
The way that you move, can't sing it right, oh
Hey, oh
They were boogin' all night long
Ooh, yeah
Ah ah, yeah
Oh
I believe my mind's gone
Believe I'm fixin' to die
I've been in my mind, y'all
Believe I'm fixin' to die
Said I don't mind, darlin'
But I came to see my children cry
Said my baby, oh, let me outta there
Oh, take me, baby baby baby
All right, baby, little girl
If you can roll it, keep on goin' till I'm deal
Ooh, yeah
That's all right, mama
That's all right for you
That's all right, mama
Any way will set for you
Well, that's all right
Well, that's all right
Well, that's all right
Mama mama, any way you do
I took that ...
That meant twenty-one
C'mon baby
We're gonna have some fun
But, that's all right
But, that's all right
But, that's all right
Ma ma ma, any way you do, ah babe
I'm teasin', teasin', teasin'
Teasin', teasin', teasin'

Well, that's all wrong, ma ma ma ma
Any way you do
Yes, that's all right, ma ma
Any way you do
I just got your letter baby
Too bad you can't come home
I swear I'm goin' crazy
Sittin' here all alone
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues
I ain't slept a week since Sunday
I can't eat a thing all day
A-every day is just blue Monday
Since you've been away
Since you're gone, ah gone
I got a mess of blues
Whoops, there goes a teardrop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
Baby, it ain't no disgrace
I gotta get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train goin'
And leave my blues behind
Since you're gone, gone, gone
I got a mess of blues, yeah
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues
Oh baby, since you're gone-one
I got a mess of blues
Said I hear what I'm saying
Way down inside, you really need
Oh
Shake for me girl
I wanna be your back door man
My baby
Oh yeah
Keep a-coolin, baby
Keep a-coolin, baby
Keep a-coolin, baby
Keep a-coolin, baby
Ah ah
Ah ah
