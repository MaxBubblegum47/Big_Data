[Verse 1]
Down by the seaside
See the boats go sailing
Can the people hear
Oh, what the little fish are saying?

[Refrain]
Oh oooh
The people turned away, oh
The people turned away

[Verse 2]
Down in the city streets
See all the folk go racing, racing
No time left, oh no
To pass the time of day

[Refrain]
Hey, hey, yeah
The people turned away
The people turned away
So far away, so far away

[Bridge]
See how they run, see how they run
See how they run, see how they run...
Do you still do the twist?
Do you find you remember things that well?
I wanna tell you
Some go twisting every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, ohh

[Verse 3]
Out in the country
Hear the people singing
Singing about their growin'
Knowing where they're goin'
Yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, the people turned away, yeah
Oh, the people turned away

[Verse 4]
Sing loud for the sunshine
Pray hard for the rain
And show your love for Lady Nature
And she will come back again
Yeah, yes, she will

[Refrain]
Oh, the people turned away
The people turned away
