[Verse 1]
From the window of your rented limousine
I caught your pretty blue eyes
One day soon you're gonna reach sixteen
Painted lady in the city of lies

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, babe
I must be the one you need, yeah

[Verse 2]
Clutching pages from your teenage dream
In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise
Through the circus of the L.A. queens
How fast you learn the downhill slide

[Chorus]
Oh, how you like my face?
Still don't know your name
You know I'm the one you want, babe, ooh yes
I must be the one you need, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, you got me feeling...

[Guitar solo]
Just a bit, just a bit

[Verse 3]
Lips like cherries and the brow of a queen
Come on, flash it, flash it in my eyes
Said you dug me since you were thirteen
Then you giggle as you heave and sigh

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
Baby, I gotta tell you, I'm the one you want
And everybody know I'm the one you need, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, give it to me, come on now
Come on now
Come on now

[Verse 4]
Hours, hours, and the moments in between
Oh, baby, I couldn't count the times
The fun of coming, oh, the pain in leaving
Baby, dry those silver eyes

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, ooh yes
I'm the one you need, yeah

[Outro]
Ooh, that's right
Ooh, yeah, that's right
Ooh, that's right
That's right
That's right
Ooh yeah, that's right
That's right
Aahh[repeat]
