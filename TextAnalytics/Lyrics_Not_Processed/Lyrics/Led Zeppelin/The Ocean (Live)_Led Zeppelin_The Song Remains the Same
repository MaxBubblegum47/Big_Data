[John Bonham]
We've done four already, but now we're steady
And then they went, "One, two, three, four"
Singin' in the sunshine, laughin' in the rain
Rockin' on the moonshine, rollin' in the grain
Got no time to pack my bag, my foot's outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late for the high hopes hailla ball
Uh-huh
Do it
Sittin' 'round, singin' songs 'till the night turns into day
Used to sing on the mountains, but the mountains washed away
Now I'm singin' all my songs to the girl who won my heart
Now, she's only four years old, and it's a real fine way to start
Ohhhhhh
La, la, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Laa, la, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La, la, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Laa, la, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Singin' to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar
Play for me and play for free and play a whole lot more
Singin' 'bout the good things, and the sun that lights the day
I used to sing to the ocean, has the ocean lost its way?
I don't think so
I don't know-hoh, I don't know-hoh-oo-ohh
I don't know, I don't know-hoh
It's so
Shoo-wop a-diddly-iddly, doo-wop a diddly-iddly
Doo-wop a diddly-iddly, doo-wop a diddly-iddly
Doo-wop a diddly-iddly, doo-wop
Doo-wop, ohhhh ohhhh, oh, it's so good
It's so good, so-oh goo-ooo-ood
