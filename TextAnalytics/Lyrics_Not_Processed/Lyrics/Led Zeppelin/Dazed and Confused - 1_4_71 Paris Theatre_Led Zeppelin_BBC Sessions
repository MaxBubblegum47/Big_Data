Dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Sweet little baby, say what you will
Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill

You hurt and abused, tellin' all of your lies
Run 'round sweet baby, Lord, how you hypnotize
Tryin' to love you, baby, but you go on hurtin' so
Soul of a woman was created below

Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard-earned pay
Sweet little baby baby, then you take it away
I wanna love you baby, but you do me so bad
The worst little woman I once ever had, I've got to quit you baby

Ma ma, yeah
Ma ma ma

Oh
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Oh
Oh
Hey
Yeah

I've been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Sweet little woman, say what you will
Tongue wag so much when you end up in hell

It's gonna burn burn
Ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
