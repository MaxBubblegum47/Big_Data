[Verse 1]
Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

[Verse 2]
Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

[Verse 4]
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

[Verse 5]
People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

[Verse 6]
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah
I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

[Instrumental break 2:02-3:40]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 7]
Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

[Outro]
Heartbreaker; your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker!
Heartbreaker!
Heart!
