[Verse 1]
I can't quit you baby
Woman I think I'm gonna put you down for a little while
I can't quit you babe
I think I'm gonna put you down for a while

I said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child

[Verse 2]
You built my hopes so high
Baby then you let me down so low
You built my hopes so high
Then ya let me down, ya let me down, ya let me down so low

Don'tcha realize sweet baby?
Woman I don't know... which way to go

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Woman, I can't quit you babe
I think I'm gonna put you down for a while
