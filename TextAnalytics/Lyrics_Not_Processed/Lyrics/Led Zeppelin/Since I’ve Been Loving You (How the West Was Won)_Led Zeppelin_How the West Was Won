[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Oh-oh
I've been workin' from seven to eleven every night
Lemme tell ya, lemme tell ya, lemme tell ya, it really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right

[Verse 1]
I've really been the best, the best of fools, yeah
Oh have mercy, I did what I could, yeah, oh
Oh I love you, mama, how was I, babe
Oh I love you
Ohhhhh, little girl, little girl

[Chorus]
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lo-oo-ose my worried mind

[Verse 2]
Ev'rybody trying to tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I said I've tried, oh, ow, ow
I've tried to do the best I could

[Refrain]
I've been working from seven, seven, seven, seven
Seven, seven, seven, seven, oh, to eleven every night
It really, it really makes it a drag
Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, ow, I don't think that's right
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, babe-yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, only for five minutes

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Oooooooooooooooooh, I've been cryin', cryin'-oh
All my tears they fell like rain, rain
Whoahhhhhh, somebody hear them calling
Please, please, please, whoa-oh-oh, now listen

[Verse 3]
Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door
You had the nerve to tell me you didn't want me no more
I open my front door, I hear my back door slam
I think I got one o' them.....
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Refrain]
I've been working working working from seven
Ooooooooh, to eleven every night
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
It just isn't right
So baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm about to lose my worried mind
I can't really lose it, I don't really want to loo-oose it, no no no no
Oh yeah, don't make me, don't make me, don't make me, don't make me lose
Oh, my worried mind
Oh
