[Verse 1]
Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long just watch an' see
How the fellas lay their money down

[Verse 2]
Her style is new but the face is same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

[Verse 3]
Ooh yeah, it's been ten years and maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

[Verse 4]
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace of the Lord above

[Verse 5]
People talkin' all around
'Bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

[Verse 6]
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name, name, name, name, name, awww yee-ahhh

[Guitar Solo]

Ooooh yeahhh

[more Guitar Solo]

[Verse 7]
Ohhhhh, work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

[Outro]
Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heart
