[Verse 1]
Ah, it's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the stroll
Let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from, whoa-ooh-oh-ooh-oh

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

[Verse 2]
Oh, it seems so long since I walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms, open your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time, yes, it has
Rock on!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
It's been a long time since the book of love
I can't count the tears of a life with no loo-ooo-ove
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
It's been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Ooh yeah, ooh-ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh-ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh-ooh yeah, oh
Ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Oh yeah
