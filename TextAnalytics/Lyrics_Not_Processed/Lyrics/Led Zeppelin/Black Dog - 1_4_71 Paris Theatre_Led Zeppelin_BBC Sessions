Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Ah, ah, child, way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Ah, ah, child, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, can't keep away
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flamin' heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine burning red
Dreams of you all through my head
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
Hey, baby, whoa, baby, pretty baby
Tell me that you'll do me now
I'm gonna find a woman, Lord
Keep me rollin' with the Lord above
Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friends she gonna be a star
I don't know but I been told
A big legged woman ain't got no soul
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah yeah
All I ask for, all I pray
Steady rollin' woman gonna come my way
I need a girl gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
