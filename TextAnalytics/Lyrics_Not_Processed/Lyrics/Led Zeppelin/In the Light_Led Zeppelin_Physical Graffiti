[Intro]

[Verse 1]
And if you feel that you can't go on
And your will's sinking low
Just believe, and you can't go wrong
In the light, you will find the road
You will find the road

[Verse 2]
Hey, ooh, did you ever believe that I could leave you
Standing out in the cold?
Yeah, baby, I know how it feels cause I have slipped through
To the very depths of my soul, yeah
Oh-ho, baby, I just want to show you what a clear view
It is from every bend in the road
Now listen to me
Oh, whoa-whoa, as I was
And really would be for you, too, honey
As you would for me, oh, I would share your load
Let me share your load
Ooh, let me share, share your load

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
And if you feel that you can't go on
In the light, you will find the road
Hey, oh ho, the the winds of change may blow around you
But that will always be so
Whoa whoa, when love is pain it can devour you, but you are never alone
I will share your load, I will share your load
Baby, let me, oh, let me

[Bridge]
In the light
Everybody needs the light
Ooh, yeah yeah
Ooh, baby
In the light, in the light, in the light
[?]

[Outro]
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, ooh, yeah
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, ooh yeah yeah
Light, light, light, in the light, everybody, come on now
