[Verse 1]
Hey, girl, stop what you're doing!
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you, but I like it a lot
Won't you let me hold you, let me feel your loving touch

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

[Verse 2]
Hey, babe, I got something I think you ought to know
Hey, babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go, 'cause I like your charms

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane! Yeah!

[Outro]
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love me all night)
(I want you to love me all night)
Communication breakdown
(Whoa, ah, a whoa oh)
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love me)
(I want you to love)
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love, yeah)
(I want you to love)
