Leaves are falling all around
It's time I was on my way
For such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go
The autumn moon lights my way
For now, I smell the rain
And with it pain
And it's headed my way
Ah sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on
And now's the time the time is now
To sing my song
I'm goin' 'round the world
I got to find my girl, on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day, ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time to for spreadin' roots
The time has come to be gone
And tho' our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

I ain't tellin' no lie
Mine's a tale that can't be told
My freedom I hold dear;
How years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of mordor
I met a girl so fair
But gollum, and the evil one, crept up
And slipped away with her
Her, her... yea
Ain't nothing I can do, no

Gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gotta keep-a-searchin' for my baby...
Gonna work my way, round the world
I can't stop this feelin' in my heart
Gotta keep searchin' for my baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I'd listen to my bluebird sing but I can't find my bluebird
A-keep-a ramblin' baby
