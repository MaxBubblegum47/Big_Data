Oh, oh Darlene
Oh, oh, oh Darlene
Ooh, come on baby give me, me some
When I see you at that dance
With your tight dress on
What you got it sure is fine
I want to get me some
Darlene
Ooh baby baby Darlene
Ooh, be my baby Darlene
Ooh, come on baby
Come on, come on, come on my babe
Darlene
Ooh, Darlene
Hey hey, Darlene
Oh oh, come back and be my sweet little girl
When I see you on the street
It makes my heart go flitter
I see you walking with all those guys
It makes me feel so sick
Now I don't care what people say
And I don't care what they do
Sweet child I gotta make you mine
You're the only thing that I want: you, yeah
And baby baby, when you walk down the block
See the people walk by
Woo child, y'know you drive me wild!
I got to do it with you, come on try
Ooh baby, I got my car
I will take you where it's fine
I am going to take you every place
Do you wanna boogie-woogie-woogie-woogie, that's fine
I'm going to boogie, Darlene
I'm going to make you my girl
I'm going to boogie, Darlene
I'm going to send you in another world
Cause I love you, Darlene
And I love you, Yes I do
I've been saving all my money
I've been working all day long
I gotta give it all back to you
Oh but I love you, Darlene
Cause I love you, yes I do
I've been working, it's true
I've been working all day long
I've been trying to get it home for you
And I love you, Darlene
Yes I love you, yes I do
I got a pink carnation and a pickup truck
Saving it all for you
Oh I love you
Go
Go, go, go, go, go
