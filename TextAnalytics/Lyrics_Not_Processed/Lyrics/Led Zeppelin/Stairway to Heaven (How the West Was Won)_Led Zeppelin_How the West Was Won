[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word, she can get what she came for
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven, you know

Ah-oh

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts, I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking, that's you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon
If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter, remember laughter

[Chorus]
Ohhh yeah-ee-yeah, yeah-ee-yeah, yeah-ee-yeah, yeah-ee-yeah, yeah-ee-yeah, yeah-ee-yeah
And it makes me wonder, wait a minute

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May-Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It really, really, really, really, really makes

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming and it won't go
Because you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind, oh-oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know, yeah
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last, yeah
When all is one and one is all, that's what it is
To be a rock and not to roll-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooll, yeah

[Outro]
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
