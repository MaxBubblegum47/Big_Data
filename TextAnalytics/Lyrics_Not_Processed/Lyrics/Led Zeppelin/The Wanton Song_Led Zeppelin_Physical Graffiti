[Chorus]
Silent woman in the night, you came
Took my seed from 
my shaking frame
Same old fire, another flame
And the wheel rolls on

[Verse 1]
Silent woman through the flames, you come
From the deep behind the sun
Seems my nightmares, my loving gun
Left me barely holding on, oh

[Verse 2]
With blazing eyes
 you see 
my trembling hand
When we know the time has come
Lose my senses, lose command
Feel your healing rivers run

[Verse 3]
Is it every time I fall
That I think this is the one?
Ooh, in the darkness can you hear me call?
Another day has just begun
Another day, yeah

[Guitar Solo]
Ooooh

[Chorus]
Silent woman, my face is changed
Some know in ways to come
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame
And the wheel rolls on, rolls on
Rolls on, rolls on, babe, oooooooh
