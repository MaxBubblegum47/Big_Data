[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

[Bridge]
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

[Verse 1]
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong
With you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration - look, see

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
And so today, my world, it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
And thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Alright, yeah
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness - I'm glad

[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me
