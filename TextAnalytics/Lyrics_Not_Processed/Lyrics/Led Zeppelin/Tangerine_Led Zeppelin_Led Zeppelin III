[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, four
One, two

[Verse 1]
Measuring a summer's day
I only find it slips away to grey
The hours they bring me pain

[Chorus]
Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between

[Verse 2]
Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these?
To think of us again
And I do

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between
