[Verse 1]
Baby, when you walk that sweet walk
Oh, you walk it good, yes you walk it good
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk
It sounds so good, oh so good

[Chorus]
With a little bit of concentration
And a little bit of helping hands, yeah
And a little bit of raving madness
You know it makes me feel, baby
Both my feet are back on the ground

[Verse 2]
And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh so good
Baby, if it keeps a-shaking
It will do you good, oh so much good

[Chorus]
With a little bit of stop-a-shaking, shaking
And a little bit of fly right down
Woo, just a little bit of sweet con-carne
It makes me feel, makes me feel
I got my feet on the ground

[Verse 3]
Ooh now baby, when you move it makes me
Really feel so good, oh so good
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
And I'm good, oh, so good

[Chorus]
With a little bit of, oh, concentration
And a little bit of helping hands, yeah
And a little bit of, oh way, I like this
It makes me feel, it makes me feel, baby
I'm back on the ground
Oh yes, it sure does
It makes me feel back on the ground
Suarez! Suarez!
Baby, baby, you're back on the ground!
I'm feeling good child
I'm feeling good child
I'm feeling good child
I'm feeling good child
Down on the ground
