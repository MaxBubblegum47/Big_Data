Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and-a groovin' gonna
Satisfy my soul

Let's have a party
Let's have a party
Send 'im to the store let's
By some more
Let's have a party tonight

I never kissed a bear
I never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of a room

Honky-tonky Joe
Is knockin' at the door
So bring 'im in and fill 'im up
And send 'im ( ? )

We're gonna have
A party
Tonight yeah whoah whoah
