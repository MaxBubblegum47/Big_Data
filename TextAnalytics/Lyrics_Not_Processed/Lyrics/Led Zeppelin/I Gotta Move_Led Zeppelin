I told you baby
Long time ago
I don't want no woman
Baby, mess around my door
I gotta move
Baby, baby, baby, I got to move
I don't want you messin' woman
I don't want your foolin' round with me
Hey
I told you baby
Once upon a time
You would be my woman
Said oh, you'll be mine
But that is alright
That's alright, alright
Whoa that is alright baby
Treat me wrong tonight
Whoa, don't want you baby
Always foolin' round with me
Oh no no no no
I don't want my baby
Always foolin' round with me
She tries to make me leave her
Always get away from me
