This is the springtime of my loving-
The second season i am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing-
So little warmth i've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing-
I watched the fire that grew so low
It is the summer of my smiles-
Flee from me keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you i give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize-
These things are clear to all from
Time to time. ooooh...
Talk talk-
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us...
But i know that i love you so
But i know that i love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion-
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient-
Upon us all a little rain
Must fall, just a little rain?
Ooooh, yeah yeah yeah!
