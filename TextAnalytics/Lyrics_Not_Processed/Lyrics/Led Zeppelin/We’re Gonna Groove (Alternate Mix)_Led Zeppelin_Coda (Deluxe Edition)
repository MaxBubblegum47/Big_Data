[Verse 1]
Hear my baby comin' down the track
Betcha my baby's comin' back
Someday she'll get back to me
We're gonna raise a family

[Chorus]
We're gonna groove, yeah groove
Yeah we're gonna groove
Whoa, my baby, we're gonna love, love, love
Until the brink of day

Sweet as sweet as sweet can be
You don't know whatcha do to me
Let me say you're my one desire
You just set my soul on fire

[Chorus]
Oh we're gonna groove, yeah groove
Yeah we're gonna groove baby
My baby, baby we're gonna love, love, love
Until the brink of day

[Verse 3]
Sweet as sweet as sweet can be
Lemme tell ya you don't know whatcha do to me
You just set my soul on fire
Woman you know you're my one desire, my one desire, my one

[Chorus]
We gonna groove oh we gonna groove
We gonna groove yeah
And we're gonna love, love, love
Until the brink of day
We gonna groove yeah, groove
And we're gonna groove
