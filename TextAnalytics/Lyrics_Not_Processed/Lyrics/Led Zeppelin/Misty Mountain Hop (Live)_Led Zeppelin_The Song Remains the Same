Walking in the park just the other day, baby
What d'ya, what d'ya think I saw?
Crowds of people sitting on the grass
With flowers in their hair said, "Hey, boy, do you wanna score"

"Do I wanna score?"
I really don't know what time it was, whoa-ho-ho
So I asked 'em if I could stay a while

I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Ooh yes, I was really outta my mind
Just then, a policeman stepped up to us
Asked us, said, please, please, hey
Would we get, get in line, get in line

They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Ho-ho-ho, he said that his friends would all stop by

Really don't you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see
And baby, baby, baby, do ya like it?
There you sit, sittin' spare like a book on a shelf
Ohhhh, you're not rustin' baby, you ain't tryin' to fight it

I really don't care if they're comin', whoa-ho-ho
I believe that it's all a state of mind

[Guitar Solo]

If you go down in the streets today, baby, you better
Oooh, you better open your eyes, you know what I'm talkin' about
Folk down there really don't care, don't care
Really don't, which, a-which way the pressure lies
A-that's a lot of pressure

So I'm packin' my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits soar now
Over the hills where the spirits fly
I gotta get there, I gotta get there
Ohhhhh, rock it

I really don't know, know, know, know, know, know, know
I really don't know, know, know, know
I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh-oh-oh
