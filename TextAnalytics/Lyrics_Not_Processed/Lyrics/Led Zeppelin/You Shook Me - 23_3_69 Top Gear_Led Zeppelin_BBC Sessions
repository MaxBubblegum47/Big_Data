[Chorus]
You know you shook me
You shook me all night long
You know you shook me baby
You shook me all night long
You shook me so hard baby
Baby, baby, baby I can't leave you alone
No, no, no, no

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
You know you shook me babe
You shook me all night long
I know you really, really did babe
I said, you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
You shook me so, so hard, baby
So
So
So hard
So hard
You shook me all night long
