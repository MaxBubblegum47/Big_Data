[Hook]
One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
Sometimes its hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite

[Verse 1]
A man I know went down to Louisiana
Had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John Cameron with Suzanna
He kissed the whiskers, left and right
Whiskers

[Verse 2]
Now, now, now, fright subsides
Out at a hotel in the quarter
Our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set that room alight
Whiskers

[Verse 3]
Down on Bourbon street, you know it's right
You can see my friend
They run around all through the night
Most everywhere
Until the closet's bare
Run for the razor burn
Doin' up my hair
New Orleans queens
Sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems alright
When I step out
Strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like Barry White!

[Hook]
One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
Sometimes its hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite
