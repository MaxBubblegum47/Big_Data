[Verse 1]
As I walk down the highway
All I do is sing a song
And a train that's passin' my way
Helps the rhythm move along

There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong, it's oh so strong

I'm just a simple guy
I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown
And blows my blues away

There's nothing more that I can say
But on a day like today I pass the time away
And walk a quiet mile with you

[Chorus]
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm so glad I'm living
Gonna tell the world I am
I got me a fine woman
And she says that I'm her man

One thing that I know for sure
Gonna give her all the loving
Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can

Standing in the noonday sun
Trying to flag a ride
People go and people come
See my rider right by my side

It's a total disgrace, they set the pace
It must be a race and the best thing I can do is run

[Chorus]
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah

[Outro]
Da da da da 70 more
All I do is say let's keep on
Gonna keep on movin' on
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
