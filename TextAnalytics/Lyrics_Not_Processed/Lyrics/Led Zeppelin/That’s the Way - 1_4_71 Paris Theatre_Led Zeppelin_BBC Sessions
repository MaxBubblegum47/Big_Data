I don't know how I'm gonna tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend, the boy next door
I can't believe what people sayin'
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town
And when I'm out I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me
Could it be you've found another game to play
What did mama say to me
That's the way
Oh, that's the way it ought to be, oh oh, yeah now
Mama, ma ma ma ma ma, said
That's the way it ought to stay, ah, ooh, ah, ah
And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying
Had they got you hypnotized, don't you even think about it
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
And all that lives is born to die
So I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry
I don't know what to say about it
When all you ears have turned away
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see
Is that the way it ought to stay
That's the way
That's the way it ought'a be, yeah
That's the way it's gonna stay, ah yeah, ah hah, ho ho, ah
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Whoa yeah
Oh oh, yeah, ah, oh yeah
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe
Oh
