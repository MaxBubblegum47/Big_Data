[Verse 1]
Then, as it was, then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Flying skies of fortune, each a separate way
On the wings of maybe, downing birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didnâ€™t have to go
But as the eagle leaves the nest, got so far to go

[Hook]
Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
Did you ever really need somebody
And really need 'em bad?
Did you ever really want somebody
The best love you ever had?
Do you ever remember me, baby?
Did it feel so good?
Cause it was just the first time
And you knew you would

[Verse 3]
Through the eyes and I sparkle, senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way, see your feathers preen
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, the nest is in our soul

[Hook]
Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be
Oh darling, oh darling
Oh, oh darling, oh yeah, oh darling

[Outro]
I'm never going to leave you
I'm never going to leave
Holding on, ten years gone
Ten years gone, holding on, ten years gone
I'm never, I'm never
Oooh, yeah...
