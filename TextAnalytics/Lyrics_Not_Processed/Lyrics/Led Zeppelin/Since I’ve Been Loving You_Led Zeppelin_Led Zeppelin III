[Pre-Chorus]
Been working from seven
To eleven every night
Really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right

[Verse 1]
I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
Cause I love you, baby, how I love you, darling
How I love you, baby, my beloved little girl, little girl

[Chorus]
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you, I really did the best I could

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been, I've been working from seven
To eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag, drag
Lord, yeah, that ain't right, now, now

[Chorus]
Since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I said I've been crying, yeah
Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?

[Verse 3]
Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, I hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them newfangled
Newfangled back-door men

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been a-working from seven, seven, seven
To eleven, eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, a drag, drag
Ah yeah! It makes it a drag

[Chorus]
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose, I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind
Oh yeah
Just one more, just one more, ooh, yeah
Since I've been loving you, I'm gonna lose my worried mind
