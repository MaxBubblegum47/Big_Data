[Intro]

[Chorus]
I've been dazed an' confused for so long it's not true
I wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Now lots of people talkin', pretty few of them a-know
Soul of a woman was created below, that's right

You're the one, you're the one

[Verse 1]
Oh, everybody's been talkin', Lord
I swear they been talkin' trash (trash)
The way that ya push, push, push, push, push, push me darlin'
I can't take too much of that
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon whoah darlin' show me the way
I wanna make love to ya, little girl, twenty five
Twenty five
Twenty five
Twenty five
Ohhhhhhh

[Verse 2]
Said you hurt an' abuse, tellin' all of your lies
I try to quit you, baby, but ya keep me
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mesmerized
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, say what you will
I wanna make love to ya again, darlin', twenty five
