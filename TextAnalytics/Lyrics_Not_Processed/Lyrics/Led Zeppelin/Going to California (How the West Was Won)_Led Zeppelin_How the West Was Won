Good evening!
This is going to be Going To California

[Verse 1]
Spend my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind, make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair, I didn't see too many this time
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all all the same

[Verse 2]
Hoh, the sea was red and the sky was grey
I wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
The children of the sun began to awake, come on children

[Verse 3]
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking, ah ah
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll see you up there where the path
Runs straight and high, oh-ooooh-ooooh

[Verse 4]
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and she sings, Joni
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in a mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, ooh-ooh-ooh, sure is hard, yeah

Oh, its hard

Oh
