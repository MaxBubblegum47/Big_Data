AVICII
Looking up
There's always sky
Rest your head
I'll take you high
We won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness
Why worry now
You'll be safe
Hold my hand
Just in case
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
This world can seem
Cold and grey
But you and I
Are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
Nothing to fear
But fear itself
We'll be OK
Just keep the faith
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Whoa
Whoa (fade into darkness)
Whoa
Whoa (fade into darkness)
Whoa
And we won't fade into darkness (whoa)
Fade into darkness (whoa)
No we won't fade into darkness (whoa)
Fade into darkness (whoa)
Whoa
Fade into darkness
