[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now
And if tomorrow never comes
I'm gonna stay forever young
These lungs of mine were made to scream and shout
I said hey, hey, what you say?
It seems like trouble's on the way
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now
It's singing oh, oh oh oh
I said hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday

[Pre-Drop: Bebe Rexha]
Got no
I-I got no
I've got no
I've got no use for yesterday
Got no
I-I got no
I've got no
I've got no use for yesterday

[Drop]

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now
And if tomorrow never comes
I'm gonna stay forever young
These lungs of mine were made to scream and shout
I said hey, hey, what you say?
It seems like trouble's on the way
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now
It's singing oh, oh oh oh
I said hey, hey, what you say?
I've got no use for yesterday

[Pre-Drop: Bebe Rexha]
Got no, I got no
I-I got no
I've got no
I've got no use for yesterday
Got no, got no, got no, got no, got no
I've got no use for yesterday
