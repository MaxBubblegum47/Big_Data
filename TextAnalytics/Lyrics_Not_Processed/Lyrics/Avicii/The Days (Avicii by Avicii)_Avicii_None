[Verse 1]
Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
We used to believe that the stars aligned
Together forever, but we ran out of time

[Pre-Chorus]
Heartache, heartbreak
It's taking its toll
Why won't you stay by my side, baby, don't go
I'm in pieces
Pick me up and put me together

[Chorus]
These are the days I've been waiting for
To hear you say you can't wait for more
Keep it coming 'cause we can't say no
These are the days worth dying for
These are the days worth dying for

These are the days I've been waiting for
To hear you say you can't wait for more
Keep it coming 'cause we can't say no
These are the days worth dying for
These are the days worth dying for
