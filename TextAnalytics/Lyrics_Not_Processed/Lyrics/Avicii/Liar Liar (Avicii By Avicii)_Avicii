Follow you to dust
Leaving footprints on the clouds as we're walking home
Iron hearts all turn to rust
[?]
[?] apocalypse
Chasing shadows with ideas that don't exist, anymore
We need to find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way

We are, who we are, when we're all going under
When the past with the last and will last until we're under
We are, who we are, when we're all going under
When the past with the last and will last until we're under

Liar, liar!
