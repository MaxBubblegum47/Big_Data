[Verse 1]
Hey brother!
Do you still believe in one another?
Hey sister!
Do you still believe in love, I wonder

[Refrain]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call!
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out!
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Post-Chorus]
Far from home
Far from home

[Verse 1]
Hey brother!
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister!
Do you still believe in love, I wonder

[Refrain]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call!
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out!
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Post-Chorus]
Far from home
Far from home
