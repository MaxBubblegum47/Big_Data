[Verse 1: Vargas & 
Agnes
]
Weight is on me, weight is on you
We scream and we fight like there's nothing to lose
End of the day, come and take my all
There’s no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Weight is on you, weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try, we 
stumble
 and we fall
There’s no place I'd rather be than in your arms

[Chorus: Vargas & Agnes]
Give me tough love and a lesson to learn
Your tough love is what I discern
Sweet tough love, you're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Vargas & Agnes]
Weight is on you, weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try, we stumble and we fall
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

[Chorus: Vargas & Agnes]
Give me tough love and a lesson to learn
Your tough love is what I discern
Sweet tough love, you’re my pretty good luck charm
There’s no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Give me tough love and a lesson to learn
Your tough love is what I discern
Sweet tough love, you’re my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
