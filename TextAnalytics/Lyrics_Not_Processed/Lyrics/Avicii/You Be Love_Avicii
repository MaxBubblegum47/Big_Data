[Verse 1]
You can be the potter
I'll be the clay
You can be the blacksmith
And I'll be the blade
You can be the poet
And I'll be the song
You can be the sunlight
And I'll be the dawn

[Chorus]
You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
Love you like no other
(I'll be your lover)

[Verse 2]
I will be your compass
If you'll be my north
I will be your sailor
If you'll be my shore
You can be the gravity
I'll be the fall
You can be my everything
And I'll be your all

[Chorus]
You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
Love you like no other
(I'll be your lover)

[Bridge]
If you were heaven I would gladly take my last breath
If you're the edge then I would gladly take the next step
Be the rain
Coming down
Be the flood
Come on take me 'til I, take me 'til I drown
I need you now

[Chorus]
You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
Love you like no other
(I'll be your lover)

[Post-Chorus]
You can be the poet
I'll be the song
You can be the sunlight
I’ll be the dawn
You can be my everything
I’ll be your all
