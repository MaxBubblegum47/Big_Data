[Verse 1]
I've been a beggar and I've been a king
I've been a loner and I've worn the ring
Losing myself just to find me again
I'm a million miles smarter, but I ain't learned a thing
I've been a teacher and a student of hurt
I've kept my word for whatever that's worth
Never been last, but I've never been first
Oh I may not be the best, but I'm far from the worst
Oh I may not be the best, but I'm far from the worst

[Chorus]
Oh I've seen trouble more than any man should bear
But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
And I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from
But there's still another million miles to come

[Verse 2]
I keep on searching for the city of gold
And I'm gonna follow this yellow brick road
Thinking that maybe, it might lead me home
I'm a million miles farther and a long way from home
I know that there's a plan that goes way beyond mine
Got to step back just to see the design
The mind fears the heart, but the heart doesn't mind
Oh I may not be perfect, but I'm loving this life
Oh I may not be perfect, but I'm loving this life

[Chorus]
Oh I've seen trouble more than any man should bear
But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
And I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from
But there's still another million miles to come
