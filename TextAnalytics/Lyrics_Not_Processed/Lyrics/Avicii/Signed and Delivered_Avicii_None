[Pre-Chorus]
There's a fever in the ghetto
There's a fire in their eyes
I was somewhere in the middle
Left my way to Caprol High
Everybody wanna kill me
Girl just cause' you so fine

[Chorus]
Don't let them say to ya I'm not your man
I'm coming straight for ya I'm signed and delivered
Don't let them say to ya I'm not your man
I'm coming straight for ya I'm riding fast

[Post-Chorus]
And so I'm away too long
And soon all the love will be gone
The sum of love is just too strong
And I saw love

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a fever in the ghetto
There's a fire in their eyes
I was somewhere in the middle
Left my way to Caprol High
Everybody wanna kill me
Girl just cause' you so fine

[Chorus]
Don't let them say to ya I'm not your man
I'm coming straight for ya I'm signed and delivered
Don't let them say to ya I'm not your man
I'm coming straight for ya I'm riding fast

[Post-Chorus]
And so I'm away too long
And soon all the love will be gone
The sum of love is just too strong
And I saw love
