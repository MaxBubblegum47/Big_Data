[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
Take my hand, let's run
I'll bring my arrows, you bring your gun
Cloud of smoke
I don't know where, but I wanna go

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
It's in the sky, it's in the air
If I get lost, I'll meet you there
We can't stop, 'til we find our place
Let's saddle up and ride away

[Drop: Kacey Musgraves]
Let's ride away
Let's ride away
Mmm, let's ride away
Let's ride away

[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves]
Hold on tight to what we have
When it's this good, you don't look back
Tiny doves on the horizon
Yeah, you and me, quicker than lightning

[Chorus 2: Kacey Musgraves]
Over canyons and over plains
Let's saddle up and ride away

[Drop: Kacey Musgraves]
Let's ride away
Let's ride away
Mmm, let's ride away
Let's ride away

[Outro: Kacey Musgraves]
Mmm, let's ride away
