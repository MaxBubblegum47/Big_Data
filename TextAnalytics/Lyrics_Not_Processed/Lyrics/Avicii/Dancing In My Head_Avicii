[Verse 1]
Sugar caught me by surprise
Saying something in her eyes
Feels like I just kissed the curse
Met a girl and there ain't no words for her
Down the sunset, up the lights
Eh, people, it ain't right
I couldn't reach her anymore
Why, people, didn't I let her know?

[Pre-Chorus]
That girl I shouldn't have let her go
But she's still dancing in my head
That girl I shouldn't have let her go
But she's still dancing in my head

[Chorus x2]
Oh, yeah, baby, keep on dancing, keep on dancing
She's still dancing in my head
Oh, yeah, sugar, keep dancing, keep dancing
She's still dancing in my head

[Verse 2]
Open doors materialized
Disappear before my eyes
I felt like I've been dealt the worst
Hand, I do believe I have been cursed
Down the sunset, up the lights
Eh, people, it ain't right
I couldn't reach her anymore
Why, people, didn't I let her know?

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge]
Keep dancing, oh, keep dancing, yeah
Ah, don't stop dancing girl
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, no
Don't stop dancing girl
Girl, don't stop dancing, no
