[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
Liar, liar! No you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody say you're fireproof

[Verse 1: Blondfire]
Follow you to dust
Leaving footprints on the clouds as we're walking home
Iron hearts all turn to rust
Buy tears on the days on a diamond street
It speaks apocalypse
Chasing shadows, living dreams that don't exist, anymore
We need to find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way

[Pre-Chorus: Blondfire]
Well, we are, who we are, when we're all going under
When the past with the last and will last until we're under

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
Liar, liar! No you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody say you're fireproof

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Blondfire]
All closed and in your head
Counting heartbeats 'till the feeling's good and gone
On a dull path in a rush
A sad greed pouring rain over everything
It will lead us to apocalypse
Where the whispers of the sand and the sun eclipse, forever more
We need to find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way

[Pre-Chorus: Blondfire]
Well, we are, who we are, when we're all going under
When the past with the last and will last until we're under

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
Liar, liar! No you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody say you're fireproof

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Blondfire]
People talking but I can't hear them, no
I just sit there and watch them come and go
There might be something underneath it all
But at least I'll find the love found down the moon
But at least I'll find, we'll all find out in the end
