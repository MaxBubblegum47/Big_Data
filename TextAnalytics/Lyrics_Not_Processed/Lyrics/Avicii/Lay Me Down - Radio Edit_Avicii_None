Lay me, Lay-lay lay me
Lay-lay lay me
Lay-lay lay me
L-l-l-l-l-l-lay me, lay-lay lay me
Lay-lay lay me
Lay-lay, lay me down

I go weak, then get up
Sometimes my knees can barely hold me up
I'm no fool, but instead
You gotta walk a mile until you're outta my head

Going in/Go within, taste it up
Dig/Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Can't your life/Get your life, give a damn
You gotta make a move and show me where we can stand

Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)

Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)

Tell me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Tell me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
