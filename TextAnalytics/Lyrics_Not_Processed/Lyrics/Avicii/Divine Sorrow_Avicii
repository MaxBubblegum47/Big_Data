[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Dearie Blossom
I've gone down to old rock bottom
Now I know the love in my heart was true
Divine sorrow
I thank you for the joy that follow
Back then my friend
If only you knew

[Pre-Hook: Wyclef Jean]
It is harder
When you love beyond belief
But I'm a fool to let you go
So this is for you my love

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
We will never
We will never have a change of mind
We belong together
We will never
We will never be the weary kind
We sing our sorrows away
We sing our sorrows away
We sing our sorrows away

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Divine blessing
I wish I would have heard your lesson
Now I know your words were my only truth
I'm just venting
Oh maybe I am done confessing
Back then my friend
If only you knew

[Pre-Hook]
It is harder
When you love beyond belief
But I'm a fool to let you go
So this is for you my love

[Hook]
We will never
We will never have a change of mind
We belong together
We will never
We will never be the weary kind
We sing our sorrows away

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
We can make it through judgement day
We won't go fading away
All I ever know
Must be heaven you come from
We can make it through cloudy skies
By your side I feel alive
All I ever know must be heaven where you come from

[Instrumental Outro]
