[Verse]
They saw the lies I've told, make things right before I'm old
Nothing left for us to say, broken down on the freeway
Roadside I see things clearer
Outside my rearview mirror
Slave to the road, stuck by your side
I'm nothing but a passenger along for the ride
I'm nothing but a passenger along for the ride

[Chorus]
When I peer
 through my rearview mirror
Getting smaller as I disappear
Suddenly everything is so much clearer
And all I'm left with is my good friend fear
And promises of tears, and promises of tears

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
They saw the lies I've told, make things right before I'm old
Nothing left for us to say, broken down on the freeway
Roadside I see things clearer
Outside my rearview mirror
Slave to the road, stuck by your side
I'm nothing but a passenger along for the ride
I'm nothing but a passenger along for the ride

[Chorus]
When I peer through my rearview mirror
Getting smaller as I disappear
Suddenly everything is so much clearer
And all I'm left with is my good friend fear
And promises of tears, and promises of tears

[Instrumental Outro]
