If you should ever feel alone
You know you can call on me, call on me
When you've lost the will to carry on
You know you can't count on me, count on me to...
Catch you when you fall down
Never leave you standing out in the cold
When your heart aches
When you need a safe place
I want you to know
You should know...
When you wanna run away
You can always come, you can come to me
When you wanna run away
You can always run
You can always run to me, me, me
You can always run to me, me, me
When you wanna run away
You can always run to me
It doesn't matter where you are
I'll come if you call on, call on me
Cause even when we're far apart
You know you can count on me, count on me to...
Catch you when you fall down
Never leave you standing out in the cold
When your heart aches
When you need a safe place
I want you to know
You should know...
When you wanna run away
You can always come, you can come to me
When you wanna run away
You can always run
You can always run to me, me, me
You can always run to me, me, me
When you wanna run away
You can always run to me
Run, run, run, run...
