[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hey now
We ain't start the fire
It's been burning before we got here
Hey now
We ain't bring the lighting
It's been raining before you got here

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
We ain't your excuse
Don't blame us on the news
You taught us how to hate
When you took our love away

[Drop]
Yeah
I love the way
Yeah
See you taught me how to kill a man
When you took our love away

[Post-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Hey
I love you, I want you, I need you, I hate you
Protect you, then kill you
You feed me, then clothe me
Turn around and disown me
You bind me, disarm me
When you took our love away
Yeah
I love the way
Yeah
See you taught me how to kill a man
When you took our love away
Hey

[Bridge]
And that's the earthquake
We're gon' forget Haiti, Miami
