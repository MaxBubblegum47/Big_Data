[Verse 1]
Step out into the dawn
You pray ’til, you pray ’til the lights come on
And don’t you feel like you’ve just been born?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you come to raise me up
When I’m beaten and broken up
And I’m back in the arms I love

[Chorus]
And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died
I think I just died
And went to heaven
And went to heaven
And went to heaven

[Bridge]
It’s such a night, such a beautiful night
It’s such a beaut’, such a beautiful sight
I think I just, oh, I think I just died
And went to heaven
And went to heaven

[Verse 2]
We’re go be birds, we’ll fly
We’ll go, set the world alight
We’re gonna lose ourselves tonight
We’re go be birds, we’ll fly
We’ll go, set the world alight
We’re gonna lose ourselves tonight

[Outro]
Heaven
