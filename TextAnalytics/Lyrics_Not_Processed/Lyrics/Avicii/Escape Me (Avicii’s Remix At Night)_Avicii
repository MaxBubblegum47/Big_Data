I don't want him tonight
I don't wanna be cruel
I don't wanna deny
Failure is my favorite thing

Take me to the bar
Drink up to sorrow
Sorrow for break up
Borrow who you are

Indesecion is annoying not
As annoying as
Your sharp tounge

Pierce my lips
Don't shred me down to strips
You're way to good at it
You're way to good at it

Escape me
Escape me
Bottles under tires
Forget about friends

Escape me
Escape me
Black out tendencies
Forget about the future

Ooohhh(x4)

Back at the bar
Drunk on my sorrow
From another breakup
Forgetting who you were

Indesecion is annoying not
As annoying as
Your sharp tounge

Escape me
Escape me
Bottles under tires
Forget about friends

Escape me
Escape me
Black out tendencies
For-
Get about the future

Oooohhh

Pretty things ooohhh
Everything ooohhh
Pretty things

Pierce my lips
Don't shread me down to strips
You're way to good at it
You're way to good at it

Escape me
Escape me
Bottles under tires
Forget about friends

Escape me
Escape me
Black out tendencies
For-
Get about the future
