[Verse 1]
That's me right there on the corner
Listening to Wu in my Walkman
Neon lights at the water, reflecting the city I'm lost in
That's me right there on the corner
I one day would be leaving
For a dream that I didn't have
That I'd one day would believe in
Strange how the same place I ran from
Is the same place I think of whenever the chance comes
It's inevitable, ‘cause wherever I go…

[Chorus]
I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

[Verse 2]
I'm from a place where we never openly show our emotions
We drown our sorrows in bottomless bottles
And leave them to float in the ocean
I'm from a place where we never
Separate people from people
Some generalize, but in general I
Still believe that we are treated as equals
My father, my mother, my sister
My brother, my friends and my family's there
My hope and my money, my innocence in a sense
Almost lost everything here
Right where I was founded
Is right where I'll be found dead
The streets of my backbone, until I get back home

[Chorus]
I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

[Verse 3]
I'm not alone, I am the fire that burns
Not of the city but out of the 'burbs
A river that's just dying of thirst
I am a reverend lying in church
A crack in the pattern, a miracle waiting to happen
A promise that never was kept
One of those moments you'll never forget
I am that feeling inside
The one we all know but can't really describe
I am the blood spill, but I'm in love still

[Bridge]
Somewhere in Stockholm
But I'm not alone
Don't have to get by on my own
I'm finally home
Hemma i Stockholm
Där jag hör hemma

[Chorus]
I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm
