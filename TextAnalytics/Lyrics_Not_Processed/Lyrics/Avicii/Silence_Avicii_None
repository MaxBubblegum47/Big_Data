[Verse 1]
You only love me in bits and pieces
I keep on working, you keep your secrets
That's not an insult, that's not a lie
That's just a statement proven by time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause even when I have you, I don't really have you
I am not your last dude, where'd you get this attitude?
Talkin' 'bout you're leavin' cause you don't believe in
Me and all my reasons, left me with these demons
And this little pen, and this nostalgic feeling
Won't leave me alone
I'm faking all my smiles

[Chorus]
And you're just killing me with silence
And you're just killing me with time
I don't know where to put my sorrys
You're running laps around my mind
How could you leave me on this tightrope?
And I feel nothing when it storms
You know you're killing me with silence
You hold your halo up with horns
You hold your halo up with horns

[Verse 2]
You know you're clever, I'll give you that
You gave me heaven then took it back
That's not an insult, that's just the case
You've had that damn mask on for so damn long that everybody thinks it's your face

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But back beneath my eyelids I can hear the silence
Spreading like a virus while you wear disguises
Why you have to cut me then act like it's nothing?
This time I'm not bluffing, how you know I'm bluffing
Every single time
Your wicked little mind
It gets inside my head
And I can fake a smile

[Chorus]
But you're just killing me with silence
But you're just killing me with time
I don't know where to put my sorrys
You're running laps around my mind
How could you leave me on this tightrope?
And I feel nothing when it storms
You know you're killing me with silence
You hold your halo up with horns
You hold your halo up with horns

[Post-Chorus]
Ho-o-o-rns
(You)
Ho-o-o-rns
(Oh Lord)
Ho-o-o-rns
(Whooo-oh-oh)
Ho-o-o-rns
You hold your halo up with horns
Ho-o-o-orns
Ho-o-o-rns
(Oh no, no, no)
Ho-o-o-orns
You hold your, you hold your, you hold your
Ho-o-o-orns
You hold your, you hold your, you hold your
Ho-o-o-orns
And you're just killing me with silence
