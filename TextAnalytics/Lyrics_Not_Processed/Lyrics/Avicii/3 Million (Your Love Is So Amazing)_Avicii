Don't wanna let you go, I'm staying here by your side
Wish time was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes and let this night pass me by
Won't let it pass me by
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever, be apart never
That's alright with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing

[Instrumental]
Don't wanna let you go, I'm staying here by your side
Wish time was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes and let this night pass me by
Won't let it pass me by
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever, be apart never
That's alright with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing
