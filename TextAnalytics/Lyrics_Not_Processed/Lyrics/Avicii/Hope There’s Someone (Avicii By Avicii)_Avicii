[Verse 1]
Hope there's someone who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?
And hope there's someone who'll set my heart free
Rest alone when I'm tired

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed
How will I fall asleep tonight?
How will I rest my head?

[Chorus]
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed

[Verse 1]
Oh I’m scared of that middle place
Between light and nowhere
I don’t want to be the one
Left in there, left in there

[Pre-Chorus]
Then there’s a man on the horizon
Wish that I’d go to bed
And if I fall to his feet tonight
Will allow rest my head

[Chorus]
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed
