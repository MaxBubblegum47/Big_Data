[Verse 1]
Hey brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister
Know the lie is sweet but blood is thicker [?]

Oh, when the lie is heart on my sleeve, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

What if I'm far from home?
Oh, brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose all?
Oh, brother, I will help you out
When the lie is hard on my sleeve for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey brother
There's an endless road to re-discover
Hey sister
Know the lie is sweet but blood is thicker [?]

Oh, when the lie is heart on my sleeve for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
