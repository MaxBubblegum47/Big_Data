All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life I've been blind I've been taught by greed
Ohh Lord, what's wrong, what's wrong with me?
Ohh Lord, but that is all I see
All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life I've been blind I've been taught by greed
Ohh Lord, what's wrong, what's wrong with me?
Ohh Lord, but that is all I see
All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life I've been blind I've been taught by greed
Ohh Lord, what's wrong, what's wrong with me?
Ohh Lord, but that is all I see
