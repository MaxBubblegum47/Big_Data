[Intro]
This is how, that's how 
The Carnival
 began
Before I had a Fugee deal
I was signed to a house label under Craig Kallman
This is how, that's how 
The Carnival
 began
Before I had a Fugee deal
I was signed to a house label under Craig Kallman

[Verse 1]
R.I.P. to the legend Heavy D
I was barely seventeen when I heard this beat (Ooh)
Up town when I used to shop at the mall
(Please listen to my demo)
Big beat, flex the chest
Random club to tell 'em how to heat
Used to creep with a fake ID
Like kids tryin' to get into CVG
Jersey house, Zanzibar
Club Eighty-Eight, Garden State
Used to break, pop that lock
I wish we found love before my man got shot

[Chorus]
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do?) With it
(What are we gonna do with it?)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
With it
(Now that we found love)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do?) With it
(What are we gonna do with it?)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
With it
(Now that we found love)

[Verse 2]
It's [?] try to do the right thing
Touch my box radio right here
Can't live without the music
Like you can't live without your iPhone
Every minute, every second
Gotta send a text
Well, I gotta send a cock
To my people in the box
Everything gonna be all right, all right
Keep your head in the move
Five out of ten then you're coming home soon
What we gonna do when you get outta prison?
We gonna do a remix
Puff that dragon
And that's what I call love
Come on over, give me a bear hug

[Chorus]
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do?) With it
(What are we gonna do with it?)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
With it
(Now that we found love)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do?) With it
(What are we gonna do with it?)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
With it
(Now that we found love)

[Verse 3]
I got a five-piece band
And I'm back on the road
That's my DJ, go, go
Drummer man, keep it funky
Bass man, third world, Bob Marley
Shorty on the keys, man sound like Alicia
And my little sister wail like Aretha
Yeah, and when you see me at the live show
You better do the humpty-hump like Digital
Underground, two parks
I’m a Jonas brother
Hip house
This is those men that used to wear high tops
Who forfeit their rings and we met at the club spot

[Chorus]
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do?) With it
(What are we gonna do with it?)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
With it
(Now that we found love)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do?) With it
(What are we gonna do with it?)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
With it
(Now that we found love)
