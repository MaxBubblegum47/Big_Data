[Verse]
Yeah! Our story goes
He went down to the crossroads
He sat down and kept his eyes closed
Well, everyone has a price, child
And what it cost him
Was his soul

[Chorus]
You think you're getting away
No escape from the deal you made
You walked right into his plan
Run as fast as you think you can
Back from wherever you came
Call the devil by any name
Oh no! Now, who you do blame?
Should have listened to what I'd said
What I'd said, what I'd said, yeah!

[Hook]
I don't know if I'll be coming home again, home again
No, I don't know if I'll be coming home
It's a long road to hell without no soul

[Chorus Variation]
Just when you think you're getting away
No escape from the deal you made
You walked right into his plan
Run as fast as you think you can
Back from wherever you came
Call the devil by any name
Oh no! Now, who you do blame?
Should have listened to what I'd said
What I'd said, what I'd said, yeah!
Let me tell you it's a hard road to hell without no soul
