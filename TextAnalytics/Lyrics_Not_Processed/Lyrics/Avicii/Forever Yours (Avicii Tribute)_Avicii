[Verse 1]
Every time I see your face
There's a cloud hanging over you
In such a beautiful way
There's a poetry to your solitude

[Chorus]
Oh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forevermore
Oh, I've been thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours
Oh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forevermore
Oh, I've been thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours

[Verse 2]
And you won't ever have to try
To live by everybody else's rules
It'll be just you and I
Together in the altitude

[Chorus]
Oh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forevermore
Oh, I've been thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours
Oh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forevermore
Oh, I've been thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours

[Outro]
You should let me love ya, love ya
You should let me love ya, love ya
