[Intro]
Ok, number seven!

[Hook: Sterling Fox]
Shame on me for loving you
Can't deny that you've been untrue
You lie so sweet but you love to tease
Putting out fire with your gasoline
Woah! Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I'm baptized and born again
You can go to hell with your fucked-up friends
Crazy little bitch in the first degree
Shame on you for loving me
Yeah! Woah!

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Sterling Fox & Audra Mae]
(Oh, my, my!) That's what I get for loving you
(Lie, lie, lie!) You know I can't live without you
(Why, why, why?) And all the things you put me through
(Cry, cry, cry!) 'Cause I'll get my kicks without you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse: Sterling Fox]
That's what I get for loving you
Oh I can't live without you
That's what I get for loving you
Oh I can't live without you

[Hook 2: Audra Mae]
Shame on me for loving you
But you can't deny that you've been untrue
You lie so sweet but you love to tease
Putting out fire with your gasoline
Uh-dut-dut-dut, dut-up!
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Are you baptized and born again?
I'mma raise hell to the bitter end
I'm a crazy little bitch in the first degree
Shame on you for loving me
Ha!
Yeah, yeah yeah!
Uh, uh, uh!

[Chorus: Sterling Fox & Audra Mae]
(Oh, my, my!) That's what I get for loving you
(Lie, lie, lie!) You know I can't live without you
(Why, why, why?) And all the things you put me through
(Cry, cry, cry!) 'Cause I'll get my kicks without you

[Post-Chorus Sterling Fox]
And I believed in you and I-
Believed in you and you

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
That's what I get for loving you
