[Verse]
I think ways have hurt you
You came to my rescue
This will be a fine morning
The mighty old high I’m calling
Then I came to see
You bring out the best in me
Talk about a fine morning
The mighty old high I’m calling

[Pre Chorus]
A gift on a rainy day
Is something to believe in
That's the beauty of it all
And all because of you

[Chorus]
Hey!, I will prowl
Oh, I will prowl
Baby I'll learn to swim in my crocodile tears
I'm gonna feel it
And I got a feeling
Change gon' come to wipe my crocodile tears a-way

[Post-Chorus]
You wipe my crocodile tears a-way
You wipe my crocodile tears a-way

[Verse]
I think ways have hurt you
You came to my rescue
This will be a fine morning
The mighty old high I’m calling
Then I came to see
You bring out the best in me
Talk about a fine morning
The mighty old high I’m calling

[Pre Chorus]
A gift on a rainy day
Is something to believe in
That's the beauty of it all
And all because of you

[Chorus]
Hey!, I will prowl
Oh, I will prowl
Baby I'll learn to swim in my crocodile tears
I'm gonna feel it
And I got a feeling
Change gon' come to wipe my crocodile tears a-way

[Post-Chorus]
You wipe my crocodile tears a-way
You wipe my crocodile tears a-way
