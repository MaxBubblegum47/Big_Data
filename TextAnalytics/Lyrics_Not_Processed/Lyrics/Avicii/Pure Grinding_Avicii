[Chorus: Kristoffer Fogelmark]
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough

[Verse 1: Earl St. Clair]
Started out with nothing and I still got most of that
The world ain't give me much, I'm positive that's a fact
Everybody said be cool, you be payin' your dues
Make a long story short, I got nothin' to lose

[Pre-Chorus: Earl St. Clair]
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Kristoffer Fogelmark]
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough

[Verse 2: Earl St. Clair]
Try to make a dollar out of 15 cents
But I ain't understand how the money was spent
My mama told me, "Boy you ain't got no sense
If we put it all together can we pay this rent?"
I've been some places
Places I never should've been
I caught some changes
Changes that made me who I am

[Pre-Chorus: Earl St. Clair]
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'

[Chorus: Kristoffer Fogelmark]
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough
