Press play, fast forward
Non stop we have the beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the sunshine
We will never get back to
To the old school
To the old rounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world know all abouts
(We are the future and we're here to stay)
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
Straight ahead on the path we have before us
Day by day, soon the change will come
Don't you know we took a big step forward
Just lead the way and we pull the trigger
And we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world know all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back,  look back at the faded silhouette
