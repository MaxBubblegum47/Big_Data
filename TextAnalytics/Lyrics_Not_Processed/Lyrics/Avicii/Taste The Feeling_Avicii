[Verse 1]
It feels good, in my heart, in my soul
When you're right here beside me
I don't ever want this day to end
Mmm, we can watch the waves, have a Coke
And you sit here beside me
Take a little of my heart again

[Pre-Chorus]
So we can feel, forever, yeah feel, together be real, together and....

[Chorus]
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
You make it easier to sing
You make it easier to sing

[Verse 2]
Mmm, it feels good as we stand on the shore and our hearts are still jumping
Grab another Coke and let's dive in
O-o-oh, my love, there's song in my soul when you are around me
You make it easier to sing, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So we can feel, forever, yeah feel, together be real, together and....

[Chorus]
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

[Bridge]
With every fading sunset
We see the stars all night
You make the simple moments
Last for a life time
So we'll feel forever
You and me together
We can stay forever
And be real together

[Chorus]
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
You make it easier to sing
You make it easier to sing
