[Verse 1: Wayne Hector]
Woo
I've been fighting too many wars
Lady Luck please take me, I'm yours
I've been losing, who's keeping score?
'Cause I know we've all been here before, yeah
Give me good times 'fore they're all gone
Love me, fool me, don't leave me alone
All this time I've been rolling my stone
And I still haven't found my way home
But I know I'll be free, yeah, I know I'll be me again

[Verse 2: Sarah Blackwood]
Now the tides will carry you away from me
But they can't last forever
All the time that I been feeling lost at sea
I still haven't found my way home
But you're a star that I will follow where you lead
'Cause we belong together
When the tides take me back where I used to be
But I know I'll be free and I know I'll be me again

[Chorus: Wayne Hector]
Free again
I keep this fire burning my soul
Leave it running out of control
'Til you're broken you don't know when you're whole
Still tryna find my way home
But I know I'll be free, yeah, I know I'll be me again

[Post-Chorus: Wayne Hector & Sarah Blackwood]
And now the tides will carry you away from me
But they can't last forever
All the time that I've been feeling lost at sea
I still haven't found my way home
But you're a star that I will follow where you lead
'Cause we belong together
When the tides take me back where I used to be
But I know I'll be free and I know I'll be me again
