I've been watching you, I like those little moves you make
Said I'm feeling you, tell me, are you feeling me too?
I'd like to know your name but I'm so scared
Afraid of what you might say
But if I don't ever see you again, can't let you just walk away

Now you're approaching me, excuse me, can I know your name?
Took the opportunity, and now we're standing here face to face

It's amazing that you're so beautiful, tell me, are you really real?
And you say you wanna see me again, you have been watchin' me too
I'm so excited, excited, excited, excited
