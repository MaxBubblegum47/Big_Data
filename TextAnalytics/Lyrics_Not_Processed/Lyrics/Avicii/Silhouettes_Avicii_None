[Verse 1]
Press play, fast forward
Nonstop, we have a beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the signs

[Pre-Chorus]
So we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world knew all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

[Chorus]
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back at the faded silhouette

[Beat Break]

[Verse 2]
Straight ahead on the path we have before us
Day by day, soon the change will come
Don't you know we took a big step forward
Just lead the way and we pull the trigger

[Pre-Chorus]
And we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world knew all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

[Chorus]
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back at the faded silhouette

[Beat Break]
