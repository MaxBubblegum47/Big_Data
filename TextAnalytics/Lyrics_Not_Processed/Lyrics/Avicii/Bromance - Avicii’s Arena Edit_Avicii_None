I've been watching you
You've been hurting too
You give all your love
Nothing left to show
I have been there too
Alone in my despair
Watching life go by
No one who to share
Boy you got it bad
But I got something good
I want you good in every way yeah
You will never feel alone
My touch is such a rush
It over flows

Chorus:
I will give to you the love you seek
And more
So what are you waiting for
I will give to you
The love you seek and more
X3
Baby here we are
Standing face to face
Just the two of us
Locked in your embrace
Now i got it bad
But you got something good
Won't you treat me good
In every way
Yeah
Are you ready
I can feel your passion
And your love
It over flows
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for
I will give to you the love you seek and more
Ive got the love you seek x3
Ive got the love
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for
I will give to you the love you seek and more
X2
