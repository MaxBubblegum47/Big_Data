[Verse 1: Avicii]
I wasn't always the brightest
Until I learned how to dance
You got me thinking
Love will come around but you
Never gave me a chance

[Verse 2: Avicii]
I might not been the tallest
Until I learned how to jump
You got me thinking
Love will come around but you
Never say I'm the one

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
If I could make you, make you fall in love with me
If I could make you, make you fall in love
Wish I could make you, make you fall in love
Maybe love will come around, if you want it enough
Maybe love will come around, if you want it enough

[Post-Chorus]
Love will come around
Maybe love will come around for us

[Verse 3: Avicii]
I wasn't always the bravest
They say you only live once
So you got me thinking
I'm so glad I found ya
Life's what you make it, so here it comes

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
If I could make you, make you fall in love with me
If I could make you, make you fall in love
Wish I could make you, make you fall in love
Maybe love will come around, if you want it enough
Maybe love will come around, if you want it enough

[Outro: Avicii]
If you're a true believer
If you're a true believer
Love will come around, love will come around for us
