[Verse 1]
Feels like I've been waiting so long for tonight
'Cause I just can't get you out of my mind
Can you feel my heart's beating so fast?
Now you're here, know there's no turning back

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I think I'm falling
Can't hold on no more
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
Just gotta let go
And as my grip unwinds
I feel your hand in mine
No, I've never felt, never felt like this before

[Chorus]
Come on babe, don't give up on us (don't give up on us)
Choose me and I'll show you love (and I'll show you love)
Let me show you love
Let me show you love (let me show you)
Let me show you love
Let me show you love (let me show you)
Let me show you

[Verse 2]
If you call, I'll be there at your side
If you're lost, I'll be there shining my light
'Cause every touch lifts me up to the stars
'Cause nothing could ever keep us apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I think I'm falling
Can't hold on no more
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
Just gotta let go
And as my grip unwinds
I feel your hand in mine
No, I've never felt, never felt like this before
