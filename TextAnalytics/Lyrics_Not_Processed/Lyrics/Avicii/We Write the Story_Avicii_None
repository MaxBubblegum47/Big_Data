[Chorus 1]
Justice and peace and liberty
We write the story
We can fulfill the legacy
We write the song
Welcome a new enlightenment
We write the story
We can recast and reinvent
We write the song

[Verse]
We are humans
Born free and equal
On this one earth lies our future
We are humans (we write the story, we write the song)
Reason and conscience (we write the story, we write the song)
May they rule the world one day

[Chorus 2]
Justice and peace and liberty
We write the story
We can fulfill the legacy
We write the song
True to the ones who lit the light
We write the story
We have a torch to reignite
We write the song

[Chorus 3]
Welcome a new enlightenment
Welcome the glory
We can recast and reinvent
We can be strong
We have a choice in everything
We write the story
We have a voice and words to sing
We write the song

[Outro]
Free and equal (we write the story, we write the song)
Reason and conscience (we write the story, we write the song)
We are humans
We are one
