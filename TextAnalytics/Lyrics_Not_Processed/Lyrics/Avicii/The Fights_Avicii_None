On a day four years ago
Was stuck inside because of snow
And on a losing streak in CoD
(Hey!, Hey!)
When suddenly on MSN
My friend found a new game again
And was so nice to gift Minecraft to me
We started digging and mining
For the shiny stones, so blue
Through dirt and stone and passed some lava too
He taught me crafting
And brewing to make pots and stay alive
'Cause it is most important to survive
He said tonight a thousand mobs will rise
So guard your house and do remember
Don't go alone and make sure to light the skies
To honor does who died this fight
Avenge them for me!
To honor does who died this fight
Avenge them for me!
Almost all the town was killed
Though lots of zombie blood was spilled
My friend and I catch breath before wave Two
But with just two hearts left and out of food
We hear a crackle and a *whoosh sound*
A skeleton just shot him from behind
Before respawning, he said to me
“Don’t throw away your goals”
“Keep playing, go have fun, ignore the trolls”
“When you keep building,”
“Enchanting, your diamond sword to slay,”
“Get ready ‘cause you’re only half the way”
Because tonight a thousand mobs will rise
So guard your house, and do remember
Don’t go alone and make sure to light the skies
To honor those who died this fight
Avenge them for me!
To honor those who died this fight
Avenge them for me!
Avenge them for me!
Avenge them for me!
