I don't know just how it happened, I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
I wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your eyes
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing wave
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing though my veins
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you!
Midnight blows in through the window; dances round the room
Got me hypnotized; I'm getting high on the perfume
I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain!
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you!
