I feel weak, things get tough
Sometimes my knees can barely hold me up, yeah
I'm no fool, but it's said
That you gotta walk a mile to get outta my head
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life! Give a damn!
You gotta make a move to show where we can stand
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
I got the time, it'll be all right, yeah
I got the time that you need (yeah)
We all weep, bleed the same
If you get the picture, leave it out of the frame, yeah
In the now, take a chance
Make a mess, and don't forget that life is a dance
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life! Give a damn!
You gotta make a move to show where we can stand
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Lay me down in darkness (yeah)
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Ooh, babe show me, baby tell me that's me, yeah
I got the time, it'll be all right, yeah
I got the time that you need. Come on!
