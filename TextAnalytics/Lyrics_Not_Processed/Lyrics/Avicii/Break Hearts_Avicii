(And you don't know)
You've got me climbing up a mountain nowhere, baby
And swimming down an ocean of Hell
You've got me [ad-libbed lyrics]
(Ah, sorry, you can leave it going)
You've got me climbing up a mountain to nowhere
You've got me swimming in an ocean of Hell
You've got me [ad-libbed lyrics]
'Cause when you break hearts, you do it well

[Ad-libbed lyrics]
And if you cared about me, I couldn't tell
Somethin' bout you is [?] the devil
'Cause when you break hearts, you do it well
You do it well
You do it well
You do it well
You do it well
