[Verse]
Bang, what's that sound
Everybody run when the shots ring out
Oh, that's not right
[Ad-libbed lyrics] all night
Ay, that's okay
[Ad-libbed lyrics]
No, [Ad-libbed lyrics], why we know

[Pre-Chorus]
We're strugglin' just to try to make these ends meet
Job juggling, Lord hear my cry
I'm wonderin' why the TV turned my people
Ride for the money, die for the money
For a little food on my plate

[Chorus]
Give us freedom
For all our families
Give us freedom
Peace and harmony
That's the reason
We struggle everyday
For our freedom
And a little food on our plate
And we ride for the money, die for the money
For a little food on our plate
And we ride for the money, die for the money
And a little food on our plate, hey
