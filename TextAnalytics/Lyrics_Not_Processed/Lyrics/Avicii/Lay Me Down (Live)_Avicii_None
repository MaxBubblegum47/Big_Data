I feel weak, things get tough
Sometimes my knees can barely hold me up
I'm no fool, but it's said
You gotta walk a mile 'til you're outta my head
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Cast your light, give a damn
You gotta make a move and show me where we can stand
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Tell me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Tell me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
I got the time, it'll be alright, yeah, I got the time
That you need (Yeah)
We all weep, bleed the same
If you get the picture, leave it outta the frame
In the now, take a chance
Make a mess, and don't forget that life is a dance
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Cast your light, give a damn
You gotta make a move and show me where we can stand
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Lay me down in darkness (Yeah)
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one tell me I'm the one that you need
(Yeah)
Show me I'm the one tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one tell me I'm the one that you need
Mmmm-mmm me, show me baby baby tell me that's me, yeah
I got the time, it'll be alright, yeah
I got the time that you need. Come on!
