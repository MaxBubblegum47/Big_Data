[Verse 1: Tom Odell]
Remember all those nights
When all our neighbors could hear us sing
Remember all the fights
And all the makeups that they would bring

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Odell]
But now those days are gone
And summer's turned to fall
You know how much I know
But please I beg don't call

[Chorus: Tom Odell]
I'm trying to leave you alone
I've been dying to pick up the phone
Yeah, and around and around and they always go
And I can't love you again
I can't love you again

[Drop]

[Verse 2: Tom Odell]
Remember all those days
All those days we were drunk in love
Remember all those waves
All those waves we would sober up

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Odell]
But now those days are gone
And summer's turned to fall
Let's leave it in this song
So baby please I beg don't call

[Chorus: Tom Odell]
I'm trying to leave you alone
I've been dying to pick up the phone
Yeah, and around and around and they always go, yeah
I can't love you again

I'm trying to leave you alone
I've been dying, I know that you know
And around and around and they always go
And I can't love you again
I can't love you again
I can't love you again
I can't love you again
