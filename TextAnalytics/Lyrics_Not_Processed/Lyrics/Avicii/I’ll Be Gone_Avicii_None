[Verse]
I gave my world away
A million rainy days
Such a shame in a way
And no one else alive
Sacrificed everything
A million broken dreams
And I don't want to stay
I did it anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
The stars all rise
The moon won't shine
The stars fall out of the sky
And I could be your guiding light
All through the night
All through your life

[Chorus]
I'll be gone before you know it
Long, long, gone
[And now the world is spinning]
Like the sun
And now the day is burning
I don't mind
Spending some time on my own

[Instrumental]
