[Verse 1]
Round and round, it's all the same
On my chariot
Spelled in fire, I saw her name
Sophie carry us

[Chorus]
Yeah, you and me
Like a thousand years of reachin' for the light
Soar, we are free
In a dream I dreamed a thousand times tonight
Sophie and I, la la la la la la
Sophie and I

[Verse 2]
Round and round and round again
On my chariot
Came a fire to melt a man
Fall to marry us

[Chorus]
Yeah, you and me
Like a thousand years of reachin' for the light
Soar, we are free
In a dream I dreamed a thousand times tonight
Yeah, you and me
Like a thousand years of reachin' for the light
Sophie and I, la la la la la la
Sophie and I
