[Intro]
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you

[Hook]
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
Love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you

[Verse 1]
Miss days of her laughter
But I've turned another chapter
In the 6 with my Raptors
Went ghost, now you calling me Casper
Could it be, that it's not serious to me
I stay with these
Cause it hurt me way more to leave
Cutting ties after hot sex in the bathroom
Now that we're over I won't look at you
Feelings in my stomach like it's high school
I know there are other niggas looking at you
But you can't diss me on my set
You cuss me 'bout my text
Said it received, but not read
20 minutes later a paragraph or two

[Hook]
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
Love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you

[Verse 2]
Naked
Does he make love while you're naked?
Do you never let him taste it?
Does he fuck you like he loves you?
Treat you good like a man should
Does he bathe in the shower for you?
Does he do the things that I do?
Does he tell you that I want you?
I know how much I really love you
I can't-s put no one above you
I'm a lover man for you
You the down girl for me
Rolling blunts on your roof
Let my ex know about you
She can't do things you do
Inside and out the room
You're the only one that knew that

[Hook]
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
Love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
Love you

[Outro]
I was only tryin' to love you
And you knew that I wanna love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
