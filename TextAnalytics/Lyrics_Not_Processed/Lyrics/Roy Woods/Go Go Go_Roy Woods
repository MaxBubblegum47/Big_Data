[Verse 1]
I see how you change at night, nothing like your basement lies
Chevrolet trip half an hour ride,
take a nigga back to the Southside
I'm giving it all to you, naked and raw baby, raw as my heart
Feel the pain as it thumps
I feel used on my chest, it ain't nothing at all
Cause I'm here for you, I'm making love to you
You're letting it all go, go, go, go
I'm here for you, I'm making love to you

[Chorus]
You're letting it all go, go, go go
Let you're pain go, go, go, go
I let my pain go, go, go go
Let your pain go, go, go go
I let my pain go, go, go, go
Let your pain go, go, go go
I let my pain go, go, go, go
Let your pain go, go, go go

[Verse 2]
I need what I never had, you had, thought you had a spot
So show me what it is right now, girl yeah
Cause I been in the Lost and Found
And you are the only thing inside
Brand new heart is why I'm at the bonfire
Pick and choose what you need and who you want, girl I'm there
You can call on me when you know there's no one else
You got away, bet I'm down for the moment, shit
You the real shit, hold me down for a fucking spliff
Whenever I'm stressed (Whenever I'm stressed)
You hold me down the best
I see how you change at night
Nothing like your basement lies
Chevrolet trip half an hour ride
And take a nigga back to the Southside

[Chorus]
You're letting it all go, go, go, go
Let you're pain go, go, go, go
I let my pain go, go, go go
Let your pain go, go, go go
I let my pain go, go, go, go
Let your pain go, go, go go
I let my pain go, go, go, go
Let your pain go, go, go go
