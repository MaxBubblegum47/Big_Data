[Verse 1: Roy Woods]
This time's not done, but I'm drinking now
Unless they find ya', intertwine with me
 (oh baby)
She don't like what's she's forced to see (She don't like what's she's forced to see)
But I could've got started on her (But I could've got started on her)
She knows what I'm putting on her
 (She knows what I'm putting on her)
Girl I stay high, never sober (Girl I stay high, never sober)
You could have stayed but it's over (You could have stayed but it's over)

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Cause you're so jealous of me (so jealous of me)
Oh you're so jealous of me, jealousy over me
(Why you so jealous, how you so jealous?) Over me
(Why you catchin' feelings, how you catchin' feelings?) Jealousy over me
(Why you so jealous, how you so jealous?) Over me
(Why you catchin' feelings, how you catchin' feelings?) Jealousy over
(Why you so jealous, how you so jealous?) Over me
(Why you catchin' feelings, how you catchin' feelings?) Jealousy over me
(Why you so jealous, how you so jealous?) Jealousy over me
Jealousy over me (Why you catchin' feelings)

[Verse 2: Roy Woods]
I been runnin' the stage, you cannot tell me I am fake
My main girl still the realest shit, love me when they say I ain't shit
She gon' spend her cash when I'm broke
She gon' whip through the six and more
'Member the days we ain't had no home?
Oh mom, I gotta show these niggas what's good (whats up)
Mama, there ain't no bringin' me down
Soldier in this bitch, I'm gunnin' them down
King with no crown, they still gon' look at me now (yeah, yeah)
I been too drunk, I'm way too fucked
How you think I'm singing this shit my dog
I am not normal, you do not know what I'm on
My name called up in the party, you know
I been turnt up in the club in the max
This is my life nigga you don't forget

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Jealous of me, jealousy over me
(Why you so jealous, how you so jealous?) Over me
(Why you catchin' feelings, how you catchin' feelings?) Jealousy over me
(Why you so jealous, how you so jealous?) Over me
(Why you catchin' feelings, how you catchin' feelings?) Jealousy over me
(Why you so jealous, how you so jealous?) Over me
(Why you catchin' feelings, how you catchin' feelings?) Jealousy over me
(Why you so jealous, how you so jealous?) Jealousy over me
Jealousy over

[Outro: Roy Woods]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Why you catching feelings, how you gettin' jealous?
