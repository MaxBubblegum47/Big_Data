[Verse 1]
Bump me when you drive by
We'll get high, 427 in the night
Show off when you wanna, babe
I hope you know it' alright, I don't mind
Shawty, show me your thighs, don't be shy, baby
Don’t ride, I’ll lotion you down
Or would you rather oil me?
It’s smoother when you ride
Fall in my arms girl wake up to me
Let's sleep with no clothes again
Am I talking through you as you're starin' through me
What's with all our lies again?

[Chorus]
But this time I wanna know why, I can't sleep without you to my right
But this time I wanna know why, I can't sleep without you to my right

(Harmonizing)

[Post-Chorus]
Put me to sleep with your voice, babe
Don't leave me with the choice, babe
Oh please, I don't need no extra love off of you

[Verse 2]
You can't run outta love
There is nothin' that's too much
Can you take me real far? Take me the whole way, baby
Grab my hands, don't lose faith, I have so much in you
I know when to give you space
'Cause I know, know, know that I mess up
Got you feelin' like you're 'bout throw a left hook
I throw my hook into your sea while it's floodin' my bed
They have done so much to me, but can't throw off my head
I'm so sorry that you didn't see the love I have
Oh well, guess we're better off
Only the thoughts confuse all the months
Know I was late showin' up to prom, but I show you later
Surprise in a box

[Chorus]
But this time I wanna know why, I can't sleep without you to my right
But this time I wanna know why, I can't sleep without you to my right

(Harmonizing)

[Outro]
I'm sorry for so much, I'm sorry for so much
I'm sorry for so much, I'm sorry for so much
I'm sorry for so much, I'm sorry for so much
I'm sorry for so much, I'm sorry for so much
Too much, I’ve done
You didn’t need to see that
Woah, it sounds bad that’s why
