[Verse 1]
It started with a low light
Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess that changed my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
That was the turning point
That was one lonely night

[Chorus]
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"

[Verse 2]
Well now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You'd better look it over
Before you make that leap

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I’m fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
They justify my claim
And the public don’t dwell on
My transmission ‘cause it wasn’t televised
But it was the turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

[Chorus]
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"

[Bridge]
My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from East to West
They say the Nile used to run
From East to West

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes

[Chorus]
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"

[Outro]
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
