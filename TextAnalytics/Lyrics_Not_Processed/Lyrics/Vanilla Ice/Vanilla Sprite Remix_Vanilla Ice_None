[Verse 1 - Rick Ross}

[Verse 2 - Forgiato Blow}
Here's a little something that you need to know
How I went from lil Kurt to Forgiato Blow
Used to get picked on cause my people had dough
Now I got it on my own, I'm just letting it show
Used to be the black sheep of my fam
I left the past in the past and I let that shit go
I remember when I used to keep my beard real low
Had to Ross up on her so I let my shit grow
Had to boss up on em, went and got me a Ghost
Not lyin' but for real that's my number one goal
That's the reason why I rap, so you can keep the plaques
I just need it all white, want my rims to match
Now I'm glad that I got the party jumpin
But if anybody step on my Nike's, be bumpin'
And security's my cousin
So I paid him twenty dollars and he let me bring my gun in

[Verse 3 - Vanilla Ice}
Boom - whatcha gonna do now?
Vanilla Ice in the mix, thought you knew now (wat?)
Mad cribs, money stacks - yo I still got 'em
Fancy ships, candy tracks - yo I still cop 'em
Platinum flows filled with facts - yo I still drop 'em
Your favorite rapper ain't V-Ice? Yo - I still top 'em
Got a sold out world tour - no stoppin'
Go to Tiffany's and do a little shopping, huh
I like to go fast anywhere in my Lamborghini
Old School like Knight Rider, Good Times, I Dream of Jeannie
Electrifying the red carpet - y'all know
Call me Madden cause my game is rocking them shows
The industry should call me Stomp - I'm stepping on them toes
Build another crib by the ocean I suppose
This ain't no dream, I just get it how I live it
(Alright stop!) - That's how it goes
