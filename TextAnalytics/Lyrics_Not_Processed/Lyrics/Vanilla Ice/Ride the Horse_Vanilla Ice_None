[Chorus: Forgiato Blow]
Country girls, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
Cowboys, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
City slicker, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
Everybody in the party do your days (Hey)
Put your left foot and pull it out, won't ya (Hey)
Stick your right foot and pull it out, won't ya (Hey)
Ride the horse, ride the horse, ride the horse now (Hey)
Ride the horse, ride the horse, ride the horse now (Hey)

[Verse 1: Vanilla Ice]
Ride the horse, ride the horse, ride the pony
Saddle up, baby, go wild on this donkey
That's my girl, she my one, she my only
Ride or die, yeah, my female, homie
She drives a race car and a big truck
Lift kit big, wheels never get stuck
Skinny tight jeans and her boots on
Sendin' pheromones, my girl horny like a nympho
Cinco de Mayo, 1942 Don Julio
I go, wherever you go, baby, you know
Me an' you, now let's go, come on

[Chorus: Forgiato Blow]
Country girls, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
Cowboys, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
City slicker, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
Everybody in the party do your days (Hey)
Put your left foot and pull it out, won't ya (Hey)
Stick your right foot and pull it out, won't ya (Hey)
Ride the horse, ride the horse, ride the horse now (Hey)
Ride the horse, ride the horse, ride the horse now (Hey)

[Verse 2: Forgiato Blow]
Urban cowboy sold to the woman in the front row
Saddle [?] we on the radio
Two-step to a new step, keep it on the line
Whiskey drinking with them dixie chicks on the county line
Booty shaking southern bells on the hideaway highway
Country creek boy sitting sideways
Judy trucks got her hips on fire
Doing the dance, wearing the tread upon my tires
You can find me at the redneck yacht club (Hey)
Sugarland moonshine in my red cup (Hey)
Daisy dukes should've outlawed denim
The way she shakin' on me, you know I'mma have to skin her

[Chorus: Forgiato Blow]
Country girls, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
Cowboys, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
City slicker, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
Everybody in the party do your days (Hey)
Put your left foot and pull it out, won't ya (Hey)
Stick your right foot and pull it out, won't ya (Hey)
Ride the horse, ride the horse, ride the horse now (Hey)
Ride the horse, ride the horse, ride the horse now (Hey)

[Verse 3: Cowboy Troy]
Bubble butts in the bubble up
All the pretty kins with the booty stars
Wishing when the be sin
Used to be chillin'
Cowboy hats got most struttin' round like they’re Marshal Dillon
It's like a scene from "Urban cowboy" in the 80’s
The crew is too busy staring at the ladies
Mumblin' [?]  denim?
Trying the best tryin' to get what's in 'em
All the ladies just tryna do the get-up
Bassline hits and the whole crowd lit up
Tryin' not to spill your white claw

[?]

[Chorus: Forgiato Blow]
Country girls, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
Cowboys, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
City slicker, yeah, gon' do your days (Hey)
Everybody in the party do your days (Hey)
Put your left foot and pull it out, won't ya (Hey)
Stick your right foot and pull it out, won't ya (Hey)
Ride the horse, ride the horse, ride the horse now (Hey)
Ride the horse, ride the horse, ride the horse now (Hey)
