[Hook]
Shi-Shining like I'm Megaman, I smoke mega, man (uh)
Don't come at the youth, send you back to where you came from
Niggas quick to change, uh, y'all some Bruce Wayne, uh
If he act mysterious he get hit with my ray (pew, pew, pew)
Shining like I'm Megaman, I smoke mega, man
Don't come at the youth, send you back to where you came from
Niggas quick to change, uh, y'all some Bruce Wayne
If he act mysterious he get hit with my ray

[Verse]
And if you was curious, yes, I'm Tay-K
I'm not on time with everything but, bitch, it's worth the wait
I look at your gang, get my 40 and I aim
Marks on his head, now he looking like Aang
Don't come at the youth, send you back to where you came
I don't wanna smooch, bitch, I really want the brain (yah)
I just hit a stain now your bitch wanna claim (Me)
Just opened up your pack and it better be stank, nigga

[Hook]
Shi-Shining like I'm Megaman, I smoke mega, man (uh)
Don't come at the youth, send you back to where you came from
Niggas quick to change, uh, y'all some Bruce Wayne, uh
If he act mysterious he get hit with my ray (pew, pew, pew)
Shining like I'm Megaman, I smoke mega, man
Don't come at the youth, send you back to where you came from
Niggas quick to change, uh, y'all some Bruce Wayne
If he act mysterious he get hit with my ray

[Outro]
Like I'm Megaman, I smoke mega, man
Don't come at the youth, send you back to where you came
Niggas quick to change, uh, y'all some Bruce Wayne
If he act mysterious, he get hit with the ray
Shining like I'm Megaman, I smoke mega, man
Don't come at the youth...
