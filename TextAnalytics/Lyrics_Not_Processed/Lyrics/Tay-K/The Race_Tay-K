[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action (Gang, gang)
You want action, you get turned into past tense (In the past)
Your boys deep? Well, let's get to subtractin' (Bah, bah)
Smith & Wesson made my 9 with sub-compaction (Skrrt)

[Chorus]
Fu-fu-fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case (Gang, gang)
But I ain't beat that case, bitch, I did the race (Skrrt, skrrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face (Lil bitch)
Eli Blast crackin' 4s like a vase (Gang)
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (Skrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Ro-ro-rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace (Gimme that shit, nigga)
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face

[Verse]
Pimp gon' be eatin' good noodles every day (Free Pimp)
Bitch, I'm drawin' doodles, Tay-K, paint the way (You're a simp)
Choppa tear your dudies into fish fillet (Lil bitch)
I-I-I woke up too moody, who gon' die today? (Skrrt)
Shoot a fuckboy in his mothafuckin' face (Grrah, grrah)
We-we-we cookin' up, boy, you don't wanna go dat way (Dat way, dat way)
Gotta go dat way, you get robbed for your rackades (Rackades, rackades)
Gotta go dat way, boy, you not gon' be happy (Hahaha)
I-I-I tote 50s, I'm a shooter like Young Pappy (Pew)
Bitch try to rob, we make her dance, Michael Jackson (Skrrt)
We was plottin', y'all was tryna get the pack in (Lil bitch)
Get the pack in, you get robbed for a fraction (Gimme that shit)

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action
You want action, you get turned into past tense
Your boys deep? Well, let's get to subtractin'
Smith & Wesson made my 9 with sub-compaction

[Chorus]
Fu-fu-fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch, I did the race (Skrrt, skrrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face (Gang, gang)
Eli Blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (Grra, grra)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Ro-ro-rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace (Gimme that shit, nigga)
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face
Fu-fu-fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case (Gang, gang)
But I ain't beat that case, bitch, I did the race (Skrrt, skrrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face (Lil bitch)
Eli Blast crackin' 4s like a vase (Gang)
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (Skrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Ro-ro-rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace (Gimme that shit, nigga)
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face

[Outro]
See it in my mothafuckin' face
