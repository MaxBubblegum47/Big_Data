[Verse 1]
Maybe I should sell this truck
I'm thinking it's about that time
Cause every time I climb on up
I see you sitting on the other side
You're putting your make-up on
Getting ready for a Friday night
Girl, I know you're really gone
But every time I close my eyes

[Chorus]
You're back in my passenger sear
Just like you were when you rode with me
Feet out the window
Floating on the breeze
My little shotgun queen
Smiling back at me
No, it wasn't that long ago
We were revving and loving
On an old backroad
Holding you in the moonlight
Kissing goodnight
Every other memory
Girl, you're back in my passenger seat

[Verse 2]
When the sun hits his windshield
Does he see your little bitty toe prints?
Do you listen to the same old songs?
Do you sing along like we did?
Does he let you roll the windows down?
Keep your shades in the center console?
Well, girl if he don't
Then pick up the phone
I'll pick you up in a minute or so

[Chorus]
Come on and climb in my passenger seat
Just like you were when you rode with me
Feet out the window
Floating on the breeze
My little shotgun queen
Smiling back at me
No, it wasn't that long ago
We were revving and loving
On an old backroad
Holding you in the moonlight
Kissing goodnight
Every other memory
You're back in my passenger seat

[Bridge]
Girl you looked so happy
When you rode past me
Out on the town tonight
Your eyes were shining
You were smiling
At the guy on the drivers side
Yeah, it kinda looked like

[Chorus]
When you were in my passenger sear
Back in the day when you rode with me
Feet out the window
Floating on the breeze
My little shotgun queen
Smiling back at me
No, it wasn't that long ago
We were revving and loving
On an old backroad
Holding you in the moonlight
Kissing goodnight
Every other memory
Girl, you're back in my passenger seat
Oh, but you ain't in my passenger seat

[Verse 1]
Maybe I should sell this truck
I'm thinking it's about that time
