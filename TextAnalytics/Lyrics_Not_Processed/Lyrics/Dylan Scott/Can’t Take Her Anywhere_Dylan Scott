[Verse 1]
Hey man, I see you
Checking out my girl like I ain't got a clue
But I do, it's okay
It doesn't really matter, 'cause at the end of the day
She's mine, yeah, she's fine
This ain't the first time, and you ain't the first guy

[Chorus]
I can't take her anywhere without causing a scene
Everywhere we go, she got her own paparazzi
All the fellas gettin' jealous up in this bar
It's kinda like I got my own little superstar
Anywhere that she walks in
People stop and stare, but I don't care
'Cause I know that se's a beauty, such a cutey
Yeah, she don't try, even blows my mind
I can't take her anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, anywhere

[Verse 2]
I turn around, yeah, two shots of Crown
The boy thinks he's got a shot, but she's turning him down
And I laughed, she laughed
Laid a kiss on my lips, then sat in my lip
'Cause she's mine, yeah, she's fine
This ain't the first time, and he ain't the first guy

[Chorus]
I can't take her anywhere without causing a scene
Everywhere we go, she got her own paparazzi
All the fellas gettin' jealous up in this bar
It's kinda like I got my own little superstar
Anywhere that she walks in
People stop and stare, but I don't care
'Cause I know that se's a beauty, such a cutey
Yeah, she don't try, even blows my mind
I can't take her anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
I can't take her anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, anywhere

[Bridge]
She's like a spotlight, shining bright
Turns me on like a streetlight
At midnight, in the moonlight
Yeah, she's looking so right
She gets to me when she's next to me
It's hard to breathe, I can't beloeve she's mine

[Chorus]
I can't take her anywhere without causing a scene
Everywhere we go, she got her own paparazzi
All the fellas gettin' jealous up in this bar
It's kinda like I got my own little superstar
Anywhere that she walks in
People stop and stare, but I don't care
'Cause I know that se's a beauty, such a cutey
Yeah, she don't try, even blows my mind
I can't take her anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
I can't take her anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, anywhere

[Outro]
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
