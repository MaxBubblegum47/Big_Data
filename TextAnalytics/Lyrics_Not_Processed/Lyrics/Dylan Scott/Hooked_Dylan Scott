[Verse 1]
It was a Friday night
No cover but the cover band was sounding right
But there you were
Just flirty dancing
By the neon sign
To fishing in the dark and
Reeling in my heart
And I look where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm hooked on kissing and getting
Getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you
All night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and

[Chorus]
I was hooked on
The way that you taking
Taking my shirt off
And running my fingers
Through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked

[Verse 2]
It's Saturday
Still asleep and I could leave, but no way
This ain't a one night fling kinda thing
Wanna wake you up
Wanna press my luck
And my lips on your cheek
Like I can't enough cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm hooked on kissing and getting
Getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you
All night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and

[Chorus]
I was hooked on
The way that you taking
Taking my shirt off
And running my fingers
Through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm hooked on kissing and getting
Getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you
All night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and

[Chorus]
I was hooked on
The way that you taking
Taking my shirt off
And running my fingers
Through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked
