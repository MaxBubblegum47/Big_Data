[Verse 1]
You pulled the covers off the bed
Pillow stuck between your legs
Oh, what a beautiful mess
My t-shirts never looked so good
I'm laying here like I could stay here forever next to

[Chorus]
Sleeping Beauty
You got no idea what you do to me
I hope your dreams come true
Last night was perfect
We stayed up too late, but it was worth it
To wake up seeing you
Sleeping Beauty

[Verse 1]
The sun hurts coming through the blinds
I guess I poured us too much wine
Put the blame on me
No I ain't gonna wake you up
You don't need it, but go on
Get your beauty sleep

[Chorus]
Sleeping Beauty
You got no idea what you do to me
I hope your dreams come true
Last night was perfect
We stayed up too late, but it was worth it
To wake up seeing you
Sleeping Beauty

[Chorus]
Sleeping Beauty
You got no idea what you do to me
I hope your dreams come true
Last night was perfect
We stayed up too late, but it was worth it
To wake up seeing you
Oh, Sleeping Beauty
