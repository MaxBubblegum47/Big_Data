)
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (Jason Derulo)
Mmmm, that it's all for the best?
Of course, it is

[Verse 1]
I (I) was so wrong (Wrong) for so long (Long)
Only tryna please myself (Myself)
Girl, I (I) was caught up (Up) in her lust (Lust)
When I don't really want no one else, so no
I know I should have treated you better (Better)
But me and you were meant to last forever (Forever)
So let me in (let me in), give me another chance (Another chance)
To really be your man (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star, we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me, girl

[Chorus]
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (Whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmmm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (Whatcha say, whatcha say)
Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did you say?

[Verse 2]
How (How) could I live (Live) with myself (Self)
Knowing that I let our love go? (Love go)
And ooh (Ooh), what I'd do (Do) with one chance (Chance)
I just gotta let you know
I know what I did wasn't clever
But me and you we're meant to be together
So let me in (Let me in), give me another chance (Another chance)
To really be your man

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star, we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me, girl

[Chorus]
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (Whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmmm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (Whatcha say, whatcha say)
Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did you say?

[Bridge]
Girl, tell me what to say, I (say, I)
I don't want you to leave me, though you caught me cheating
Tell me, tell me what to say, I (say, I)
I really need you in my life 'cause things ain't right, girl
Girl, tell me what to say, I (say, I)
I don't want you to leave me, though you caught me cheating
Tell me, tell me what to say, I (say, I)
I really need you in my life 'cause things ain't right

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do (I just didn't know what to do)
But when I become a star we'll be living so large, I'll do anything for you
So baby, whatcha say

[Chorus]
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmmm, that you only meant well? (Well, of course I did, baby)
Well, of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (Whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmmm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is (Well, of course it is)
Mmmm, whatcha say (What did you say?)
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well of course you did (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)

Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did you say?
