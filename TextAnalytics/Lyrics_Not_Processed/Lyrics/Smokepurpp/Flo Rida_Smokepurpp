[Intro]
Whole lotta gang shit, yuh
Ayy, pew pew, a-gling-gling-gling
Dangerous huh, more dangerous
Know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: MaSiWei]
I'm drinkin' Evian when I wake up
Broke-ass bitches, I can't feel ya
You can blow my whistle like I'm Flo Rida
 (Rida)
Pretty momma on my dick do her yoga
I'm drinkin' Evian when I wake up (I wake up)
Yay, broke-ass bitches, I can't feel ya
 (Feel ya)
You can blow my whistle like I'm Flo Rida
 (Rida)
Pretty momma on my dick do her yoga

[Verse 1: DZ & MaSiWei]
每当门票全部sold out 我在欣赏money dance (Soda)
愿望清单全部勾了 need purple shit, drink soda (Soda)
LV包比Gucci的骚
 young daddy, young body, young boss (Huh)
打开笔记本电脑搜索 搜到higherganggang.com (Oh)
我吸引着女人的注意力 我活就没什么顾虑的
我成功是全靠我努力的 赚大钱所以遭到你妒忌
I'm just living life, I don’t really wanna go home (Life)
脖子上是谁的口红 you should call me on my cellphone (Ring ring)
Flexing time 脱个外套
你不看我的内在爱看外表
卡比兽是网友给我取的外号
一口气我可以喝光两个double cup (Oh)
Double star 调大我的音量开关 this shit so hot 再开瓶香槟
站在舞台上 yeah, I feel so great, I believe I can fly就像R. Kelly
 (Yeah)

[Chorus: MaSiWei]
I'm drinkin' Evian when I wake up (I wake up)
Yay, broke-ass bitches, I can't feel ya
 (I can feel ya)
You can blow my whistle like I'm Flo Rida
 (Rida)
Pretty momma on my dick do her yoga

[Verse 2: Psy.P & Melo]
傲慢又自负 零下六十度 (Ayy, ayy)
感受不到温度的我内心很冷酷
就像苏马赫开F1没发生过失误
上电视节目 一直到结束
Nobody can fuck with me 耍嘴皮 (Ayy)
毫不费力就能把你击毙
我出生在天堂却一直生活在地狱
人民币和美金放到银行收利息
Chains on my neck, that's real 24k
Diamond shining like a star闪到眼睛落泪
和不同的女孩在不同的酒吧喝醉
Trash trash trash 我说的在坐各位
I'm fire like an AK-47 (Ayy)
我和我的兄弟做事风格就像野人
拿到属于我的东西还有人在等我约会
我喜欢把不可能的事情变成绝对
忘了 她忘了 她忘了 她退了房就忘了她叫啥 (Yeah)
只记得整晚在fuck她 打开了beat写了8个bar (Yeah)
Broken bitch, without me you are the nothing
You know it better than me definitely
I'm so popular 早已经legendary (Ay, ayy)

[Chorus: MaSiWei]
I'm drinkin' Evian when I wake up (I wake up)
Yay, broke-ass bitches, I can't feel ya
 (I can feel ya)
You can blow my whistle like I'm Flo Rida
 (Rida)
Pretty momma on my dick do her yoga (Who?, ayy, okay)

[Verse 3: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Purp smoke to the chest, choke that motherfucker, uh
Choker on me, they think I might choke a motherfucker
This me stating, underdogs ain't joking motherfucker, uh
Just to get sleepy, sippin' on syrup
Like rubbin' up under my covers, bitch
Bet I can fuck your mother
I'm sharp like a fucking cutter
She wet like the fucking gutters
And just like a nature lover
I'm wishing a nigga would've (Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy)
Before his bitch start to suck it
I stop and remind her to ask to pucker (Pucker bitch)
I-I-I am a motherfucker
And Craig is a chicken plucker
He told me your bitch's booty is hubba bu-bubba bubba
She told me that when you fuck her
She boo you just like the ruckus (Who)
I hate niggas, Uncle Ruckus
 (Who)
They goofy and bubble blowers
 (Who)
Ayy, bitch, this is my hypothesis, uh
Photosynthesis upon the pussy lips, uh (Ayy)
Curved like the beak on the face of pelican, uh
Hole in your body size hippopotamus, water
Ten toe rings, Prince of Persia pimp limp
Put a hole in a nigga just like a cartilage, uh
 (Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa, water)
They thought I didn't come from the bottom bitch, mm (Where?)
But they say I worked for this spot like a bottom bitch, bitch
