[Intro: Demi Lovato & YG]
Mmm, ooh, yeah
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Verse 1: Demi Lovato]
He felt just like you
His arms, his lips
His promises were just as smooth
His grip, it fit, though, I admit, that
Only you could make me feel the way you do
Though, you know love is blind
And he just caught my eye

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
You know me and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know, that I always needed saving

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Now I'm fucking lonely and you didn't want me
Trying to show me, that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no Goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
The month was June
The smoky sun, our fatal run
It ended too soon
With tears as proof, 'cause all the carpets stained with juice
Blood on my shoes and you know love is blind
I can see it in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
You know me and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know, that I always needed saving

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Now I'm fucking lonely, and you didn't want me
Trying to show me that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no Goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Bitch, can't even say I miss you back over the fuckin' text
Every time you slept over my pad, you over fuckin' slept
Toni Braxton told me breathe again, don't hold no fuckin' breath
Gave your ass directions to my heart and your ass busted left
Climbin' up the money tree, the tree without the lover's nest
'Cause lovebirds are some busy bees
You fuck around, get stung again
And you didn't leave your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
Look, baby, either love is blind or nothing's there
I can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea
And I was starting to believe, but it's a forest full of dreams
I smoke bars full of weed and call it what I see
And when you leave, I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves
I'm fucking lonely, yeah

[Final Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
