[Verse 1]
Stone cold, stone cold
You see me standing, but I'm dying on the floor
Stone cold, stone cold
Maybe if I don't cry, I won't feel anymore

[Chorus]
Stone cold, baby
God knows I try to feel happy for you
Know that I am, even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart, we'll make it through
If happy is her, I'm happy for you

[Verse 2]
Hmmm, stone cold, stone cold
You're dancing with her, while I'm staring at my phone
Stone cold, stone cold
I was your amber, but now she's your shade of gold

[Chorus]
Stone cold, baby
God knows I try to feel happy for you
Know that I am, even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart, we'll make it through
If happy is her, I'm happy for you

[Outro]
Don't wanna be stone cold, stone
I wish I could mend this, but here's my goodbye
Oh, I'm happy for you
Know that I am, even if I can't understand
If happy is her
If happy is her
I'm happy for you
