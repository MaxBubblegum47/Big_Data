[Intro: Kamille]
It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo, everybody
Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop

[Verse 1: Demi Lovato & Kamille]
I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you (it's solo, solo everybody)
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool (It's solo, solo everybody)

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Since you've been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby you're
The only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more
No more, no more

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

[Post-Chorus: (Demi Lovato) & Kamille]
It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
(I do it solo)
It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
(I do it solo)

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato & (Kamille)]
Every single night I lose it
I can't even hear the music
Without you
(it's solo, solo everybody)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Try to stop myself from calling
But I really wanna know if you're with
Someone new
(it's solo, solo, everybody)

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Since you've been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on (Can't turn me on)
'Cause baby, you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted (Oh)
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted (Oh)
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

[Post-Chorus: (Demi Lovato) & Kamille]
It's solo, solo everybody
It's  solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's  solo, solo everybody
(I do it solo)
It's  solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
(I do it solo)

[Bridge: Demi Lovato]
Can't do it solo

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own (Here on my own)
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted (Oh)
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted (Oh)
T-t-touch but I got nobody
So I do it solo

[Post-Chorus: (Demi Lovato) & Kamille]
It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
(I do it solo)
It's solo, solo everybody
It's solo, e-e-e-everybody
It's solo, solo everybody
(I do it solo)

[Outro: Demi Lovato]
So I do it solo
