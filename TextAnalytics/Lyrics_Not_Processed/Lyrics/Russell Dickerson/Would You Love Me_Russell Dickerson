[Intro]
I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out

[Verse 1]
Hey would you love me
If my car broke down and I didn't have anymore money
If I told 'em all the time but my jokes weren't really that funny
Hey, would you love me
And would you keep me
If I couldn't make all your dreams come true like a genie
Girl come to find out, yeah loving me really ain't easy
Hey, would you keep me?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out
Love you 'til my heart breaks down
Listen baby ain't no doubt that
I'ma love you, I'ma love you, I'ma love you
I'ma love you 'til we're old and grey
Love you 'til we're running out of days
Hear me baby when I say that
I'ma love you, I'ma love you, I'ma love you
Would you love me

[Verse 2]
If I didn't have a six pack and I was a really bad kisser
If I wasn't very good at taking all your pretty little pictures
Girl, would you love me
Because...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out
Love you 'til my heart breaks down
Listen baby ain't no doubt that
I'ma love you, I'ma love you, I'ma love you
I'ma love you 'til we're old and grey
Love you 'til we're running out of days
Hear me baby when I say that
I'ma love you, I'ma love you, I'ma love you
Would you love me?

[Bridge]
If I don't remember your face or remember your name
Tell me, oh tell me baby would you love me the same
'Cause...

[Chorus]
Yeah I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out
Love you 'til my heart breaks down
Listen baby ain't no doubt that
I'ma love you, I'ma love you, I'ma love you
I'ma love you 'til we're old and grey
Love you 'til we're running out of days
Hear me baby when I say that
I'ma love you, I'ma love you, I'ma love you
Would you love me?

[Outro]
I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out
I'ma love you 'til my heart breaks down
Listen baby ain't no doubt that
Tell me baby
I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out
I'ma love you 'til my heart breaks down
Listen baby ain't no doubt that
Tell me baby, tell me baby
Would you love me
I'ma love you 'til the sun burns out
I'ma love you 'til my heart breaks down
