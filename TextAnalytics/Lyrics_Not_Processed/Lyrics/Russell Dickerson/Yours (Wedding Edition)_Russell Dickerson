[Verse 1]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

[Chorus 1]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Verse 2]
I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

[Chorus 2]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours, oh

[Bridge]
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea

[Chorus 2]
I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Outro]
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours, oh
Thank God I'm yours
