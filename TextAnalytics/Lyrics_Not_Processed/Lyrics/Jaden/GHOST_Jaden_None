[Verse 1]
I just ran hunnid yard dash, you spent too much cash
Screw your Goyard bags, I knew that you wouldn't last
I'm in physics class, I knew that you wouldn't ask
She got too much shh What I'm finna do with all that
Talked to Elon last week, told him my whip too fast
Hunnid twenty on the dash, I hope that I never crash (No)
MSFTS on the map, drop hits that's that
Téo hit me with the pass, swish
Niggas wish I never rapped

[Chorus]
Play this shit in the club for me, for me, for me
'Cause if you in there, then I'll be the one that you never see

[Verse 2]
Like jeez, let me go put on my cleats
The way that I get up and run through the streets
Paris like bon appétit
They saw us and went to go call the police, yeah , damn
Just put a hydrogen whip on the lease, yeah
Tryna make sure that I leave a good world for my niece
Ayy, that's just me (That's just me)
We don't need you on the team, we pay too many fees
They told me travel light, we ain't going overseas
It's just one night I'ma bring the whole fleet with me (Let's go)

[Chorus]
Play this shit in the club for me, for me, for me (For me)
'Cause if you in there, then I'll be the one you never see

[Verse 3]
I'm ghost, iller than most (Iller than most)
I've been behind the scenes, I've been watching the ropes
She put her hand on my neck, she on the slopes, ice (Ice)
Why you put so much space in the flow?
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
When I wanna grow I listen to Hov, take notes
Look at the case, close it
Open the doors, look at my neck
Look at my wrist frozen
Look at my pants dripping
Swag, know that you stole it

[Outro]
Play this shit in the club for m— uh
If you in there, uh
Nigga, I'm ghost
