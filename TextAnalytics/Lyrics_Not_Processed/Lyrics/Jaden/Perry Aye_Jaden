[Intro: Jaden Smith]
Pyroman
Hey, wait, come again
Wait, hey, uh

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Me and Rocky sippin' sake up in Paris
Eating calamari
Me and Carti at a party with some shawties
Say what's up to Bari, ayy
Vandalizing your Ferrari, am I hating?
No, I roll with Cartier
Sippin' Dom Pérignon
Whole squad's on Perrier

[Verse 1: ASAP Rocky]
Out in Paris like I'm Perry Ellis
Parisian people love parasailing
Parallel park the 911
Parisian stones, fuck your VVSes
United Kingdom with the French connection
French kissin' and Parisian sexin'
French girls, French fries
French toast, French Goyard e'ry day

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Me and Rocky sippin' sake up in Paris
Eating calamari
Me and Carti at a party with some shawties
Say what's up to Bari, ayy
Vandalizing your Ferrari, am I hating?
No, I roll with Cartier
Sippin' Dom Perignon
Whole squad's on Perrier

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
Rocking that tee with a V
Fucking that bitch out the T and the V, ooh
Ducking the T-M the Z, ooh
Fashion week bitch overseas, ooh
Fucking my team for the week, ya
Fucking my team with no fee, ya
Fucking my team for the free, ya
Ayy, ayy, yeah

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
(Skrrt, woah, skrrt, woah)
Fuck bein' humble
Little bitch, I'm from the jungle, ayy (Word)
Haters talk down but every time they do
They always fucking mumble (Word, word)
Lil nigga, when you talkin' to a boss
Watch how you're talkin' (Word)
Cause I got some niggas that pull up right now
And put you in a coffin (Blrrt buck, bow!)
Yeah, put 'em in a coffin
I ain't playin' with these niggas, uh
Nasty back and I'm bossin' (Boss)

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Me and Rocky sippin' sake up in Paris
Eating calamari
Me and Carti at a party with some shawties
Say what's up to Bari, ayy
Vandalizing your Ferrari, am I hating?
No, I roll with Cartier
Sippin' Dom Pérignon
Whole squad's on Perrier
