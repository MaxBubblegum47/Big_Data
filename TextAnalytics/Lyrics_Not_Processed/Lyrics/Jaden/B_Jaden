[Chorus: Willow Smith & 
Pia Mia
]
Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
And from his rib an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand

[Verse 1: Willow Smith & 
Pia Mia
]
Why do I cry at night still?
Can't sleep without the NyQuil
Stressed out because we fight
Will we ever get this right?

[Chorus: Willow Smith, 
Pia Mia
 & 
Jaden
]
'Cause thy hair inspired God to make the breeze
Thy lips inspired God to make a man
 (
no more
)
And from his rib an angel born as Eve
Formed into flesh and promised him her hand
 (
so lay me
)

[Verse 2: Willow Smith, 
Pia Mia
 & 
Jaden
]
So lay me down in Eden under stars
And show me why it's us that he will choose
 (
take me home, take me home
)
If happy, I would die here in your arms
Don't cry because the ocean makes me blue
So blue, so blue

[Bridge: Willow Smith]
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue, so blue, oh
So blue, so blue
(Thy hair inspired God to make the breeze)

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
Well lately baby, I don't give a fuck
I'm sick of kissing up, I used to miss us taking pics and kissing
Now you miss the club, I pull my zipper up
Start to think "Wait, is this it for us?"—Nah
'Cause I fell for you
See I'm the living Icarus, relationships they suck
I'm lookin' around and girl what happened to me?
(What happened? What happened? What happened?)
They hate on me now but soon I'll be winning
And plaque after plaque, you will see it
And they mad at my accuracy
But my swaggy flow can't even rap to the beat
Better pass it to the chief, world is tragic and deceased
Cops selling crack in the street
But you look like the law
I know I broke your heart but I loved you from the start
Baby tell me all your secrets, baby you know this is hard
When I'm crying in your arms, staring at the stars, it's my—

[Outro: Jaden Smith]
I knew that there would come a day, when you would wanna
You-you would wanna, you-you would wanna run away
Take you to a sunny place
Girl, follow me into the ocean
