[Intro]
(Woo)
Woah (Woo)
Yo, woah

[Verse 1]
What you call an icon livin'?
Start a record label, MSFTS just did it (woo)
Nylon cover, five minutes, woah
We up too hot in the business (woo)
'Bout to make a movie independent (woo)
Need new trucks, Independent (woo)
I need you to listen to the vision (woo)
All your verses sound like dirty dishes (gross)
I'm about to clean 'em in the kitchen 
(woo)
And we making money by the minute 
(woo)
I'm about to do it way different (godly)

[Chorus]
I am just an icon living
I am just an icon living, 
living
I-I-Icon living (woo)
I am just an icon living, living
I am just an i-i-icon (woo)

[Verse 2]
I am not a Mayan, I'm a menace (menace)
It's wild, you can lie like a professor
I don't got the time to put you on the stretcher (stretcher)
I am here and I'm still flexing (flexing)
I am just an icon living
Start a record label, MSFTS just did it, woah
I'm Highsnob, cover five minutes, woah
We are so hot in the business (woo)
Last verse was before the award show (what?)
Icon tatted on my torso (huh?)
Me and Moi dipping in the Porsche, so what?
I ain't even take it on tour, so what?
Uh, damn—last girl signed the divorce, so what?
Now I'm focused and we 'bout to all blow up
We just tryna make the whole crowd go nuts (what?)
Look, we don't know no one like you (huh?)
Gold grills and you dance like Michael (what?)
No I's, MSFTS; no typos (woo)
Look, wait—we just wanna make you go psycho (go psycho)
Put a hundred thousand dollars in a Bible (woo)
I took the game with my eyes closed
Last verse was before the award show (what?)
Icon tatted on my torso (huh?)
Me and Moi dipping in a Porsche, so what?
I ain't even take it on tour, so what?
Your shit is fire, I'm more so, what?
Young Jaden dyin' on the floor, so what?
She broke my heart to the core, so what?
I guess we all gotta grow up
I am just an icon living
Start a record label, MSFTS just did it (woo)
Interview cover five minutes (woo)
We are too hot in the business (woo)
I'm going straight to the top with the crew
We should just chill and maybe take it slow
'Fore we get up there with nowhere to go
And we can chill and just look at the view (woo)
Damn, load a yellow rose into a rifle (ooh)
Me and Harry 'bout to go psycho (psycho!)
Put a hundred thousand in a bible (Bible!)
Damn, wait—gold teeth, dance like Michael (Michael!)
Man, this nigga on like a lightbulb (lightbulb!)
Owe it all to Cudi and to Tycho (damn)
'Bout to make a movie independent (woo)
Need new trucks, Independent (woo)
I need you to listen to the vision (woo)
All your verses sound like dirty dishes (gross)
I'm about to clean them in the kitchen (woo)
And we making money by the minute (woo)
I'm about to do it way different (godly)

[Chorus]
I am just an icon living
I am just an icon living, living
I-i-icon living (woo)
I am just an icon living, living
I am just an i-i-icon
I am just an icon living, living
I am just an i-i-icon
