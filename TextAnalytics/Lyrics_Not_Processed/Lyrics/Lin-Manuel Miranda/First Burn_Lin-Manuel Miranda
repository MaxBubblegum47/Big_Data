[Lexi Lawson]
I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I saw you
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

[Julia Harriman]
Do you know what Angelica said
When I told her what you'd done?
She said

[Julia Harriman & Shoba Narayan]
"You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun"

[Rachelle Ann Go]
Don't take another step in my direction
I can't be trusted around you
Don't think you can talk your way
Into my arms, into my arms

[Arianna Afsar & (Julia Harriman)]
I'm burning the letters you wrote me
You can stand over there if you want
I don't know who you are
I have so much to learn
I'm re-reading your letters
And watching them burn (burn)

[Rachelle Ann Go & (Lexi Lawson)]
I'm watching them burn (burn)

[Shoba Narayan]
You published the letters she wrote to you
You told the whole world
How you brought this girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives

[Julia Harriman]
Heaven forbid someone whisper

[Julia Harriman & Arianna Afsar]
"He's part of some scheme"

[Lexi Lawson]
Your enemy whispers

[All]
So you have to scream

[Arianna Afsar & Shoba Narayan]
I know about whispers

[Rachelle Ann Go]
I see how you look at my sister

[All]
Don't

[Shoba Narayan]
I'm not naive

[All]
I have seen women around you
Don't

[Arianna Asfar]
Think I don't see

[All]
How they fall for your charms
All your charms
I'm erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted
When you broke her heart
You have thrown it all away
Stand back, watch it burn
Just watch it all burn

[Julia Harriman]
And when the time comes

[Shoba Narayan]
Explain to the children

[Arianna Afsar]
The pain and embarrassment

[Lexi Lawson]
You put their mother through

[Rachelle Ann Go]
When will you learn

[All]
That they are your legacy?
We are your legacy
If you thought you were mine (mine, mine)
Don't
