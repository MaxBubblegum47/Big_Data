[Verse 1]
Hey, you there
Can we take it to the next level, baby, do you dare?
Don't be scared
'Cause if you can say the words, I don't know why I should care

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause here I am, I'm givin' all I can
But all you ever do is mess it up
Yeah, I'm right here, I'm tryin' to make it clear
That getting half of you just ain't enough

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna wait until you're done
Pretending you don't need anyone
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm not gonna try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)

[Verse 2]
Hey, get out
I've got nothin' left to give and you give me nothin' now
Read my mouth
If you ever want me back, then your walls need breakin' down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause here I am, I'm givin' all I can
But all you ever do is mess it up (All you ever do)
Yeah, I'm right here, I'm tryin' to make it clear
Getting half of you just ain't enough

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna wait until you're done
Pretending you don't need anyone
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm not gonna try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked)

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna give you everything
Wanna give you everything
Oh, I, I wanna give you everything
I wanna give you everything, oh

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna wait until you're gone
'Cause you pretend that you don't need anyone
Can't you see that I'm naked (Naked, naked)
Oh, see that I'm naked (Naked, naked)
I'm not gonna try 'til you decide
You're ready to swallow all your pride (Swallow your pride)
I'm standing here naked (I'm standing here naked, naked, naked)
I'm standing here naked (I'm standing, I'm standing here)

[Outro]
I'm standing
I'm standing here
