[Verse 1]
I wonder, maybe they'd never find me
I've been waitin' such a long, long, long time to feel it
Swallowed by the waters around me
Though I took so many wrong, wrong, wrong turns to see it, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
But I dance through the blisters at night
And I laughed 'til I cried and cried and
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (No more, no more)
And I sang 'til my lungs were burnin'
'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah
I'll sit 'til I can't hear your voice no more

[Chorus]
Suddenly the sun comes up
And I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah
Until the sun goes up
And I feel my love comin' up again
Suddenly the sun comes up
And the dark is gone
We made it to the dawn
And I don't miss you anymore
When the sun comes up
I can feel my love comin' back again

[Verse 2]
It wasn't easy tryin' to run with these handcuffs
I had to sleep through such a cold, cold, cold night to see it
Green flashes hit me right where I'm standing
Sunlight cut into your bones, bones, bones, started to heal it

[Pre-Chorus]
But I dance through the blisters at night
And I laughed 'til I cried and cried and
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (No more, no more)
And I sang 'til my lungs were burnin'
'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah
I'll sit 'til I can't hear your voice no more

[Chorus]
Suddenly the sun comes up
And I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah
Until the sun goes up
And I feel my love comin' up again
Suddenly the sun comes up
And the dark is gone
We made it to the dawn
And I don't miss you anymore
When the sun comes up
I can feel my love comin' back again

[Bridge]
Give a little light
To get a little love back
Give a little light
To get a little love back
Give a little light
To get a little love back
Won't you give it
Give a little love back
Give a little light
To get a little love back
Won't you give it
Turn your light on me
Give a little light
To get a little love back
Give a little, to get a little love
Give a little light
To get a little love back
To get a little love back

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I dance through the blisters at night
I laughed 'til I cried and cried and
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (No more, no more)
And I sang 'til my lungs were burnin'
I'm alive, alive
I can't hear your voice no more

[Chorus]
Suddenly the sun comes up
And I feel my love
Sun comes up again, my love
Until the sun comes up
And I feel my love comin' up again
I can feel my love, I can feel my love

[Outro]
Sun comes up
I can feel my love comin' back again
