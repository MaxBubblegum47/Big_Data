[Verse 1]
I don't see you
You're not in every window I look through
And I don't miss you
You're not in every single thing I do
I don't think we're meant to be
And you are not the missing piece
I won't hear it
Whenever anybody says your name
And I won't feel it
Even when I'm burstin' into flames
I don't regret the day I left
I don't believe that I was blessed
I'm probably lyin' to myself, again

[Chorus]
I'm alone in my head
Looking for love in a stranger's bed
But I don't think I'll find it
'Cause only you could fill this empty space
I wanna tell all my friends
But I don't think they would understand
It's somethin' I've decided
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Post-Chorus]
Space, space
This empty space
Space, space
This—
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Verse 2]
I've been drinking
I've been doin' things I shouldn't do
Overthinking
I don't know who I am without you
I'm a liar and a cheat
I let my ego swallow me
And that's why I might never see you again

[Chorus]
I'm alone in my head
Looking for love in a stranger's bed
But I don't think I'll find it
'Cause only you could fill this empty space
I wanna tell all my friends
But I don't think they would understand
It's somethin' I've decided
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Post-Chorus]
Space, space
This empty space
Space, space
This—
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Outro]
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space)
How could I make you love me? (Space)
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space)
How could I make you love me? (Space)
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How could I make you love me? (Space, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How could I make you love me?
