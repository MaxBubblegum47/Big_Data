[Verse 1]
I remember when you were all mine
Watched you changing in front of my eyes
What can I say
Now that I'm not the fire in the cold
Now that I'm not the hand that you hold
As you're walking away

[Chorus]
Will you call me to tell me you're alright
Cause I'll worry about you the whole night
Don't repeat my mistakes
I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside
If you're home I just hope that you're sober
Is it time to let go now you're older
Don't leave me this way
I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside

[Verse 2]
Everyone has to find their own way
And I'm sure things will work out okay
I wish that was the truth
All we know is the sun will rise
Thank your lucky stars that you're alive
It's a beautiful life

[Chorus]
Will you call me to tell me you're alright
Cause I'll worry about you the whole night
Don't repeat my mistakes
I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside
If you're home I just hope that you're sober
Is it time to let go now you're older
Don't leave me this way
I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside

[Bridge]
If you make the same mistakes
I will love you in either way
All I know is that I can't live without you
There is nothing I can say
That will change you in any way
Darling, I could never live without you
I can't live, I can't live

[Chorus]
Will you call me to tell me you're alright
Cause I'll worry about you the whole night
Don't make my mistakes
I won't sleep, I won't sleep
If you're home I just hope that you're sober
Is it time to let go now you're older
Don't leave me this way
I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside

[Outro]
Will you call me to tell me you're alright
Cause I worry about you
