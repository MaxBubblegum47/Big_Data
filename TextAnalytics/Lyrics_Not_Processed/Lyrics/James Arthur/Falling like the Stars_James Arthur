[Verse 1]
I swear to God, when I come home
I'm gonna hold you so close
I swear to God, when I come home, I'll never let go
Like a river, I flow to the ocean I know
You pull me close, guiding me home

[Chorus]
And I need you to know that we're
Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words
With you I'm safe, we're fallin' like the stars, we're fallin' in love

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, I can see
Four kids and no sleep
We'll have one on each knee, you and me, hmm
And when they've grown up
You're still the girl in the club
When I held your hair up, 'cause you had too much

[Chorus]
And I need you to know that we're
Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words
With you I'm safe, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love

[Verse 3]
I swear to God, every day
He won't take you away
'Cause without you, babe, I lose my way

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love)
Oh, I'm in love (Fallin' like the stars)

[Chorus]
And I need you to know that we're
Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words
With you I'm safe, we're fallin' like the stars, we're fallin' in love
