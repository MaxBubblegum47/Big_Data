[Verse 1]
She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face, on a pretty neck

[Chorus]
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think she said "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
(It's none of your, it's none of your)
"I'm having your baby (Hey, ah), it's none of your business" (Oh)
"I'm having your baby (Hey, hey), it's none of your, it's none of your" (Ow!)

[Verse 2]
It's New York, baby, always jacked up (Hey)
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up [Sniffing]
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus (Uh)
In a black dress, she's such an actress [Sniffing]

[Chorus]
Driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think she said "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, it's none of your)
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's none of your"

[Bridge]
She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it (cha-ching!)
It's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this

[Chorus]
It's none of your, it's none of your
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, none of your)
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, none of your)
