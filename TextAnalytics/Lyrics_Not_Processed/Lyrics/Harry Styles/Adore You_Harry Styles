[Verse 1: Harry Styles]
Walk in your rainbow paradise (Paradise)
Strawberry lipstick state of mind (State of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?

[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine

[Chorus: Harry Styles]
Honey (Ah-ah-ah)
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey (Ah-ah-ah)
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

[Verse 2: Harry Styles]
You're wonder under summer sky (Summer sky)
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?

[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]
You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna tell you somethin'
Lately, you've been on my mind

[Chorus: Harry Styles]
Honey (Ah-ah-ah)
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey (Ah-ah-ah)
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

[Bridge: Amy Allen]
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do
It's the only thing I'll ever do

[Chorus: Harry Styles & 
Amy Allen
]
I'd
 walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey (Ah-ah-ah)
I'd
 walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do (Ah-ah-ah)
(
It's the only thing I'll ever do, it's the only thing I'll ever do
)
I'd walk through fire for you (
It's the only thing I'll ever do
)
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey (Ah-ah-ah), oh, honey
(
It's the only thing I'll ever do, it's the only thing I'll ever do
)
I'd walk through fire for you (
It's the only thing I'll ever do
)
Just let me adore you (
It's the only thing I'll ever do

[Outro: Harry Styles]
Ooh, ooh
Oh, honey
Ooh, ooh
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
