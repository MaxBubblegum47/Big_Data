[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
What you looking at, do I got something in my eye?
Do I got shit up on my face, or did my hair catch on fire?
Cause you really really staring, am I something that you like?
Geez, ask for my number or you can fly a kite
See I'm 'bout to get with it, I'm getting ratchet and livid
You think I'm cool, then forget it
You feeling froggy then ribbit
Be like banana and slip it, before your melon I'll split it
I bet you know what you see, is oh my girl she deserve a
Beat down

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
Stop, wait
Think about it

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Work, work, run up, if you want some
Hear the drums how they beat here, that's how you done
Wait, I should think about it, never mind it's a waste
When the bitch hit the ground, how these Louboutins taste
I'm sorry, club promoter, let's put this in the past
It's just that bitch kept on staring, so I had to whoop that ass

Beat down, beat down, beat down
Beat down, beat down, beat down

[Hook: Iggy Azalea]
It's a party in your face, I'm about to dance on it
'Bout to dance on it, 'bout to dance on it
It's a party in your face, I'm about to dance on it
'Bout to dance on it, 'bout to dance on it
You win some, you lose some
But her, it's her day
You win some, you lose some
But her, it's her day
Beat down
It's a party in your face, I'm about to dance on it
'Bout to dance on it, 'bout to dance on it
It's a party in your face, I'm about to dance on it
'Bout to dance on it, 'bout to dance on it

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
Stop, wait
Think about it

Beat down, beat down, beat down
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Beat down, beat down, beat down

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Check it out ladies, don't take no lip
Take no lip, take take no lip
If you ride for your girls, then pump your fist
Pump your fist, pump pump your fist
Now swing it at the ho that you think looking funny
If she came with a man then take all his money
It's the year of the woman, go grab a can of these whoopings
And then as soon as she looking Aoki she gon' get it
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Ay yo cause she gonn get it
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Ay yo cause she gonn get it
Beat down, beat down, beat down
Beat down, beat down, beat down
