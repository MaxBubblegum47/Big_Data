Between the eyes of love I call your name
Behind the guarded walls I used to go
Upon a summer wind there's a certain melody
Takes me back to the place that I know
On the beach, yeah, yeah
Down on the beach
The secrets of the summer I will keep
The sands of time will blow a mystery
No-one but you and I
Underneath that moonlit sky
Take me back to the place that I know
On the beach, yeah, yeah
Down on the beach
Yeah, down on the beach
On the beach, yeah, yeah
Forever in my dreams my heart will be
Hanging on to this sweet memory
A day of strange desire
And a night that burned like fire
Take me back to the place that I know
On the beach, yeah, yeah
Down on the beach
Yeah, down on the beach
On the beach, yeah, yeah
On the beach
