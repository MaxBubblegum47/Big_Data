[Verse 1: Cole Swindell]
Dang, girl, look at you stoppin' me in my boots
What's a country boy to do but say uh huh
Smile beatin' my chest up, you're downright dangerous
That shake in your giddy up got my eyes going what what

[Chorus: Cole Swindell]
Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Oh, she's a flatliner

[Verse 2: Dierks Bentley]
Dang, girl, I'm done, I ain't never seen no one
Poppin' it like a cold one and drop it down like uh huh
Oh my, see the light, I don't mean the neon kind
One kiss from you tonight and send me on to the other side

[Chorus: Cole Swindell]
Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner

[Bridge: Cole Swindle & 
Dierks Bentley
]
Dang, girl, look at you stoppin' me in my boots
What's a country boy to do?
What would Dierks do?
Grab a guitar and go sing her a song
And go play one of my songs?
No, don't play one of yours, play one of mine, man!

[Chorus: Dierks Bentley & 
Cole Swindell
]
Yeah, sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor
She's a little heart stopper
I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner

[Outro: Cole Swindell & 
Dierks Bentley
]
She's a flatliner
Yeah, man, she's gonna hurt somebody
Dude, she's worth the whiskey, bro, go get her one
Yeah, she's a flatliner
