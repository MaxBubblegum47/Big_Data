[Verse 1]
Baby, it just took one look at you
For me to change my one drink order to two
Like we already knew each other
Like we've been talking all night
About a minute into our first dance
We got blindsided by your friends
All in a hurry like you had to go
Didn't they know you can't leave someone
Girl, you can't leave someone

[Chorus 1]
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?

[Verse 2]
We were gonna dance 'till they shut it down
People'd be staring while I spin you 'round
Thinking we were so in love, yeah
They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up
I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I don't know where you are
I'm under these lights right here in the dark

[Chorus 1]
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me in the middle of a memory? yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
Tore the back half out of a book
And no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me
It ain't right saying goodbye

[Chorus 2]
In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of what could've been our song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
But, girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
In the middle of a memory
In the middle of a memory
