[Intro: Florida Georgia Line & Jason Derulo]
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up
Light it up, light it up
Haha, it’s the Dirty South connection
Florida Georgia Line
Uh uh, it's Florida, uh uh it's Georgia
We light it up
Light it up, light it up

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at

[Hook: Florida Georgia Line & Jason Derulo]
This is how we roll
We hanging 'round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon
Baby, this is how we roll

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
I'm feeling a little dirty baby, listen
My accent’s got a little twang, little thing
Little something, something
Always makes the ladies scream my
My name louder, reverse cowgirl
Little bump, bump in that trunk
All up in my new Maybach
Let her wear my snapback
You can find us where the party at

[Hook: Florida Georgia Line & Jason Derulo]
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you
Baby, this is how we roll
This is how we roll baby

[Verse 3: Jason Derulo]
Yeah we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we love to get drunk

[Verse 4: Luke Bryan]
Yeah we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass is around and we dream about one day

[Hook: Florida Georgia Line, Luke Bryan, & Jason Derulo]
This is how we roll
Cause this is how we roll baby
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud, cuttin' through the countryside
Baby, this is how we roll

[Outro: Flordia Georgia Line, Jason Derulo, & Luke Bryan]
Yeah, This is how we roll
This is how we roll
This is how we roll
Yeah, This is how we roll
This is how we roll
This is how we do
We burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon
Baby this is how we roll
Yeah, this is how we roll
This is how we roll
