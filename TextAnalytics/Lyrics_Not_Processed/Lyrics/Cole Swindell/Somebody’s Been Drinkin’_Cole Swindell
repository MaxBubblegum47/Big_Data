[Verse 1]
First one came at 10:35-
Hey, what you doing?'
11:15- "Are you alright, did you finally get moved in?"
12:18- "I miss you"
12:36- "Wish I could kiss you one more time, lay on your shoulder" 1:09- "Can I come over?"

[Chorus]
Somebody's been drinkin' and got to thinkin' 'bout us
It's just the cherry bombs talkin' when you're hittin' me up
I got a fire in the backyard, half of bottle of Goose
And a spot on my shoulder so baby come on over
Somebody else has been drinkin' too

[Verse 2]
1:14 you say you closed your tab
But you need my new address
You shoot me a picture from the back of the cab
Damn, I've never seen that dress
1:26 screenshot, GPS, comin' in hot, two miles away
"I miss you so much," 1:28- "Why'd we ever break up?"

[Chorus]
Somebody's been drinkin' and got to thinkin' 'bout us
It's just the cherry bombs talkin' when you're hittin' me up
I got a fire in the backyard, half of bottle of Goose
And a spot on my shoulder so baby come on over
Somebody else has been drinkin' too, yeah

[Bridge]
If we cross that line tonight, girl it ain't nobody's fault
And in the mornin' light we can blame it on the alcohol

[Chorus]
Somebody's been drinkin' and got to thinkin' 'bout us
It's just the cherry bombs talkin' when you're hittin' me up
I got a fire in the backyard, half of bottle of Goose
And a spot on my shoulder so baby come on over
Somebody else has been drinkin' too

[Outro]
Somebody's been drinkin', yeah
