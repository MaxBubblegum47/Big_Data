[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, ma'am, don't hang up
Nah, I ain't selling nothing
I don't know what I was thinking when I called
I guess I wasn't
Yeah, I was just down on my luck
Having some trouble with this ol' truck
And the guy that used to pick up
He could fix anything

[Chorus]
Sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
You've got dad's old number

[Verse 2]
I learned it by heart when I was 6
He never did change it
I've called it in trouble
With good and bad news
And break-ups, yeah, you name it
Sure, I've got some friends I can call
They're always there if I need to talk
But good as they are, it ain't their fault
Sometimes I just need him

[Chorus]
And sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then, I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
You've got dad's old number

[Bridge]
So I apologize in advance
'Cause there's a damn good chance
When I meet that girl
Get that job
And I need to tell my best friend
You're probably gonna hear from me again

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then, I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
Yeah, you've got dad's old number

[Outro]
Dad's old number
