[Intro]
Uh-huh
It's LikyBo in this thing, man
C-L-O to the motherfuckin' Z
Tuned up

[Verse 1]
Hah, they still waiting for me to fall off?
Never workin' for a nigga, fuck a call off
And all you internet thugs need to log off
'Cause it ain't nothin' to up this Glock to a sawed off
Bitches sayin' that I'm a dog, you know these paws cost
Drawers off, she suckin' hard dick 'til it's all soft
Real niggas bounce back when it's all lost
Time is money, don't waste my time 'cause my line cost
I ain't worried what they sayin' if it ain't said to me (Uh-huh)
I bet shorty wouldn't be playin' if she was layin' with me (Okay)
Dude still don't understand that he can't stand with me (Nah)
And throw them hands with me, you lil' boys half the man as me (For real)
Life is what you make it, you better not make it hard
Tryna be somethin' you ain't, you ain't gon' make it far (You not)
Keep thuggin' out that window, I'ma paint the car
You nerd niggas Winslow, she lookin' for a star
They hear us bang the gang, now they wanna hang
Broski swervin' lane to lane, finna tip the Range (We all in it)
Ryan just hit another stain, Remy fucked your main
Mac just copped another thing, Quez ain't lost his aim
E high up in the sky smokin' with the planes
God, slam him on his head and bust a nigga brain
My brothers only all in, always stay the same
And we ain't turnin' down no fades, boy, just say a name

[Chorus]
All these bitches bound to fuck when a nigga up
All these niggas bound to duck when this chopper bust
All these bucks on my bus, this the money truck
All these bucks on my bus, this the money truck
If she ain't into big ballin', then she out of luck
Tryna call a nigga stolen, you gon' end up stuck
Mama told me it's gon' hurt when they betray your trust
So I don't fuck with new niggas, boy, it's only us

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm tired of bitches lyin' 'bout that choosin' fee
Lil' baby must be broke, you ain't foolin' me
She givin' throat until she choke or else she losin' me
Lil' pussy got some power like she Jubilee
Twenty-two with me, put twenty-two in him
My team stacked with all shooters like the Warriors be
These bitches screaming when they see 'em, get your daughter, please
This nigga thirsty for this thirty, taste this water, G
I gotta get it, I'm on a mission to reach the top
I'm regulating and paper chasing, just caught the guap
I'm syrup sippin', I pour a six in and watch it drop
I catch him slippin', I pop a stick in and watch it pop
They don't want you to win, they only want you to lose
You only do what you can, I always do what I do
And every time you touch one, it's only right I touch two
And if she ain't fuckin' me, it's only way she fuck you

[Chorus]
All these bitches bound to fuck when a nigga up
All these niggas bound to duck when this chopper bust
All these bucks on my bus, this the money truck
All these bucks on my bus, this the money truck
If she ain't into big ballin', then she out of luck
Tryna call a nigga stolen, you gon' end up stuck
Mama told me it's gon' hurt when they betray your trust
So I don't fuck with new niggas, boy, it's only us

[Outro]
It's okay, I know you niggas hear me
You niggas hate 'cause I know you niggas fear me
She wanna rape a nigga soon as she get near me
She in this bitch givin' neck, I'm in the Lex' and I can't steer 'em
It's okay, I know you niggas hear me, huh?
You niggas hate 'cause I know you niggas fear me, huh?
She wanna rape a nigga soon as she get near me
She in this bitch givin' neck, I'm in the Lex' and I can't steer 'em
