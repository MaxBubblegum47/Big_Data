[Intro]
I don't trust nobody, not even her
I don't trust nobody, not even her
Yeah
Uh
Look

[Verse 1]
My trust issues stopped me from loving like I used to
I fucked with you 'cause you ain't nothing like I'm used to
Bad vibes, lot of bad signs is what I'm used to
Sad cries, lot of last times is what I'm used to
So it's 'bout time to make a change
It's 'bout time I face my problems and stop runnin' from the pain
It's 'bout time I get revenge, they left me hangin' like a chain
I didn't break, I didn't bend, until the end, I stayed the same
But lately all these hoes been acting strange
I don't get it, how you tryna fuck with me, but fuck the gang?
My bitch say that I'm trippin', in my eyes, she see the flames
Crazy just an understatement, bae, I think I'm goin' insane

[Verse 2]
Not even her, and I think that's why it hurts
She probably want the best for me, but I could only think the worst
So every time I cheated on you, wonder if you cheated first
But two wrongs don't make a right, so how we finna make this work?
You know I'm down to do what it take
But I hate it when you lie in my face
That's why I can't trust nobody
'Cause they ain't really got my best of interest
Even when you said you did, I know you didn't, no, you never meant it
So let me stop you in your sentence
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, baby girl, I'm really different
You keep texting these niggas, I'm entertaining these bitches
You can't trust me, I don't trust you, but as long as we admit it
Hah, so is we finna let go?
'Cause I'm running out of strength to hold on
I'm here physically, but mentally gone
And I don't know if I'm wrong
But that's the reason I ain't been hitting your phone
Feel like I'm better alone
