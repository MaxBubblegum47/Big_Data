[Verse 1]
Look at how feathered his cocks are
See how seamless his frocks are
Look at his paper-beating over that rockstar
Look at how long she walks and how far
Was she lost? Or
Maybe she was not for
Traveling in the stock car anymore
Maybe she spent her formative years
Dealing with his contentious fears
And endless jeers at her endless tears
Or maybe she just got tired of watching him

[Verse 2]
Sniff white off a starlet's breast
Treating his wife like less than a guest
Getting his girl to clean up his mess
Never showing weakness unless it's a ward's season
It's the season of the ward
And she's trying to cut the cord
She's tired of planting her knees on the cold, hard floor of facts
Trying to act like the other girl acts

[Pre-Chorus]
And your strike may have been exact
But you know that you never really go to the mat
You tie everything all pretty in the second act
When you know that it didn't go exactly like that

[Chorus]
You arrive and drive by like a sauced up bat
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
You arrive and drive by like a sauced up bat
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
You arrive and drive by like a sauced up bat

[Post-Chorus]
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
Like you know you should know, but you don't know what you did
Like you know, you should know what happened when I came to bed
Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know what you did

[Bridge]
Well, good morning
Good morning
You raped me in the same bed your daughter was born in
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
(Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know)

[Outro]
You were so high
You were so high
You were so high
