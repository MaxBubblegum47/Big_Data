Sad nigga get you're ass off the street boy

Who is the worlds enemy?
That athlete or entertainer
Who rose from the concrete streets of the ghetto
Avoids the pit falls and trappings of society
And prevails to accomplish his dreams

The worlds enemy
That millionaire with no diploma
No degree
Who has more assets and money then most people would see in a life time

Who is the worlds enemy?
That convicted felon with two strikes
A menace to society
Transforms his life and overcomes
Thank god for hip hop
