[Bizzy]
This rap game terror
Money, murda mo, and all that good shit
Scandalous niggas, respect this (Bone Thugs)
Ask about my....20 inch deep dish rims
Son of a chicken, it ain't no friends
When it come to the end
And I'mma say word to gangstas
Real killas wit money to burn
Sayin' we a lost cause, foster kids-preach the world (Bone Thugs)
Thank god that I had a father
I'm pushed in that cocoa with my sister
When I was 14
Like cancer victims (Bone Thugs)
Uh huh
Cause haters they get quarantined
Women they comin' with sorcery
I'm livin' wit' curses, smokin' weed (Bone Thugs)
Burn me
Don't bury me
Hurry before my mama come see me
Somebody call Johnny Cochran
Some niggas they wanna be Biggie
Some niggas they wanna be 'Pac
But I just wanna be Bizzy
As soon as they hear me, they spit me
Like Richard Simmi
Don't run away, where's your nuts at
It's the original hydro smokers, somebody bust that
Trust that, what's packin' (Bone Thugs)
