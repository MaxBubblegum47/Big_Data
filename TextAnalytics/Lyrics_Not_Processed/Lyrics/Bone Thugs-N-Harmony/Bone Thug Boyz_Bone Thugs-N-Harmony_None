From the cradle to the grave I was brought up as a menace to society. A boy in the 'hood, I never let a nigga quiet me. Hopin' that the world don’t see the wrong side of me. But that's what they get when a nigga wanna try me. Slide me the work, let me hit the corner quick. That's how we get our money on them nigga's that I'm runnin' with. Start buyin' chops; borrow me a Glock. Set up shop and told the fiends, "Come get it! "

[Krayzie:]
And we don't give a fuck about the po-po, when they trippin' we get with 'em: Any opposition try'na block a nigga mission. Cuttin' up our victim, listen this ain't scripted. Ain't no lights and cameras when it's time to get to wig-split. Nigga's chitta-chatta, don't matta. Them bitches whisper. But, when they slip up drunk, we gon' get'cha. When ya see the sawed-off pump, it's the Mr. If I gotta pop my trunk, ya'll got issues

'Cause I'm a nigga with' a attitude, and I'll kill a mothafucka if I have to do it. So you can bet a nigga gon' get debted If I have to. Lay a nigga down, leave 'em stiff like a statue. Bone comin' at'cha, eternal rap: master. The piece of the puzzle that these lame's can't capture. We can slow it down, we can make it go faster. Always war, do any nigga wanna battle?

[Wish:]
Nigga uh-uh, let come on a rumble with' the Bone-Bone. We grown ass men but we got them toys-jump off. I don't play: uh-uh. I don't bluff: no-no. Sticky situtation, hesitation? Nigga, neva. You can be the man, care about your fam', we don't give a damn. Look at this thing inside my hand. Stay on ya square, leave the real alone. Yeah, 'cause a right wanna take you there

If a nigga wanna battle put the money on the wood, let's do it and quit the talkin', get to barkin'. What'cha got? You can come with' some garbage, or come with' hard shit, but really it don't matter I'm a kill it on the spot. Oh, a nigga fin' to drop. I could murda me a million MC's, it's 'cause I spit like I'm a uzi machine, and I'm a leave 'em all dead... Stop everybody grievin' and I'm leavin' the scene, yeahh!

[Wish (Krayzie):]
Ain't no competition for the Thugs-N-Harmony. Some of the greatest nigga's standin' right here next to me. It's like that, you can find that fact. We done came with' new slang and changed like that. Hey, put in on our shoulders; from rocks to boulders. Grammy award winnin' but we still thug soldiers. Get it off your chest. Roughness, nothin' less, yes. It ain't good to hold on to it. Flex.(Ooooh, you don't wanna...) Flex. (Ooooh, you don't wanna...) Flex
