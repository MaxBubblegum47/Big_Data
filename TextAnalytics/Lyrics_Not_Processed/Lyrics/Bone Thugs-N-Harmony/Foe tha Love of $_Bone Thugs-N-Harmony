Jewell

Gotta get on the grind, pop in the clip of my 9
And, bitch, if you slip, you hit the chalk
And fall in the night time, gotta get mine
Ain't takin' no shorts or no losses
Hop on the phone, call up my nigga, sittin' at home
Polishin' that MAC-10 chrome
Got a lick we can hit, so bring yo' shit
'Cause once again it's on
 (
For the love of money
)
To the dome with a fifth of Bourb'
My wig to the curb so we swerve and rolled out
To pick up the triple six thug
And follow the murder for robbin' the dope house (
For the love of money
)
Smoke up outta me bong
So high, now comin' to slay with four grenades
And a gauge, I'ma play
Watch all 'em fall in their grave and lay (
For the love of money
)
Pullin' in the driveway
Wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Bulldozed through the livin' room
Hopped out of the car and started to blow up (
For the love of money
)
Buck buck and a kaboom
And blew all them bodies all over the room
Them doomed, and gotta move fast
Why? The po-po's comin' (
For the love of money
)
Snatch up me yummy
So nigga, don't think it's funny
I'm comin' up quick in the nine-quad
'Cause Flesh be lovin' his money, his money (
For the love of money
)

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone & 
Jewell
]
I'm given up love to the hustlers, all them 
St. Clair thugstas
Makin' that money, stayin' on your feet
And you better believe, gotta have that cheese
For the green leaves, never catch me sleep (
For the love of money
)
Steady on the grind, get mine
Stayin' down for my crime, man I hit up the nine-nine
Givin' up that yayo
Makin' me sale, twenties, nickles, and dimes (
For the love of money
)
Beat up and stick up a lick up, that 2-11
Gotta get what's mine, then bailin'
Me kickin' up dust, I'm trailin'
Failin', 1-8-7 (
For the love of money
)
That's how it is
And I gots to have it in the nine-quad
Mission to check a mil'
And still be real, thuggin' on the Glock-Glock (
For the love of money
)
Creepin' on the come up, won't sleep 'til I'm done up
Gotta blaze me blunt up
Hunt up another plot and scheme
Gotta make some green cause soldiers nut up (
For the love of money
)
What up? Gotta get that business on
Even though the Buddha run me
Stun me, feelin' lovely
But I'm just in it for the love of the money (
For the love of money
)

[Verse 3: Eazy-E & 
Jewell

Standin' on the corner, straight slangin' rocks
Aw shit! Here comes the motherfuckin' cops (
For the love of money
)
So I dash, I ducks and I hides behind a tree
Makin' sure them motherfuckers don't see me (
For the love of money
)
Now my fat sack of rocks, hell yeah, I stuffed 'em
Police on my drawers, I had to pause
 (
For the love of money
)
And yeah, it's still motherfuck 'em
Now my game is tight, tight as fuck is my game (
For the love of money

Eazy-motherfuckin'-E or Eric Wright, it's all the same
Now niggas might trip on how I stacks my grip (

Thuggish ways, down for my crime every time
Follow me down the nine-nine
And you will find all of me kind (
For the love of money
)
Check out the Ripsta now, drop down
Run 'em up outta me hood
Rip straight when makin' me grip with-a me click
Rollin' with Ruthless

For the love of money

Me put 'em in mud, buck 'em, and pump blood
Got nothin' to lose, bitch

It's goin' down, steady pump
And peel rounds, gunnin' witha me gang
Bang, gotta make that money, man
It's still the same, steady runnin' thing wild (
For the love of money

And follow me now
While I take you up into a barrel of a gun
See, for the dub you're done
For the bud, I run, for the love of money (
For the love of money

[Verse 5: Krayzie Bone & 
Jewell

Gotta get down for my thang off in this thug game
So peep as me creep or me crawlin'
Off on the mission to back in the days
When niggas was bailin' with sawed-offs and wanted to get paid
(
For the love of money
) Runnin' to my side, little nigga
Ripsta, both on the mission for money
You give up the cash, oh, that was your ass
'Cause me and my nigga was hungry (
For the love of money
)
And, bitch, if you're stallin'
You might just catch one to the temple
And um, Bone raw doggin'
So nigga, just make this shit simple and run (
For the love of money
)
To catch one nigga
Me fill 'em with bullets and dump 'em in rivers
Remember, me killer now (
For the love of money
)
For money, me dig you six feet in a ditch
And get richer cause bitch, you were slippin'
I'll cut you and rip you, then buck you down (
For the love of money
)
Steady robbin' and stealin', makin' a killin'
Nigga drug dealin', needin' a million
Hustlin' drugs when the thugs be chillin'
For the money, these niggas be sinnin'
Off in the cut (
For the love of money
)
Where you find a nigga thuggin' off in braids and skullies
And when I stick you and lick you
Remember I get 'em up for the love of money (
For the love of money
)
