[Chorus: Layzie] + (Krayzie)
{*sirens blaring*}
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em! (Surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em! (Surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em! (Surprise)
Fuck the police! (You're motherfuckin right)

[Krayzie Bone]
Yo, fuck the police comin straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
But motherfucker mad cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beatin on, and then I'm thrown in jail
But we can go toe to toe in the middle of the cell
Fuckin with a nigga cause a nigga turned major
And got a little bit of money and they play us
Search a nigga car, lookin for a product
Thinkin every thug nigga sellin narcotics
They'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me blowin endo rollin in my Benz-o
I send the police to the grave
And when I'm finished, nigga bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
I'm still gettin swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grab on his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showin out for the white cop
But Krayzie Bone will swarm
On ANY motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from, the C-L-E
The punk motherfuckers be afraid of me!
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin around my way
Yo bitch, I got somethin to say

[Chorus] - 2X

[Krayzie + Layzie - together]
Fuck the police and Bone said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, and it's whenever I'm steppin
That a motherfuckin weapon is kept in
A stash box, for the so-called law
Wishin Bone was them niggas that they never saw
Lights start flashin behind me
But they scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
And plus it gives 'em a hint, not to step in my path
The police, I'm sayin, "Fuck you punk!"
Readin my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pullin out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so we can see what's up
And I'll go at it punk, and I'ma fuck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
And drop the gat, and Bone's gon' blast
I'm sneaky as fuck, when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
And any asshole, that threatens me
And I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin out a cop or two, they can't fuck with me!
The motherfuckin killer that's mad
With potential, to get bad as fuck
Now I'ma turn it around
Dig in the clip, yo, and this is the sound
{*BOOM, BOOM*} Yeah, somethin like that
But it all depends on the size of the strap
Takin out a police, 'll make my day
And a nigga like Bone don't give a fuck to say

[Chorus] - 2X

[Layzie Bone] + (Krayzie Bone)
I'm tired of these motherfuckin jackings
Sweatin my thug, while we be thuggin in the shack
And, shinin the lights in my face and for what?
Maybe it's because I'm kickin so much butt
I kick ass - nigga maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playin with the trigger
Of an Uzi, or, an AK
Cause the police always got somethin stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity alone with my group causes violence
Bone with the criminal behavior
Yeah I'm a Thuggsta nigga, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A nigga in a uniform waitin to get shot
By me, or one of my niggas
And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, I'm from the old school fool)
And as you all know, Layzie Bone came to rule
Whenever I'm rollin, keep on lookin in your mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And when I'm rollin off the 8, you'll be the one
That I take out, and then I get away
And while I'm drivin off laughin this is what I say
Believe dat

[Chorus]

[Krayzie]
You're motherfuckin right
