[Chorus - Layzie Bone:]
What you see is what you get, them bone boy's raw and we got chips
If ya'll act up we load them clips, put a target on that ass nigga we dont miss
What you see is what you get, them bone boy's raw nigga we got chips
If ya'll act up then we load them clips, wether rappin' or its guns nigga we do hits

[Krayzie Bone:]
Now ima show'em how them bone thug niggas soo unique with the flow
When its time to rock it they gon' know that we got uncut doe
When they get to poppin niggas try to battle
I let my magnum tag along cause if a bitch dont watch his tounge he gon' get rattled
There be ash's on the family mantle
Nigga can you really injust it, sendin' a nigga to even fuck with me
Im OG nigga cleveland's finest, but niggas started a troop cuz it was hard to find us
Told them niggas little behold we got the fed's behind us
And we been movin, dippin, tryin' to dodge their wires
Decided to stay quiet let some time expire, then come back like a riot and reflame the fire
"Hangin' out the passenger side of my reagl aimin' at ya mind with a nine when i reload
When the Glock is empty then i grab my desert eagle" and Bop Bop Bop

[Reapeat Chorus]
[Layzie Bone:]
"Hangin' out the passenger side of kray's regal
Standin' on the corner these thugs is my people
Blaze em' up shoot em' up nigga we dont give a fuck
Raise it up, do it man bone boy's, fuck what you say, Im rich bitch
Small thang to a giant, thats water under the bridge, little lay so death defiant
Im built to raw i dont respect the law, they got my brother alreay
They can lick on my ball's, all ya'll really ain't ready for what i be bringin' to the table
Got to get up get it willin' and able
Easy E in the mothafuckin house tonight, he gave me shoes, ima move, ima run my life
Nigga bark, ima bite
Dont do it wrong, do it right, watch a nigga take flight usin' all my might
Ima A to Z nigga, you can't play with me nigga
Whole team got figga's stack it up and count digit's nigga

[Repeat Chorus]
