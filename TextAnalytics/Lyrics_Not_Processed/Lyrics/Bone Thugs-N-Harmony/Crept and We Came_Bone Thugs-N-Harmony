[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Bailin' for safety we make it and chill
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Bailin' for safety we make it and chill

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Ready be offin and we coughin
And uhh, all of us pray
Follow me murderous gauge
Follow me murderous ways
Steadily pumpin' Mossberg peelers kill ya
Po po roll silent so
Pop pop outta the window we roll
Little Ripster realer stalkin
Better off this way
Tossed off in the coffin and bagged
Slang on the darkside man
Bang on the darkside man
Outta the thuggish ruggish city runnin with mail
When I bail back to my lair with a 12-gauge Mossberg pump and shells
Yell bloody murda murda comin' ta serve ya
Runnin' with gats and bats and poles
And if I hit the roses I withdraw

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Cause it's on and I crept and I came up
Remember that killa that nigga named Leatherface
Now if you a thug nigga pick up ya pump and buck it
But the bitch ain't done begun to fuck it
Nigga we Trus and we bout to be shuttin' this rap thang down
Neva takin' no shorts or losses man
No way no how poppin now
I step in the clique and I doubt if I change my daily thang
Nigga don't hang with the phony busta niggas
Only roll with thugstas, killas
Speakin of killas me sneak and me snuck
And me murda them every time now
Bodies be dug up in dumpsters execution double nine style
Hey, say give it up to the niggas
Who steadily slangin' that yayo, bankroll
When the po-po roll that's when you lay low
When the po-po roll that's when you lay low
When the po-po roll that's when you lay low

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Nigga shoulda seen the Bone done came and touched down
Came up with a plan now we creepin' up outta me hometown
Me hate to be leavin' the Glock Glock now
But I'm livin' so low down Bone gotta roll out
We livin' like Trus
Give it up to tha bang, always stay down for my thang
And I still remain the same
Never gon' change on my hood I claim
Nigga done jumped in the game
It's straight up confusing cause niggas be shady
Nigga still gotta watch his back daily
Even mo' lately, but they can't break little Layzie
So a nigga stay focused I gotta get paid
The buddah it run me forever me blaze
Thuggin' in my murderous ways
Prison or gauge let the buckshots spray
We Tru to this day
No Shorts and No Losses was meant nigga not played (Bottom line niggas)
And Cleveland in yo face
And nigga we rollin' wit Ruthless in the nine
For the pain for the gain
For the love of money fuck the fame
We peeped game we crept and we came

[Chorus]
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Bailin' for safety we make it and chill
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Bailin' for safety we make it and chill

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
Bone crept and we came wit a gang bang
Told you get down for them thangs man
But Bone still kick it with the same Trues
Thuggin' on the Glock Glock ain't shit change
Buck 'em fuck 'em put 'em in the ground way down, lay down
Busta, nigga don't be tryin' no dumb shit
Bone still be pumpin' them daily slugs at ya
Creepin' up outta the hood
Rolled to the West Coast wit this rap shit nigga made good
Thinkin' on the nine-nine reachin' for my nine
Reachin' for your shit wish you would
Pumpin' them slugs, put 'em in the body bag
Nigga down fo' yo cash nigga that's yo life
Nigga it's like that when my shit clap
One to the temple straight to the mind
Bailin' down the Claire gettin' much love, needing mo bud
Gotta sell me some dum dum smoke
Me meaning that yum yum dope
And it ain't shit to swang some thangs
Puttin' my gauge in your throat
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Bailin' for safety we make it and chill

[Verse 5: Flesh-N-Bone]
Ah nigga stay down for my thang bang
Sendin' me bullets up in the brains ah the bustas
Hustlas so nigga never trust us we the muthafuckin' thugstas
Strugglas 12-gauge pumpstas, takin' no shorts or no losses
Nigga the fifth dog, no tame swang (gotta get mark)
Insane, so many hoes done took ah loss
Nigga get tossed by the boss
And I'm off the hook when I put it down Bone
Wanna fuck wit a thug ya wrong
On the ground they lay when I spray that chrome
Bullets they fly, niggas they die
I'm coming up willing to ride got mine
East ninety nine off inna that crime
Where the thugstas find they time to grind
Droppin' a dime, packin' a nine, and ready to bang
Pullin' the trigga to blow out ya brain
Bone gotta gain man we crept and we came
We crept and we came
(We crept and we came)
(We crept and we came)

[Bridge: Krayzie Bone]
Bailin' for safety we make it and chill
Bailin' for safety we make it and chill
Bailin' for safety we make it and chill

[Chorus]
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Bailin' for safety we make it and chill
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
Bailin' for safety we make it and chill
