Chorus: (Layzie Bone Bizzy Bone & Tre)
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (It's the first of the month)
To get up, get up, get up, get up, get up (So cash your checks and come up)
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (It's the first of the month)
To get up, get up, get up, get up, get up (So cash your checks and come up)

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Hey
Today I think it's a wonderful day
And I won't front with it (Why?)
Cause it's the first of the month, and now
We smokin', chokin', rollin' blunts
And sippin' on 40 ounces
Thuggin', come, come, we got to in front row (Stay blunted)
And all nights, we ride
Hit up the block to where? (East 99)
I get with my partner to get me some yay, so
Double up, tell us
What you need, we got tweet to get P.O.D'ed, fiend for the green leaves
Give it up
For the first, it's sure, better lay low
Cause the popo creep when they roll slow
Break, if you can't get away
Better toss that yayo, keep your bankroll (Yeah)
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
And you better believe when it's time to grind
I'm down for mine, crime after crime
Fin' to creep, to the pad, cause mom's got a grub on the grill
If we got the four-oh
You know it's the first of the month, and my trues, we Thugs
For real

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
Wake up
And I see that my sister was already dressed
She said, "I'm a run and go get my stamps
Watch and make sure no one snatches my check"
And that's the mailman
Sort through the mail and put it up in-a me pocket (So I be)
Hittin' the 99 to get me a dub, for forty duckets
But ain't no bucket, ride that
Rita
Hop on the 10 to the click
Ready to get 'em up
With-a me thugs
And to cash that dub, man, I gotta get paid
Player, player
Holla, holla
St. Clair got much to offer
With-a me peeps on 93, or off on the Glock Glock for some dollars
So
Get a bag of yayo and a quarter roll
Oh
Most all of my thugstas got the same
And we gonna roll it all up to smoke
Better to change the hydro
We know all the cuts
To the up, to the po-po
Toss all that yayo, then roll with the chrome and say "Mo"
Runnin' through the alley, into the melee
Up on the second to sundown
Those run from
January, November, December, I'm lovin the first of the
Month

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
It's the first of the month
Gotta grind, gotta get mine
In the hood, that I claim, and I slang on that double nine (Nine)
Gotta find them dubs, gonna get a forty, can a thug, get love
What's up
Come and thug in my corner, baby, a donor
St. Clair thugs don't like that
And sellin' them dummies
Makin' that money come back
All of it
From the first to the 15th, thugs a-more plenty G
But I gotta save, gotta come up
Put it all in a cup
When I get blowed, in a pot or stove
Grab a double O's, time to roll to the pad
Count up my profits and add it to the stash
Gotta watch my back, see (Player haters)
Maybe out to rob me, fool
But never no shorts or no losses
Dumpin' keepin' this busters up off me, see
Gotta search the whole block
Spend a couple bills
Thug
Burn a lot of green on the first

Break: Layzie Bone (Bizzy Bone) {*Tre harmonizing in background*}
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (It's the first of the month)
To get up, get up, get up, get up, get up (So cash your checks and come up) {Ah, hah}
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (It's the first of the month) {No, ah, yeah}
To get up, get up, get up, get up, get up (So cash your checks and come up)

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone (Krayzie Bone)]
Wakin' up
Feelin' buzzed up
Early in the mornin'
Stretchin', I'm yawnin', lightweight bent
Chugga lugga, take a fifth to the dome
Instead, I kick it with my trues, but it is the first, so I'm getting me hustle on
Hop on the phone, callin' up Krayzie Bone
Wanna know
Did you O.G. check come? (She put me down)
I'm a hop on the bus with Biz' (You know, let's get drunk)
And I'm comin' with a pocket of funk
From hump, here to hump, T put me down
Oh God, how I love, when the first come around
Me be freakin' the Black 'N Mild
Runnin' through town, cuz, see, the first get celebrated
Rushin' to the block, cause I wanna get faded
Lookin' all wild cause I'm needin' me hair braided
We heavy off into this game
True to the first, just call me that pro slang
Them reckless from the east to the west coast
Makin' that money all across the world, mayne
St. Clair true
And I know I'm workin' late, tonight
But I gotta make a lick, so I ask the Lord to keep my homeboys high
We be comin' up with ends, all about makin' more on the first
Get a fifth, but don't flip
Gettin' live with the Bone Thugs, Poetic Hustla'z, and The Graveyard Shift
On the first

Hook: Tre {Krayzie Bone in background}
It's the first of the month
I wish I was there {Come down to St. Clair}
I wish I was there (It's the first of the month)
I wish I was there {Come down to St. Clair}
I wish I was there

Repeat Hook
