[Intro: Berner]
Yeah
Very thankful
Uh
Yeah
Big Berner, Bone
Big Berner, Bone, yeah

[Verse 1: Berner]
My chest keep hurtin', I feel like I'm dyin'
And it keep comin', I ain't even tried
Bread keep flyin', my girl keep cryin'
More plants dryin', accounts keep buyin'
Twenty phone calls when I hit the ground
Pretty light skinned bitch, told her spin around
They love big Bern' 'cause I been around
The closed all my banks, had to put it in the ground
Tryna tell me, "Slow down, don't go too big"
You ever take a step back and look what you did?
I changed the game three times, I ain't never look back
Fuck rap, I ain't gettin' a plaque
But the platinum cookie got your boy fat, yeah, I had to relax
Your favorite weed man pay me a tax
I'm out in L.A. chillin' for a week, pants covered in ash
Got your baby mama face in my lap (Hah)
All the weed got me dizzy
Money on my head, I hope every bullet miss me
Let 'em keep hatin', they be pump fakin'
Plus the thirty-eight got six like Drizzy
But the [?] life got your boy cozy as hell
No phones when we closin' the deal
I get paranoid every time I open the mail
Fuck jail, it cold in the cell (Burr)
And I'm ice cold, I live life like I'm ridin' with a blindfold
Yeah, I'm blind to the bullshit, rhyme with a full clip
I'ma keep it lit 'til my eyes close ('Til they pop off, yeah)
Big Bern' with the Bone Thugs
Yeah, I took my rap money, bought more drugs
Yeah, I took my trap money, bought more guns (Bought more guns)
We been ready, we ain't scared when the war comes

[Chorus: Berner]
I used try and count my money before my bag even came through (Even came through)
Then my dreams came true and all these old bills turned blue
(What'cha gon' do? What'cha gon' do?)
(What'cha gon' do? What'cha gon' do?)
(What'cha gon' do? What'cha gon' do?)
(What'cha gon' do?)
Uh, the money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)
Ooh, what should I do? All of this money, I'm blessin' my crew
'Cause the money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Yup, my struggle is alive and my hustle is the realest
Walkin' through the jungle with the lions and gorillas
King on the throne, ain't nobody gotta feel us
Fuck a king and a kong, man, the Bones is the realest
Y'all niggas ain't gotta tell me nothin'
Sum'n sum'n sum'n, why they pushin' my buttons?
Y'all real in the field all of a sudden
Nigga, Grand Flash talkin', end of discussion
You could call me a architect
Real lil' nigga, I'm too hard to check
Y'all lil' bitty niggas better have respect
'Cause the Bone Thugs playin' with half a deck, yup
First come God, then come the family
Finally understand why these haters can't stand me
Yup, y'all don't don't understand me? Plan B
We got the upper hand, G

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Rich nigga Bizzy, not fuckin' with any bitch nigga
Flippin' my chin up will make you switch, nigga
Take it to the bank, I make 'em break 'em like the [?]
Tell 'em as-salamu alaykum, no salam, make a mistake
Drip another body [?], we be shittin' on everybody
These niggas wanna see me in the potty
Long as I'm alive, hustle never to the side
Struggle like a mother fucker even when my money high
Gotta get the paper, me and my niggas
I think we got another 'bout the caper, fo' sho'
Money, money on the butt of my gun
My nigga fresh, I ain't dumb

[?] that my nigga would row
On the move from the fun, gotta go, gotta go
But I always been a thug, nigga, pass the toolie
Before a nigga leave, hit the weed then pass the dutchie
Yeah, nigga, bad and boujee (Bad and boujee)

[Chorus: Berner]
I used try and count my money before my bag even came through (Even came through)
Then my dreams came true and all these old bills turned blue
(What'cha gon' do? What'cha gon' do?)
(What'cha gon' do? What'cha gon' do?)
(What'cha gon' do? What'cha gon' do?)
(What'cha gon' do?)
Uh, the money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)
Ooh, what should I do? All of this money, I'm blessin' my crew
'Cause the money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)

[Verse 4: Krayzie Bone]
War smack dead in the middle of the struggle
Belly of the beast, niggas started from a mudhole, hustle
I'm in the tug of war with bein' poor and I'm tellin' the devil he won't win it
Would of never got it in if I wasn't intendin' on bein' the victor
My mind was always on the bigger picture
A swifter nigga than most, these other niggas, they don't even come close
You hear me? It's Kray Jack, nigga flow like a ghost, they fear me
Big deal nigga, sorta kinda major
But we come from the slum, yup, and everybody was such haters
Hopin' that we wouldn't get some but a nigga had the plans for the man
Had to work his hand out, y'all didn't understand
We all true legends, these are true blessings
It's very necessary niggas recognize

[Chorus: Berner]
I used try and count my money before my bag even came through (Even came through)
Then my dreams came true and all these old bills turned blue
(What'cha gon' do? What'cha gon' do?)
(What'cha gon' do? What'cha gon' do?)
(What'cha gon' do? What'cha gon' do?)
(What'cha gon' do?)
Uh, the money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)
Ooh, what should I do? All of this money, I'm blessin' my crew
'Cause the money never made me (The money never made me)
The money never made me (The money never made me)
