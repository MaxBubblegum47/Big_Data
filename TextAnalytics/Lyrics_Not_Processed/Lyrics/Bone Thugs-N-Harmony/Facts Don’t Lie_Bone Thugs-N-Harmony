[Chorus: Bone Thugs]
+Creepin on Ah Come Up+ from sunup to sundown
Movin we get up and get around - the facts don't lie (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Snoozin is for losers, that's somethin we can't allow
No matter what we holdin it down - the facts don't lie (uh-huh, uh-huh)
+Creepin on Ah Come Up+ from sunup to sundown
Movin we get up and get around - the facts don't lie (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Snoozin is for losers, that's somethin we can't allow
No matter what we holdin it down - the facts don't lie, don't lie

[Krayzie Bone]
AY! Run up on me nigga you better be ready wit yo' heat
If you wanna know if I'm really a G then get out yo' car and come see
Hit him like a batteram, knockin them busters flat on they back
I'll show 'em how bad I am, the baddest when it come to this rap
My nigga now Flesh is home, Bizzy Bone? He's still insane
And I'm still hangin with Lay, this nigga Wish Bone he ain't changed
DJ U-Neek supplied the beat, that nigga's still +Creepin Up on Ah Come Up+ (yeah)
They sayin the Thugstas fell off, they washed up and done, what?
If we claimed and we say the game is done
A hot rapper that ain't used Bone flow, name me one
I'll wait... nigga it is what it is
We made it do what it do, just remember this here, c'mon

[Layzie Bone]
This for my aces and my spades, all of my N.W.A.'s
All of my above-the-law niggas knowin the tricks of the trade, hey
It's like a payday nigga, Flesh gon' call it a Lay day nigga
I'ma call it a Kray day nigga, you Bizzy Wish-in this mayday nigga
I got a A.K. nigga like my name Lil' Jeremy
My +Hart+ like Stu's nigga, so these niggas scared of me
They don't compare to me, never gon' get ahead of me
Money the mission it better me, livin my life, heavenly
These streets is watchin me, studyin B-O-N-E
The hustle is really in me so money we makin plenty
'Bout the skills and the bills, still collectin for the thrill
So ill with the real I just tell the beat to chill

[Chorus]

[Flesh-N-Bone]
My niggas we at you on a do or die mission, it's about to get ugly for you
We threw the bait and they took it, now since they hooked
Flesh gon' gut 'em up somethin lovely and serve one hell of a platter
Worse than a natural disaster, they should've expected this chapter
But, there's no way to prepare plus the game ain't ready for it
Them original thugs got somethin'll shut all you bitch niggas up
Trust the facts don't lie, Stack about to take flight
No tellin how long that ass gon' nap when I cut off your fuckin light switch {*bzzt*}
... Shakin you niggas up with each medley
So heavy it's deadly, still the rawest to rip a melody
Fresh off the main line, from the pen and county
Right back to the block, no matter where we at we holdin it down G

[Wish Bone]
Some of you niggas got soldiers, how many you got that'll leave with a hole in 'em?
Wanna lay back, won't stress that, then pop a cold one
Huh? Like fuck it - ain't too many that can walk in my shoes
I never think lose, I do my part with a lot of heart (heart)
So I suggest you stay up out of my ozone (ozone)
And listen so it's clear, end up like with that top gone (top gone)
No prints here, I'll bust first cause death I do fear
And he might get one off, but gettin him back'll be my new career - retire on that ass!
We sick with the flow, but also quick with that grab and blast
You sensitive niggas get shattered like broken glass
So we just do my Thugstas like whoa
Silence is all you hear, and ain't nobody talkin you just gone
Play with me nigga!

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone] + (Krayzie Bone)
These are the signs of time, time, time (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
These are the signs of time, time, time (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
These are the signs of time, time, time (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
These are the signs of time, time, time...
