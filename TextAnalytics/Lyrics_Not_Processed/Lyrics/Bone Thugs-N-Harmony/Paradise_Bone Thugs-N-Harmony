[Chorus]
Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right we can sail away
And find tranquility

And we can keep sailing on, sailing on, sailing on
And we can keep sailing on, sailing on, sailing on
And we can keep sailing on, sailing on, sailing on
And we can keep sailing on, sailing on, sailing on

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind and I'm tryna get away
Creep off by myself and go hide, fly so high everyday
Tryna sail to the other side
And clear my mind and get P.O.D.'d every time
~*sailing*~
Life as a rapper, got me creeping faster from chasing after paper, I got to catch'm- make it last
And this world we living in all I need is my ith and a little bit'a hand to persuade myself

Insane, the brain mayne that's been joining the game, and that's the ticket all the way to the bank
I'm goin crazy, crazy, crazy...
But I don't want to be this way,(way, way, way, way)

[Chorus]

Sometimes I find that I talk to myself here
Drinking and smoking too much- shit ain't healthy
Been tryna fight it but I, I can't help it
Tryna get wealthy cuz it's really keeping me stressing

Can't trust nobody, kinda make it hard for me to love somebody
*Somebody's been sailing, and blowing away in the wind*
I think sometimes so I can level my head-
Gimme some time so I can level my head
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy...
But I don't want to be this way, (way, way, way, way)

[Chorus 2x]

*Sailing, blowing away in the wind (4x)*
Soon I will be free (fade till end)
