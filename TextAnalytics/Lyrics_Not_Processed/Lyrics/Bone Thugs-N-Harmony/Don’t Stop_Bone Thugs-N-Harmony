[Krayzie Bone]
Please, I'm just a man, survivin, doin what I can do when I can
I try to move in silence, like to keep it cool as a fan
I try to stay humble, chillin, real, down-to-earth's how I am
But then this business get to pullin me under (pullin me under)
Its makin me so crazy, should I leave it I wonder? (I wonder)
I probably should before it kills me, I know, but
My passions won't unleash and release me, I'm so stuck (I'm so stuck)
Forgive me lord, but now I'm tryna to get right for the cause
Don't wanna be standin on that other side of the wall, no, not at all
So please forgive us, because we know we in the last days
We's a witness, witness... so don't stop, don't stop (*ever lovin me...*)

[Wish Bone]
I know I ain't livin right, and gettin it right is part of my plan
But I been in the streets so long, I think a thug is all that I am
And I'm gonna get it together, cause anybody knows that I can
I can, yes I can, can... yes I can, I wanna grab my life before it's all gone...
When I look at it, ain't did too much, so much of it blown, gone...
Gotta do what's right with what I got now
But it ain't more than what's comin in right now
And now I'm left with choices (choices...)
You can do right (right), or you can do wrong (wrong)
Won't get so nice right now, but we can hold on
But until that day comes, just keep (*ever lovin me*)

[Hook - Krayzie Bone & Layzie Bone]
[Kray] Don't stop, don't stop the love
[Lay] It's just the thug in me...
[Kray] Don't stop, don't stop the love
[Lay] It's just the thug in me...
[Kray] Don't stop, don't stop the love
(*Don't stop ever love...*)

[Layzie Bone]
Now I've been high, so kind of obnoxious, miss you walkin around in my boxers
Miss you kickin it like soccer, other couples tryin to mock us, hold on...
Holdin hands was never in my plans, and then you came along
And made me your man, I must stand on my own two...
Can't understand what we goin through - this for me? Naw, this for you...
But you was the one I shoulda really kept it realler with
But I fucked up and this is real as a killer get
And when we split, I was like a lost puppy
Had to man up, and stand up, so the next one could love me...
But until then, you know I'm gon ride, with the Glock cocked, keep it copped
I hope it don't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop... (*ever lovin me*)

[Hook - Krayzie Bone & Layzie Bone]
[Kray] Don't stop, don't stop the love
[Lay] It's just the thug in me...
[Kray] Don't stop, don't stop the love
[Lay] It's just the thug in me...
[Kray] Don't stop, don't stop the love
(*Don't stop ever love...*)
