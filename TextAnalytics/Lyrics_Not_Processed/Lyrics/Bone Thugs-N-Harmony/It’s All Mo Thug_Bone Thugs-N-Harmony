[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
It's all Mo' Thug, it's all Mo', Mo' Thug
It's all Mo' Thug, it's all Mo', Mo' Thug

[Verse 1: Flesh-N-Bone]
Oh well, if ya snooze ya loose (ya loose)
Stop bringin' that pistol and fetch ya and shoot it
And catch ya shit popped
Stay tuckin' that gat in yo' lap away
So if ya can't roll strapped
Now how about that
That pistol go pop at niggas who
Go fuckin' wit' one of my own
No, no, wrong, Any place where my chrome
Left devils at they home
Double bang, execution, we mo' murda, stupid trick
You bitch that asked me
We don't play wit' me game that be remainin' mine and little man ran
To disaster, wish I asked him
And I popped up and capped him
And Eazy is where we began
But I blessed him in the master plan
Niggas thuggin' off in the Clair
Still depend
Can't fuck with these Cleveland Clair playas
So as long as ya betta be workin'
'Cause the Bone and Mo' Thug on this mission
Listen, betta pray everyday
Cross us on the way ho

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Ohhhh, oh, oh
I just wanna separate from the precious, baby
Or maybe
I was meant to live my life caught up in this world of games
In God's name I pray
The devil, he be bringin' me down
I can feel him cause he pullin' me now
I've been blessed wit' an incredible style
When there's pushin, it's just try to separate and to break this all down
Now ain't that foul?
So I ask the Lord to help me
"Lord, why does this life overwhelm me?"
When we livin' in hell
But we chill most every day like we in heaven
Oh well
But time will tell
Singin', "This is for the ringin' of the bell, the bell, the bell."
But it be hard to maintain and stay peaceful
If you don't know to tame the devil then the devil will beat you
Defeat you, deceive you, evil
He will never leave you alone
I've been lookin for a better day
But they don't ever seem to want to come my way (No)
Hey, I've had a hell of a time
Tryin' to make it cause my people steady stressin' my mind
So I stay high
So I'm already sittin' on the top, ya see me
When he be wit' me
He's daily innovatin' me
Rarely see ya on the daily mission
Keep your distance from the flames
Maybe you can survive, forever and a day

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Hell yeah
Got me flippin' in the North Coast
Remember me
The crook who wrote the book
I'm off da hook
Most of y'all niggas betta take another look
Cause if ya playa hate the Bone then yo' life'll get took
So quit, never bringin' ya no bullshit man
Face to face it's that assassin gang
Bringin' the heat, what y'all niggas bringin' is lame
But if ya wanna bring the pain, then ya gotta maintain
Comin' in on another level
I'ma put you on deck up at the top of the pile
Fake niggas wanna claim my style but I'ma break 'em on down
But you gotta come unique
It's the thuggish ruggish sound
That you're lookin for, or searchin for
Everybody boy wanna be like Bone and stay high
Little kids no longer wanna be like Mike
That's right they tryin' to be like Bone and keep thuggin' fo' life
Gettin ready for the end, dawg
Wit my nigga Ken Dawg, hustlas, Shiftas and Tre
II Tru, AJ
Same muthafuckas from around my way

[Bridge: Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone]
This is how we play
Every day it's the same old same
Around my way (around my way)
We be thuggin a-round my way
This is how we play
Every day it's the same old same
Around my way
Around my way
Around my way
Come around my way, my way (my way)

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
It's all Mo' Thug, it's all Mo', Mo' Thug
It's all Mo' Thug, it's all Mo', Mo' Thug

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
Little nigga wanna come, gonna feel my pain, hey
On the brain it's a stress, a strain
The game, the fame, the fame, the fame, (fame)
What about those hoes, oh no
Little Eazy fo sho to teach Bone
And if he's wrong, well, he's gone
For my journey to keep me strong
But dear Lord I miss my peoples
And it just seems so evil
And that I can't kiss my kids goodnight
Put 'em to bed, tuck 'em tight
And catch some sleep and that's all right, that's all right
I'll get mine, yeah I'll get mine
It'll take time, minimum crime
Weed and wine'll be just fine
Got somethin buggin' all of my peoples (what, what)
In the back of a Caddy
Jumpin' outta Caddies, spreadin' through alleys
In Cleveland and Cali like daddy and
Oh, no, love, for double-a and double-a zero
Really wanna get yo camo
Said I'm ridin' round in your boat

[Verse 5: Wish Bone]
You niggas can't fuck, with
These St. Clair players, on top of the pile
And we roll this
Stand back, haters gonna be here for a while
Can't ya hear the crowd screamin' real loud?
And that's for Bone Thugs
Dear Lord, my sis has got Bone to look up to
And feel proud of, on top of all of that there
Mommy's out the ghetto now
I thank the Lord and thee, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
For everything it brangs to me, yeah
I thank the Lord and thee, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
For everything it brangs to me
Better believe that we'll do 'em, do 'em
Shoot 'em, shoot 'em
Kill 'em, kill 'em
Nigga ain't gonna stop nothin, niggas
Been a long, hard way
Been a long, long, long, hard way
And I gotta get mine
Gonna floss up in the bed
Watchin' niggas watchin' me
That's tryin' to take mine
But I got somethin' for 'em, watchin' niggas
Runnin' away from me
It's time, bye, bye
Nigga don't wind up playa hatin'
We got much love in Mo' Thug
It's all about Mo' Thug

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
It's all Mo' Thug, it's all Mo', Mo' Thug
It's all Mo' Thug, it's all Mo', Mo' Thug
It's all Mo' Thug, it's all Mo', Mo' Thug
It's all Mo' Thug, it's all Mo', Mo' Thug
