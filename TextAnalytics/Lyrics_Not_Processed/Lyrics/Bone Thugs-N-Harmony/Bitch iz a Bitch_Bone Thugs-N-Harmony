[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Don't you hate that?
Your baby daddy rock
Look at him rollin', lookin' good, you ain't got shat
You might as well raise up his money, let's see his contract
Bitch, I ain't even got weed money [?]
Fuck you hoes, I ain't your trick, trick
I don't trust you hoes all in my mix, mix
Good luck old hoes, you broke bitch
You stuck with my infectious soul that I'm the shit, psyche!
I am the bestest dog, you know it, bitch
Belonging to your others it's a pity
I been fuck the titties, nigga
Man, I ain't lyin', know I'm fly, it ain't nothin' to me
But don't call me no god damn bitch, homie
I ain't no snitch, homie

Fuck the bitch, that's the moral to shit, come on!

These hookers steady talkin' all that shit
Big talk, big lips, they could wrap it around this big dick

Drop your drawers, let me smell your dick hair
Bitch, that's why you call me daddy
You know there's somethin' about me so you had to get at me
Go on, bitch, w-won't you make it nasty
D-do somethin' to my bone that I would never imagine
You think it's about yo ass? Naw, bitch, it's about this cash
Help out what'chu can, maybe we can make it fast, bitch
Bitch, don't make me go, 'oops,' and make you [?] this canvas like titties and it needs to be milked

[Outro: Cedric the Entertainer]
I was at the Church one time
Bein' a little girl, you know, she young, she ain't know what was goin' on
People in church shoutin', '[?] nigga! [?] nigga1'
She was lookin' around, she felt under pressure to do somethin'
She just, 'well, I'm gonna miss everybody and I'm gonna miss everybody
I miss my uncle Charlie'
Hey, did you just Bone Thugs at church?
