[Verse 1]
Who the fuck wanna bring the noise
Topple me and my boys
Disrespected on a record like a nigga got cloud
When its all about his mo thug music put my name in yo mouth and a nigga gon do ya
Who the fuck them niggas tryna play
They dont stop till you meet my Glock
Imma get you make your body rott
Nigga make the party pop nigga why not
Times ticking on the clock and the heat hot
Imma get him when the beat drop
Joy ride to the weed spot
Got them 22's spinning and a nigga keep grinning
Cause im riding through the city in a candy coated drop top shouts out
To the double Glock Glock
Cause you know the bone boyz got it on lock yup yup
Drop hits by the dozen, everyday buzzing
Niggas be loving how we thugging thugging

[verse 2]
Who them niggas coming through ina buick le sabre
Popping a sawed off robbing u and your neighbour
Who is it can save ya
Niggas in it major
Catch a nigga slipping throw the pistol bet he pay ya
Start em at the stop light wassup
Then i let the Glock light dump dump
A nigga better get outta the car drop the keys and cash
Fore i hit em the heart we raw?
So nigga dont be coming around trying to show out flossing get your wig split nigga
Be cautious on some real shit nigga
Be soft and nigga get killed with the hit lit often
So when you see us ride down in some other niggas shit lik
Oh boy its just the thug boyz, them cleveland thugs boys
