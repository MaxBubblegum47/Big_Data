[Chorus: Thin C]
Don't you be blinded
Don't believe everything that they're writin', it's only one-sided
You still wanna punish me when I paid my debt back to society?
Why they lie on me?

[Verse 1: Flesh-N-Bone]
First off, I'ma set the record straight so won't you lend me your eardrum
Nobody need to wonder where the hunger come from
It's full of thunder when it rumble, Stack don't fear none
Got 'em back on the track after so many years
When I was judged by twelve of my peers
That's bullshit they have your life in the hand of strangers
Now you can add up all the tattoo tears
Still doin' what I feel I gotta do, dawg, that's number one priority
I never been the ordinary
I put the extras on it, they call a nigga minority
They said I was a lost cause
Been in and out the system, doors revolved
I should of been thinkin', I shouldn't been drinkin' so much
'Cause problems alcohol never could solve
Drop my drawers, on top of the roof clownin'
Had to talk down on 'em, give a nigga hassle, harassin'
I'm livin' in my castle
The blast sound off, keep smashin', poundin' on 'em
In the mornin' arrested with a hell of a story to tell
Took half of a million, post bail
Fuck it, had to put it all up for sale
While society got us caught up in structural violence
So, when the table is turned, we fed up so we uprise
Set it off like an L.A. wildfire, burn, baby
Burn as the globe turns 'til it's over, ain't no slackin'
Smack me, I'ma smack you back
And it gets worse if we start pullin' out debt

[Chorus: Thin C]
Don't you be blinded
Don't believe everything that they're writin', it's only one-sided
You still wanna punish me when I paid my debt back to society?
Why they lie on me?

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Everybody wanna know how the greatest is underrated
There's never been another more imitated than Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh, truly amazin'
Here to stay and ain't nobody that can move me or sway me
Like a deadly disease, I'm really hella contagion
You better stay away or you'll catch the innovation
Less the limitation, stretched the litigation
Keepin' my situations heated with complication
I'm tryna tell 'em how to know I paid my dues
A lot of other rappers couldn't walk a day in my shoes
Stayed in my shoes to call them my street blues
I pity the fool that try to stop these trues
Now they see me comin', runnin' at 'em, doin' a hundred
I want it, I need every dollar bill, y'all
All the debt paid up
Even write the check to myself, pay us
Yes, I'm takin' it all

[Bridge: Thin C]
Got a call just the other day
Heard what the media had to say
They don't know about me
Nothing's gonna stop me from climbin'
And I know, they twist the things I do and say
And try to get my soul to break
I'll keep risin' to the top
Give it all I've got, I'm a fighter

[Chorus: Thin C]
Don't you be blinded
Don't believe everything that they're writin', it's only one-sided
You still wanna punish me when I paid my debt back to society?
Why they lie on me?

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
And let me break it down 'bout livin' Bizzy
Ain't nobody gonna play me, wake up swingin'
But my enemies can't get to me
Remember me, much slicker than a centipede
A deader me's a better me
You motherfuckers 'member when I talk about the murder, murder, murder
Don't be beggin' to me
'Cause ain't nobody gonna come to my street, I keep heat
Tell 'em nigga, bailin', nigga, all will be well
And I don't open the lock, no, nigga, not for the cops
I'm right here, nigga, sittin' on the porch
With my niggas gettin' scorched
While my niggas gettin' torched
We can toss in the stone, really give 'em a book
'Member the dream, triple beam
When I go back to court in the [?]
Nigga, this me with dinosaurs
By the way, let's tell 'em the truth
That nigga fuckin' with who?
That nigga fuckin' with you
Then let me tell you who you fuckin' with too
Now let me show how we do
See stack can't lose and the devil's bad news
Man, fuck these shoes and the county blues
Everybody wanna do it like Zeus
I came to get loose
I came to get raw
I came to get seen
With death or no truce
That's gon' be the truth
That's gon' be the rule
I'm in my body ready to die
Forever with you, I'm bailin' with you
You ready to kill, I'm ready to ride
I'll deal with my pride if my dreams come true
Platinum still, and that's for Will and that's for real
And that's the last kill
Last time niggas ever see me chillin' in the body
Give me my shotty, I gotta get both of his dues
Now let me slide to the other side with all of my troops
I keep rex with the boots, and my nigga recoups
Who will I write to? I done mentioned the pilin' [?]
That I got to pay my debt to society

[Chorus: Thin C]
Don't you be blinded
Don't believe everything that they're writin', it's only one-sided
You still wanna punish me when I paid my debt back to society?
Why they lie on me?
Don't you be blinded
Don't believe everything that they're writin', it's only one-sided
You still wanna punish me when I paid my debt back to society?
Why they lie on me?
