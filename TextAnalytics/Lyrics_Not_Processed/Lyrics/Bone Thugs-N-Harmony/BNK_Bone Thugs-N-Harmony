[Repeat 4X: whispered]
Killa, killa, killa, killa

[Eazy-E]
Black nigga killa
Hate brought death around the block
As the hollow points bust through the punk's back
Raising cain feel no pain as I penetrate
Nigga five deep as I strike at a quick pace
I got the evil of my dead nigga trapped in my mind
So my soul is a threat to all mankind
Born to kill, I'm wicked by nature
Cause the streets of my neighborhood breed young hellraisers
A 30-yard .6 with the scope
I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast
Motherfuckers catchin heat, as I bring anger
And release more danger, from my chamber
The evil in my blood is possessed
So I creep low from the back slow
And push lead through that nigga's flesh
Ain't no hope, when every nigga wants to be the nine-milla
On the trigger, the black nigga killa

[Krayzie Bone]
We be the mighty warrior
, black nigga killa
What's up? You ready to die?
You think you can fuck with them Thug niggas?
C'mon tell me the truth, nigga look in my eyes
Bitch we get live, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony nigga
Cleveland's thuggish ruggish niggas still down with the thug shit
Buck buck bust, let 'em know we still run this bitch
Just like an assassin, say nigga we nice but can get nasty
Get into war, what else can it be?
Nigga you know what we came here for
You know when we shot through the door
My niggas was serious, playin no jokes
Just cause I'm a rapper you thought it's for show?
Okay nigga let's see if this a real fo'-fo'
You thought we was studio, saw us on video
Seen us in person so here we go (here we go)
What is your problem? Here come the bullets
Better dodge 'em, I sneaks up we lodge 'em
Fuckin with killas, nigga don't make me kill ya
Got a bodybag for any you bitches thinkin you real thugs

[Wish Bone]
Say we some killers fo' sho' (sho')
Hit 'em up, hit 'em hard if you ready to roll
Niggas out tryin to fuck with us
But I'm givin you one warnin, that's a no-no
Cause I got what you need, if you are ready
To die, to die, to die, nigga bye-bye
Shots might be fired, yep, everybody gon' run
Naw, shootin at me, better hit me or one day
Fire! Here I come, come
And you don't wanna see we, like that (that)
Cause everybody pack guns, but Bone go pap pap (pap pap)
Really just out for the money y'all
Really won't hurt none of y'all
But playas went too far so I say fuck y'all
Fuck y'all, y'all, y'all haters
All y'all, y'all, y'all haters

[Hook 4X: whispered]
Black nigga, killa killa killa killa

[Flesh-N-Bone]
I'm servin these bitches daily
I'm a black nigga killa, that's what you can label me
Unfadable, see? You don't really wanna fuck with us
You can't touch us, you ain't able
Rest in peace, Flesh creep and sneak with a streetsweeper
Niggas don't ever know what hit 'em
I split 'em and snatch they soul like the Reaper
Have you ever seen a killer dressed in a trench coat
Sold over a hundred pounds?
Rollin, downin a fifth of Rose when I stroll
And who wanna fuck with me now?
Lay 'em all down, when I creep through your town
And clown I bet you feel ah
This nigga behind the trigger, clack back
Stack, that black nigga killa

[Layzie Bone]
Cause dyin be easy...
Nigga you know what Bone be sayin
Rollin with big guns, ain't no playin
Stayin down for the murda mo, slayin
Aw shit, just to let you know
Man that 187 for realer, we black nigga killas
And down to ride for E (E)
He'd a ride for me and that's the way it's gon' be
N.W.A. nigga B-O-N-E
All around the world, most dangerous groups, marchin like troops
Lace your boots, be ready to shoot
Cause if you ain't then a bullet might hit you
Picture yourself in a coffin
So stiff and cold, full of formaldehyde
Better scatter, dodge 'fore this bullet lodged in yo' ass
Simply for the cash
Been around the world, seen so many faces and so many places
Aced this game while they try to erase this
Daily basis, gimme my space, shit
Show me some love though
Just pump your fist in the air and holler "Mo!"
Could you do me that? And I'll hit you back
Little nigga just wanna know where my thugs at
Some at the track on the back
Oh yes, some niggas on corner 'round sellin that crack
Some of my thugs in the grave long gone
Lot of my niggas at home playin Bone
Could they rest in peace? My niggas sleep
Makaveli, Biggie Smalls and Eazy-E
T-Rock got shot, T-Rock got shot
Lord bless his city, bless his city
That's why I shoot, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
I shoot, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, always
Nigga, always - that's why I shoot 'em up
