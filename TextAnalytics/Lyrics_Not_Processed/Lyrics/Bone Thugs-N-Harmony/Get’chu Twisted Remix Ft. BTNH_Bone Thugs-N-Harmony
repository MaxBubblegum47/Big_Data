Let me getchu twisted man
(Gimme some Hen, gimme some gin)

[Krayzie]
You see me hittin the ground runnin'
A hundred miles and still gunnin'
I might be the coldest nigga that ever done it
I hit 'em with the flow that'll get me paid money
At the same time in the game though ya can't touch this
Smooth with the roughness, thuggish ruggish
I put a little bit of singing with it, and they love it rugged
Pull up on 'em in the bucket, bust it, lyrical killa to get dusted
I can tell how you bite my style, you been eatin' good
But I'm finna shut 'em all down
All y'all fall down, mista sawed off, raw dawg, I'm tellin' y'all now
Y'all better get ready for Ball'R Records and ThugLine
Caught up in the rapture, we got ya just after one rhyme
They don't really wanna get it on
They don't wanna see the Bone Bone
We can take it to the middle of the floor yo, harass them niggas
Get up in 'em like the po-po, still flow so cold
Krayzie's tecs are blazin' at ya, aimed exactly atcha, gotcha
Shots will drop ya, fade ya proper, rock the spot and make ya holla
"Dolla bill y'all" make a mill with my real dawgs
Wet it down niggas I don't feel y'all
Gotta kick it with the trill, always gotta chill with a ill squad
That'll really feel y'all, y'all, y'all
Bone still doin' it to 'em
No matter who in the room or who in the build'
No matter who close the show
You ask the party people who stole the dough, they know

(Hook)

[Bizzy]
Rock the mic' giving the people what they like
I've be struggling, hustling trying to make it right most all of my life
And when I can pull up next to 5-0, it's just like gambling dice
7-11 y'all better be ready this Bizzy The Kid I'ma be here all night
No matter what I'ma still support you
Whenever you ready let's rock the world
Better believe I'ma fight for the money
Yes I'm ready to die...yes sir!
You don't want me to make good on my word
You better be worried about my nerve
I say that we distribute the product and move it like Nino in here
I push the bird
Comin' up fast I pump I dump out
Never been no chump, I crunk out
You don't really want none, let's smash 'em that's how I run mine
I'm running fast past that gun line, busting at bud for one time
Yeah gotta keep it gangster feelin' my life is in danger
Sometimes blaze the flame up make your paper
We Bone Thug 'til we die
Better support it and if you don't when I see you just pass me by
Hell of a ride, hard play, and I'm trying to be calm, paid
And I'm trying to stay on point for when Satan come up out my way, hey

(Hook)

[Wish]
Now into the land of thugs doing flowing and singing
No matter what we breathe it's raw with no flaws
Been ahead of y'all
Who the niggas done changed the game?
Who the niggas got screamin' out "Thugsta thugsta" mic
Yes we murda flow, don't wanna but let it go
Believe me I'm serious dawg
You straight from the hood? Good! Im thug, we in every hood
They don't really want none, they don't want none
Just to get to crackin' get to poppin' they gon' run
I'm up early to get my hustle on, later to get it strong and I'm gone
Gotta touch another mill for real cause I'm feeling like anyday
I might just kill something
Cause you know that money
Once you touch it, once you feel it gotta keep you some money
Roll with niggas that's thirsty
Pull the getaway? Then maybe ya lucky
We can do it like the thuggish ruggish would
Ain't no bitches over here better show some love
Most niggas that screamin straight be hoes
But it's real over here beat him like it's cold
Well you see I'm hot yes I'm holding
Even when I'm rocking and rolling
Won't get onto me when it all goes down
Be the first nigga cocking and gunning
Nine mill will reach ya, they all fall down straight shots will get ya
Had too much of that liter
Now ya all fucked up how ya niggas like that fact?

(Hook)

[Layzie]
So you want to get twisted, lifted?
I'ma show you who's the realest in the city of the thieves
We them real cap peelas
Better get back niggas, we do slap niggas
When it comes to figures, I'm a go getter
Hit around split 'em when I'm pushin' my line
Money hangin' out the ass didn't get it for crime
Ain't worrying about beef but I carry a nine
I'ma put it on your mind when you're flippin my minds
Yeah yeah, St. Clair playa
With the keys to the city you can call me the mayor
Give a damn around pity life just ain't fair
Do I care about you lames? Y'all better beware
Ain't went nowhere, still right here
Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish and Flesh
Money on the wood make the day go good
Drop it like it's hot we'll see who's the best yes
I must confess I'm a cold blooded nigga man
Show me if you've got some game
I'ma show you how to get some change
Still the fact remains we lets'em hang: Bone will murder your clique
Hit 'em again and again off a bottle of Hen
Off the rip we murder them quick
Twist 'em up like a pretzel
With the automatic weapons we let it go
From ghetto to ghetto you better get on my level
I'm a Bone Thug rebel and I'm lookin for trouble
Twisted up like a good double, double
Twisted up like some fine weed
Got beef in the streets you can hire me
Twisted like screws and pliers be
