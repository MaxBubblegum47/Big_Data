[Intro: Layzie Bone]
East 1999 my niggas

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
Thinkin' 'bout back in the days when the year was '89
Little nigga on the grind, gotta get mine doing my crime
With Toot and Hen, steady stacking my ends
Putting my serve down on the Clair 9-9
Hitting up the Graveyard Shift with Ren
Little Will, Big Wally and Wish Bone
Little Wally High Rollerz and he wonder why niggas so strong
Krayzie Bone,

Kept a nigga on his toes in the game
It's an everyday thang when you let ya nuts hang
Gotta make a grand at least daily, man
Them Cleveland hustlers never no busters, thug to the heart
We niggas from the land fool, and the old school
Just serve out ya sentence and be cool
Fucking with Trues, 
rest in peace
Little nigga RIPsta

Smoking on bud, 'cause a nigga Mo Thug
Calling up my niggas when it's time to nut up
In the 9-9, niggas gonna drop to the number one
With your gun so run, run
Cleveland is the city where a nigga come from
Slanging them dum-dum-dum dums

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Niggas it's going down up in the C-Town
Get 'em up with a thug and the nigga with the bud
Got the fifth of Rose
'Fore the liquor store close, hit 'em up with the forty reasons
Nigga, roll up ya Buddha
Smoke it all up, nigga, don't stiff on the reefer
Mo running up outta the club with this
Plus I got hydro and this shit is creeper, peep the
Strip as you hear the double Glock-Glock
Widda me rocks cocked, sweating me bad
Coppers betta drop when the gunshots pop
Glock top hit the body and the bullshit stop
Whenever them troubling us
Where the po-po niggas roll solo, split up and swerve
Krayzie take caution, take out my yayo and tossed it
Send 'em in the road to the curb
Running, ducking
Jumping up in the land, my niggas is crazy
We slang and we buck and we bang on the Glock
And my nigga that’s daily
Who the nigga with the 12-gauge, pump
Mr. Sawed-Off Leatherface so you betta pray
Eternally thugsta, 
East 1999
That 9 we rep to the death, what!

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Gotta give peace to the SCTs
And the one big thug on the Glock
Pump blast to the cash
Then I mash the gas gotta dash away from the cops
Now 
Li'l Mo Heart
 steadily sippin' on Rose
Ripping up flesh with six fours
That's that thugsta, yes I pump slugs
And I be dropping 'em off in dumpsters
Fuck them po-po, all a dem bodies we burn, burn
And I guess that hood'll never learn
Gotta dip mo' thin ones in sherm
When I'm on a mission for my city
Pick up my niggas be peeling out with me
Me roll up the window, the wind blow
Fuck up my indo high that’s hitting me
Even if the barrels of me 12 gauge are empty, me scandalous
Niggas up outta the woods bucking, no fucking with the family
Now feel it nigga, understand me
Much love, much bud for them St. Clair Thugs
East 1999 is where you'll find me
Slanging me motherfucking drugs

[Verse 4: Flesh-N-Bone]
Dun dun, leaving the niggas to cock it, pop widda me gun
They know that me nodding they head off and I gots to have me fun
Leaving 'em hung, breaking, faking, 
you studio gangsta bitch
, trick
Niggas'll get beat, I'm handling the shit and I split in the midst of the darkness
Consider me heartless, oh yes Flesh be running a ho check
Betta check your Rolex, ya timed now for giving up respect
To them SCTs from C-L-E plus scandalous niggas that dwell
Hell off of the forscythe and bail, leaving a trail of
The bloody victims, 
the Fifth Dog mauling 'em all
And never them catch me slipping
And sipping the fifth of divine
They may give me time instead a me tripping
We flipping the scripts on over, 
see the Bone a be never sober
Niggas told you, triggers showed you, East 9-9, five soldiers

[Verse 5: Wish Bone]
Wanna run, red rum, try to run and get away
But it's just too late
Watch out buckshots when I come, buck buck
Betta guard that fucking face
Dumping them slugs on you fools
Rolling with me Trues, drinking brews
Don't start no shit
We come equipped so niggas stay cool

Put slugs all up in that chest and
Now Hell is where you be dwelling
Popping a clip in them bodies me dumping
Watching you fall to the pave
Wid me nine milli pumping
Putting them bodies all off in them graves
