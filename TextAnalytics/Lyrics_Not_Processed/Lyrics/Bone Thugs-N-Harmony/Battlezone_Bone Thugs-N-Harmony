Bizzy (Krayzie)
Pick up you'r wings and prepare them to fly
(Bone thug souljah bone thug souljah,souljah)
In the battlezone,the battlezone
(Bone thug souljah,souljah,bone thug)
Swing low (swing low)
Sweet chariot (sweet chariot)
Coming forth to carry me home (coming forth to carry me home)
Swing low sweet chariot (sweet chorit)
Coming forth to carry me home (coming forth to carry me home)
I looked up on jordan and (what did )what did I see (what did I see)
Coming forth to carry me home (coming forth to carry me home)
(What did I see,what did I see)
Coming forth to carry me home (coming forth to carry me home)
(Listen to my battle cry
Come on,come on in my battlezone (aaah my battle cry)
Get up,get up,get up,get up,come in my battlezone
(Listen to my battle cry)
Get up,get up,get up,get up,come on
Have me come for (aaah my battle cry)
Get up,get up,get up,get up,come on (come on)

(Bizzy)
One,two look at the tally they drew my picture with Bob Marley
They probably wanna kill me will I die in 1999 smoking phillies
Bizzy the kid was bustin in the ceilin in my big claim
Kickin on somethig and dig this
Got to feel it catch and don't let go
Wretched in a fro
Bone watchin for the po,po
Roll over then pull it got my bullet in my fo,fo
I gotta stand it's turnin to a jungle (green bay)
Comin out a 4-door benz and I spend a lot for show
No no don't spend a lot contend with a men
Lookin at my watch lke a meal ticket
Arrest the block they couldn't pin it better send it
For the cops absorb you soul of course
Praise to the pharoah
Murder mo,curly I heard it lower and return it burn
When our niggas still shermed out
Court's adjourned!,court's adjouned!
Rest and burn!

(Layzie)
I can't sleep at night cause I lay in my bed
And I be tossin and turnin trying to avoid my dreams
And I can hear the niggas lettin off they lead around the corner
Got me feelin paranoia like they coming for me
And I be clutchin' my heat, got me pacing back and forth
So much shit on my mind, so many things to do
So little time a nigga really got to do it in
Man I be ready for war in my fatigues and boots
From the minute nigga step outside
Nina Ross on my hip and I got to pack one
Just like Little Eazy-E told you and me
Nigga never leave the house without packin a gun
And that's real leave it for the dollar bill
Niggas'll holler “Kill Kill” then start flexin
When the shit poppin' off in my direction
Nigga got a 17-shot for protection
Life ain't no joke
Too many niggas I know was takin' shit for granted and that's foul
Nigga if you see a fool, pick a fool right out the crowd
And hit him dead in his mouth for being loud and wild
Shit is real
Ain't none of that elastic faggot rubber band plastic shit
Muthafuckas in the battle zone blastin shit
Put the match on shit straight up gassin shit

(Krayzie)
Hell yeah! It's that same nigga runnin' with the AK-47
Bustin niggas in the belly
Give them muthafuckas more than just a headache
Get back at that nigga faster than FedEx
They're runnin retreatin screamin Mayday we're goin down
Now why the fuck is niggas tellin lies and rumors?
Talkin about we split up
Cause I see Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh
Niggas really need to shut that shit up
If a muthafucka really want to rumble we can tumble
We wilder than any animal that's in the jungle
The name of the game is block the basket, strike him out
Hit the goal make the quarterback fumble strategize
Any nigga hatin' ain't a friend of mine
Nigga considered the enemy niggas that's when you die
I never keep my enemies close
Cause I got a perfect view of 'em in my scope
That's close enough
Leather Face'll fuck a nigga up and smile
And hit 'em with the millimeter
And I show a bitch kill a nigga see me drivin
Bitch come on and try to rob me
I'm willing to bet that 'cha get lit up
Get off of me baby (baby)
Keep on comin' and there's gon' be drama (drama)
Tellin you niggas you better not fuck with me
Cause I ain't that quiet nigga that I used to be
Look how the haters give a nigga attitude
Nigga sick of being humble now I'm like fuck that I gotta get mine
They try to show a nigga love, but fuck that it ain't no love
Cause in the game you get fucked every time
Got this feeling inside my bloodline
Somebody finna get fucked up! If a nigga don't get some satisfaction
Blastin' like a madman
Gettin' with the static nigga lovin the action
Yeah My Bone Thug niggas come on
If any one of you niggas got any problems
Thinkin' you tough and you really want to solve 'em
Don't be mumblin speak a little louder
While you steady talkin' like you liver than the next nigga
We'll already be up in you now hater feel us
Who the realest The Bone Thug killas
If there's any objections niggas deal with 'em
Realer than them other muthafuckas talkin' about they thugs
Jumpin all on the bandwagon
Wanna be like us, wanna cuss, wanna bust they guns
Thugged out with they pants saggin they actin'
But when it's really time to show some tactics
The niggas don't have 'em
We murdered the bastards, puttin em all in bodybags and caskets
Drop 'em in the river, splash that's that ass
Cause when we clash ain't no comin back
Huntin' niggas from the past
We gon' settle this shit right here
Fight to whoever blood be spilled first
Who will be the nigga ridin' away in a Hearse?
Not me I'm determined to wake up and still be livin' in the morning you
Feeling me
Quicker than a clocked damn missle
Hit a bitch directly in the middle, right between your eye
Then we makin' sure that nigga die
Shoot a couple more times and ride out (ride out, ride out)
Nigga we ride out. (ride out, ride out)
Nigga we ride out. (ride out, ride out)
Nigga we ride out
