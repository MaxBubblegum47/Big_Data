Yeah, Real Talk Entertainment
Bizzy the kid, young glory fiend
Star rocker, you know what it is baby
(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
Layzie Layzie whoa
Crystal comin up outta that door
Foe, ready for war
Ready to buck that, smoke 'em like 'dro
Whoa, Crystal comin up outta that door
Foe, ready for war
Ready to buck that, smoke 'em like 'dro
Layzie Layzie whoa

(Verse 1, Bizzy Bone)
Back in the days, hey
What more can I say, you waked
In the thang with a double-barrel sawed-off shotgun
'Fore ya know it, I'mma bust that thang
Smells so good, it overwhelms that stank
How could I hate you, when I say thanks?
I pull away, I roll like tape
Solely approaching, destroy them snakes
Thoughts in the sand and the grain of the mind
Like the ring that's around that Saturn line
Still in my prime, never gon' leave
Not without Eve and a baby on my sleeve
Boom-boom, leave
Put it on Steve
Holla at g's, please be cordial
Enjoy yo drank, enjoy yo food
Say what you more-so, murder that torso
I put a quarter on my brothers and flowers and trees
Enemies good, baby boy breathe
Think to save ya
For the light, yes I believe
Before I leave, take this money in peace
Abraham style, watch that beast
Judas is forgiven, re-livin, now keep it in preach
In this world, you must have you some breast, balls
And have you a couple of brawls, yeah
You know what we gon' do
Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day
Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day-day

(Verse 2, Layzie Bone)
I'm the go-to boy for the realistic hip-hop
Motherfuckas know little Lay don't flip-flop
That's why I came back to the tip-top
Everybody else, these niggas gon' drip-drop
Get popped, shit stop, grandpa gets his tick-tocked
Grandfather clock, and y'all just a wrist-watch
Layzie Bone gon'...
Murda, mo' murda, mo murda, mo murda, mo murda, for his spot
Like Eightball & MJG, I'mma lic shots, lic shots
Screamin out "fuck tha police", better tell 'em come get me
Tell 'em this shit hot, nigga this shit hot
I'm a microphone fiend for the green leaves
Like Rhakim and Eric B
Have ya "mind playin tricks", like the Geto Boys
Damn right, y'all better be scared of me
Nobody can rap, quite like I can
Take a Muslim by a man and put his face in the sand
I'm the last mafioso on the MC copper
Make you say "Yo Layzie, don't pull the Glock!"
From the coupe to the watch, y'all don't see me
I went to commercial, break to pay these bills
Y'all thought I wasn't keepin it real
Like you PMD, you gots to chill
Feel where I'm comin from
Beat to a different drum
Everybody askin "Where the hell they get their rhythm from?"
I'mma tell you, go and get'chu some
Or get greeted with the hollow-point dum-dums
Dumb-dumb, come one, come all
Now can you feeel meee?
The best there is, the best there was
And the best there wiiilll beee
(Hook, Bizzy Bone)

(Verse 3, Bizzy Bone)
Introducing the gangsta-gangsta-gangsta
Baby we whistle my melody softly, hah
Lifted up, and I'm feelin lofty
Me Crispy Creme, with no caffeine
So you can keep your coffee
I likes my sticky-icky crystal clear with some chocolate toffee, c'mon!
I put the "Money in a Zip-Lock Bag"
Tell the lady look over the contract
Gotta go, gotta mash
Get wit me, and that's that
Another show, finna get more cash
I'm finna roll out fast
A wheel spinnin in the beginning
The women gettin in an elite, the fleet
The shit, I'm drift, can't see 'em, get 'em
Move me down, they wanna slow me down
They can't show me down, now slow down
Whoa now, whoa now
In the shade, low down, go up
What'chu think that I'mma tell you go down, grow up
Enemies come and get grown down, thrown down, torn down, thrown down
Take that bitch, get another one, pronto
It's just that man in us
And ain't know which to find
Now who the leader with a nine millimeter
And a dime and a grand to touch
Now Christ, who's everything around me
Heey, that's who found me
Give me a pound b, that purple haze
I'm on an air plane, air line ticket, and I'm still a little dazed
Rat race, no snitch, no games, no lames, no shame, no fame, still thug
Love me or just hate us, don't frame us, and that's what's up
(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
