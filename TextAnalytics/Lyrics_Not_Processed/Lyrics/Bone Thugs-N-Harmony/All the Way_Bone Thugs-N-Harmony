[Verse 1: Krayzie]
You willin to test the flesh oh yes
But don't even stress what you heard
Cuz nigga Bone Thugs together forever splittin apart is obsurd
I wish they'd stop wit all of these rumours
Cuz we ain't goin nowhere baby
This is for life..

[All the way]

[Verse 2:Wish]
Bless this seed gotta know where I come from
And you'll sell me ain't going back where I come from
Been blessed with division and when we speak they listen
Well nigga you asked we look and we laugh
Depleted 50% of that mission right in that hand

[All the way]

[Verse 3: Layzie]
Now nigga we did we went and we got
We did it alone by ourselves
Little help from E eternal we will him will neva forget him
Know now for wealth
Stood our ground and we put this down
It'll be my niggas we out on the grind
Together forever still one of a kind
Got love for the thugs that grind

[All the way]

[Verse 4: Bizzy]
They tellin me I was the one that was shoot up
And neva got 50/50 then we fillin em
Offer the rhythm and minimum gettin em

Now taties and gentlemen I don't want anymo problems
Gentlemen let's get paid to party
Givin em sumthin make it feel Bone Thugs-N-Harmony

[All the way]

[Hook]

[Verse 5:Bizzy]
It's Charles, Bryan, and Steven, Anthony and Stanley
Nigga this family in destiny yall

Mash the gigglin jigglin swervin and ribbonin
And while they crackin up off me
I must be invincible wit Bone Thugs-N-Harmony

[All the way]

[Verse 6: Krayzie]
In this world I'm simply tryna get rich and make a livin
I ain't really trippin on no fancy cars or massderah
Even though a nigga duty dippin
I keep my heat in my lap where I can reach it and pap

[All the way]

[Verse 7: Layzie]
This for makin pushes outta the bushes
And makin these hits stay move the streets
Rebels and warriors all ova the globe
Find their souls to the rockin feet
Maybe to me that's more than money
Better than anything I could imagine
All of ya souljahs keep on smashin
We could chill in the hood look mansion ansion

[All the way]

[Verse 8: Wish]
Everythings gone be a little nicer
Put your load on got a little lighter
Got rid of these bustin these hoes
But I must admit they sum the writer
And that's how ah belead dog
Ain't goin to the bottom wit yall
Nah and i wish of yall could see us bring

[All the way]

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Layzie]
Hey yo well lil nigga this Bone Thugs
Shoulda know by now we niggas for life
Pullin triggers for life
Gettin figures for life
Nigga done dig and brought to the light
Like Jeffrey Osbourne way back in the day
Better believe me when I tell you dog

[Singin] We goin all the way

[Verse 10: Bizzy]
How to bail me now better stoppin the psycho
Then slew they
Straight outta the foster home in Cleveland I escaped the Juve
And a little jury and a Shaun Gas army
Been makin money since niggas was doing they thang
Time fucked up the rhyme

[All the way]

[Verse 11: Wish]
Hey Mr. K. Ceiling do you know sumthin's wrong
Top of the line with the realest of thugstas
Ten years and they thought we'd be gone
But Oh No, soon as that little nigga Eazy
Let us put our foot in that door
We mashed we did we dashed
We did whateva till we get that dough

[All the way]

[Verse 12: Krayzie]
They know that we known for doing it
For can a thug is the street That'lil Eazy-E
But its on I keep tellin this niggas there'll neva be anotha Bone
If you goin this way you could go wit Kray
Cuz we [goin......]

[All the way]
Chorus til fade
