Blaze it up
This is for the weedheads, the weedheads, weedheads
Yup, yup (Tell 'em) This is what we need, yeah, to get weeded
--
As we roll blowin' on indo, indo
Top drop, feelin' the wind blow, yeah
We don' smoke the whole quarter pound but ain't know it
Been smokin' blunt for blunt around the clock
I got my choke on, choke on
Krayzie Bone
Where about my weed smokers at? My green leaf chokers at? If you raised up your hand, go ahead and smoke a sack
Don't hold back
Been puffin' trees ever since a nigga was nineteen; Fell in love when I seen green could help me write and sing
I never forget the day my nigga Layzie came home from school
Said he had got a drug from a dude, some Puerto Rican fool (Ooh) "You wanna smoke?" He said
I said, "Yeah"
Ain't never tried it before but you know; What the hell

Ain't never tried this reefa shit, but I'm finna try
My brother used to tell me, "If you smoke it, you'll get high" Thinkin' you can fly
Layzie lit it up and took a puff and he started coughin' and chokin'; I'm like "What the fuck? Let me try that" Puff, puff! Feelin' that headrush
Exhale, now I feel irate
"You got another one?" I'm buzzin' with my cousin and I'm lovin' how I'm feelin'
Man, that reefa got my ziggity, got me illin', got me chillin'

Now I'm high! Lil' Lay, man, I don't know about you dog, but I'm high
I'm wired up
You got some mo' then fire it up
Here's the line
Nigga, damn, they should've told me that reefa was so damn potent cause I wouldn't've been done smoked it
Hope we can get some mo' I like the addiction already
Even though I'm seein' purple people dancin' on the cieling
Nigga gigglin', that shit ain't even funny
And I got the rumbles in my tummy, got them munchies dog, I'm hungry

High ever since that day, that day
After I discovered weed and I smoked it, smoked it
I just ain't able to stay away, I roll another, smoke another, roll another, smoke another
Weed eases your mind, you mind
Get high and you'll find, you'll find you can fly...
