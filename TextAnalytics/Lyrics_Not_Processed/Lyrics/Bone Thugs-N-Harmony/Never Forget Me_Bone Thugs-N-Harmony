I'm gon' make sure you never forget me
{*cell door slams*} Konvict, Konvict...

[Hook: Akon]
Goin through the struggles every day on this pavement
In every hood I see 'em doin the same
There's a lot of haters that don't want me to make it
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget meeeee (forget me)
So that you never forget me, oh-ohhh-oh
So that you'll never forget meeeee (forget me)
So that you never forget me, oh-ohhh-oh

[Krayzie Bone]
When I'm dead and gone
They gon' remember me as bein one of the livest
Genuine ghetto survivors, when they think terror
Inside I pop in they mind, a silent killer
Straight out the ghetto a grimy nigga
With lyrics more potent than a viper's venom
One bite could kill 'em
When I get in 'em niggas never knew what'd hit 'em
Legends, for what we done did on the streets
And what we done spit on these records
Blessings, we take 'em and put 'em on beats
And we give 'em back, no question
Granddaddy of the Midwest, Krayzie Jackson
The lyrical serial killer, I feel I'm the illest
Of niggas that's askin about the mind I master
When it comes to the rhyme I'm faster
Than half of these niggas rappin
When it comes to the grind I'm mashin
No time for second chances
When it all goes down (down)
When they put me in my grave
It's "Fuck 'Em All" across my tombstone
And bury me with my gauge (gauge)

[Layzie Bone]
My reputation is solid gold
And my street cred is all polished y'all
Known as a little boss hog in the hood
Boy in my hood I'm a superstar
Niggas in the past try to hold a nigga down
But I put in my work and checked it, checked it
Now these niggas respect it
Knowin I'm the wrong one they wanna mess with
From the gutter, with my brothers
Knowin these ghetto streets they don't love us
Duckin these undercovers, these motherfuckers
Doin everything to try to bust us
But these suckas, know they can't touch us
They envy deep in they hearts
If they ever, try to rush us
Nigga they know we gon' rip 'em apart
Niggas go hard, from the start
Nigga this Nina Ross is my bodyguard
Fuck with mine and I'll charge
Little crazy-ass nigga at large
Wheelin cars, on these lanes
Niggas I never let go of my heat
Yeah, a stand-up man on his feet
Lil' Layzie Bone on the creep; 'member, me

[Hook]

[Wish Bone]
What I got to do for you not to forget
Who brought you that straight Thug spit
Sped up a little bit with gangsta talk
With that Harmony all over it, hey!
Bone sing (sing) do it mixed in with that street talk
And with no delay, Eazy-E let's get our creep on
And then he went home (home)
But it's all good (good)
He left the right ones
Through us he's still in the hood
Rest in peace (peace) E
Like him when I die I hope they remember me (me)
That's why I no lie when I reach you with these beats
Took a lot from nothin
Remember the Thugs for the songs that we sung
And makin it through that struggle, that struggle
It ain't easy believe me, we breezy believe it
Still goin on hustlin bein strong
But I do it so they remember me
