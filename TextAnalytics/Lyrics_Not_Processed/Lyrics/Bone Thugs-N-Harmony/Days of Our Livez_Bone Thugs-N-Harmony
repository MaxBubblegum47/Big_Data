[Pre-Chorus: Krayzie Bone + Layzie Bone]
Only time will tell who dies, (Only time will tell)
These are the days of our lives
Come, look deeply in my eyes
These are the days of our lives (My eyes)
See the murder mold our lives, (See the murder mold)
These are the days of our lives
These are the days of our lives (These are the days of our lives)
These are the days of our lives

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone + Layzie Bone]
Now, come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugs
More than thugs, we more than thugs (We more than thugs)
With just a little twist of harmony, bud-smokin' lethal warriors
Warriors, we warriors, (We warriors)
Now, come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugs
More than thugs, we more than thugs (We more than thugs)
With just a little twist of harmony, bud-smokin' lethal warriors
Warriors, we warriors, (We warriors)

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone + Wish Bone + Krayzie Bone]
Eternally thugs here I come tellin' them soldier stories
Been daily collectin' my lessons, without any questions
Without any questions, stressin' no restin', we journey this blessin'
Shiftin' the game, rearranging thangs
'Cause once the world was bringin' me down
Mesmerized, controlled by the other side, but the devil was in my town
Looking for me
But he won't get me in time, fucking with Bone, and he liking these rhymes
We rhyme, better believe it, all the time, nigga, we live
We straight up soldiers, bet a nigga done told ya, told ya
We rob before we go broke, nigga, we robbin' y'all, all of y'all, all y'all
Y'all my dawgs, if you call or you fall
You can bet on that nigga, when ever, that I will be there, lean on me
But let us get rid of the enemies, niggas be sayin', "Oh why, why?"
But if you think you can hang, hang, hang

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone + Layzie Bone]
Now, come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugs
More than thugs, we more than thugs (We more than thugs)
With just a little twist of harmony, bud-smokin' lethal warriors
Warriors, we warriors, (We warriors)
Now, come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugs
More than thugs, we more than thugs (We more than thugs)
With just a little twist of harmony, bud-smokin' lethal warriors
Warriors, we warriors, (We warriors)

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone + Wish Bone + Bizzy Bone]
Thuggin' in the studio, y'all know we roll hydro every time we rhyme
I'm high, look at me deeply in my eyes, I rise to the top of the game
No way did I have to run, no way did I have to turn
Sherm, but a lot of these niggas won't learn
But the money that I earn won't burn so come again
Better watch that MAC-10, nigga, this one's for me and my friends
We steadily rollin', I told ya, keep bringin' home platinum and gold ones
Pap-pap, put it all in the ground, yeah, Bone—yeah, we used to get down (Get down)
With the clack back, put another round—now, get down
Well, I must be blowed, some 'dro', when I roll my indo
Sittin' all alone on my window, to little Eazy—bless his soul, it's so cold (It's so cold)
Little Bizzy got stress for the peeps, the streets
And none of these police, ho-lice know me
Still want him cuffed up—bitch, no peace, no peace

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone + Layzie Bone]
Now, come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugs
More than thugs, we more than thugs (We more than thugs)
With just a little twist of harmony, bud-smokin' lethal warriors
Warriors, we warriors, (We warriors)
Now, come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugs
More than thugs, we more than thugs (We more than thugs)
With just a little twist of harmony, bud-smokin' lethal warriors
Warriors, we warriors, (We warriors)

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone + Krayzie Bone]
And it ain't no mystery the pistol be, and I better put it in the Mercedes
Little Ripsta's scriptures, sister, recieve me, I want me weeders
Till the end, end, baby, double me up, and get one for my friend
Twenty, twen', twen', we biddin' on bud, start the bid at a fin
So, who want a bag? Who want a bag? You want a bag? You want a bag? You got a bag—sold!
Send em' out of the door to the liquor store for the blunts to roll
Only my Lord can tell who dies
So pick up the puzzle and pieces and put it together; our lives
My lordy-Lord, maintain, it's hard 'cause I'm a soldier at war
'Cause everbody wanna try to bring out the devil in me
But the evil's embedded in me, weed keeps me at ease
Take notes, oh, no, 'cause here it comes
That murda mo' comin' to carry you home, you home
Woke up and they see when they pullin' the gauge out, murder
They put it up to your temple like, "We blow your brains out," die

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone + Layzie Bone]
Now, come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugs
More than thugs, we more than thugs (We more than thugs)
With just a little twist of harmony, bud-smokin' lethal warriors
Warriors, we warriors, (We warriors)
Now, come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugs
More than thugs, we more than thugs (We more than thugs)
With just a little twist of harmony, bud-smokin' lethal warriors
Warriors, we warriors, (We warriors)

Now, come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugs (Only time will tell who dies)
More than thugs, we more than thugs (We more than thugs)
With just a little twist of harmony, bud-smokin' lethal warriors (Come, look deeply in my eyes)
Warriors, we warriors, (We warriors)
Now, come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugs (See the murder mold our lives)
More than thugs, we more than thugs (We more than thugs)
(These are the days of our lives)
