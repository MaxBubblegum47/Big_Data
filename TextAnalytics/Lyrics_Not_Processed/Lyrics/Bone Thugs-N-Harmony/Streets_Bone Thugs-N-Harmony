[Layzie Bone]
Know why I sound so raw cause I'm down by law
Try to play me cause I'm rappin I will break yo' jaw
Catch a nigga in these streets, make him take clothes off
Leave you dead butt-naked, man you fuckin with a boss
Cross paths with me, I'm in the hood, all in Watts, in the Bronx
In Decatur, all around the devil block, trouble knocks
I'm ready for 'em, niggas they know I'm ready for them
I'm a artist, I'm a deadly poet so I'm heated heavy for it
Why you lookin for me nigga with yo' lookin ass
Meet me in the club, all my niggas get to whoopin ass
Then a nigga sue me, sue me
Nigga 'posed to be thug, nigga 'posed to be streets
Pull yo' skirt down nigga cause we smellin yo' pussy
The whole bottom line is you can't fuck with me
Will.i.am the ghetto {"You can find it all.."}
Will.i.am the ghetto {".. in the street"}
Cause I'm a thug by nature, "Thug By Nature"
Gotta keep thuggin I'm thuggin, gotta keep thuggin I'm thuggin

[Hook: will.i.am]
If you lookin, fo' me, I'll be, rollin
You could find me in the streets
You, you could find me in the streets
If you lookin, fo' me, I'll be, rollinnnn
You could find me in the streets
You, you could find me in the streets
If you lookin!

[The Game]
It's the black rag assassin, 44-mag blastin
Black ski mask throwin shots out a Dodge Magnum
Gangbang forever, put the barrel on the head of the devil
With homicidal intentions, I reign terror
On any clique or squad, you niggas bitch you fraud
I'm a tickin time-bomb that'll finish the job
Lyrical damager, one-two punch crush you amateurs
Box and watch me execute like Cockton
My flow pipin hot scorchin, proceed with caution
Murder any MC or soul that's lost
When I'm ridin with them Bone Thugs
Black Glocks and chrome slugs parked on the block with the nose up
Get ready for the Face/Off, Nicolas Cage
Ain't got shit on a nigga with a fuckin grenade
One man army, only two things in the world could calm me
Wet pussy and that bomb ass chronic
I'll never back down, never back down
Never back down now that the Bone Thugs back {*blaow*}

[Krayzie Bone]
Now we the niggas in the black Dickies and steel-toe boots
Stompin' that nigga that got a pistol and he still won't shoot
Cause he a ho, like half of these niggas is rappin I'mma let you know
These niggas is actin and puttin on a fashion show
We done checked these niggas
Met these niggas, man I don't respect these niggas
I'm a real motherfuckin T-H-U-G original
Hate to be a critic but yo' shit I ain't feelin though
You niggas is elementary, I got history
Lyrically you can't see me, physically I'll bring you misery
Seriously, you niggas ain't been hearin me - but listen
To these other niggas hits, you hear my twist, they do my shit
But it's all good cause we keep it all hood
And when we see niggas we roll dawg like a hog should
Just let me put the motherfuckin money on the wood
Bitch niggas would be Bone if they could
But I'mma shut 'em down, I'mma shut 'em down
I'mma shut 'em down, Bone niggas known not to fuck around

[Hook]

[Wish Bone]
I got my hand on my balls
Grippin Nina Ross, hood star, shit could be my boulevard
You know I'm in the streets, I ain't hard to reach
On some cool shit or some beef shit nigga I'm in the streets
This ain't my only occupation, hittin avenues
Chasin paper always (always) and I know how to get it
In pissy hallways (hallways) in a raw way
You could get it how you live, nigga step the wrong way
I let it bang b-bang bang, I'm the streets for real
And I love it but you know how the gameplay got me ready to kill
Somebody, but it's all good
With these shows in my streets, nigga all good
Gotta keep stackin my paper like it's all I know
These niggas is playin, I gotta get it lock and load
Winter through summer, summer back through the winter
We hustlin dawg, hustlin hustlin hustlin
Give it all ya got, give it all ya got, hustlin
Niggas that's talkin about we ain't out - WATCH yo' mouth!
