"Yeah she has a gun and I went and got her a gun permit!
Now they didn't have to shoot that old lady down like that
They didn't have to do that!
It's one old woman in that house
I've got burglar bars there to try to protect her
I've got mercury lights out there to keep it bright and light
I'm as mad as hell! And somebody's gon' answer to that!"
"Police are defending the shooting death of a 92 year-old woman
It happened as plain-clothes officers burst into her home last night
To serve a search warrant for drugs
Police say they made an undercover drug buy at the house earlier in the day
The woman's niece said there were never drugs in the house
And her aunt lived alone and probably just panicked
The family is furious."

It's so many ways to die - ohh no
It's so many ways to fly - steady as we go
It's so many ways to rise high, high
Cause life can't pass us by no mo'

Chillin on my momma's front porch, I'm watchin
Sittin here reminiscin on how hot the block gets
From right here I can truly see how crooked the cops is
My vision gettin blurry as I look at my options
I could, just let 'em drop me or I could cock it and pop it
The way they murdered Oscar was preposterous nonsense
They talkin with their Glocks, conversation is violence
And they wonder why society is criminal-minded
They never gon' change, come around my way
Another one shot down slain while the cop got praised
It's hard to maintain when they supposed to protect us
You or me could be the next one bleedin injustice

Even though the world shows no affection (no affection)
You gotta keep it movin, got to keep on steppin (got to keep on steppin)
The Man Upstairs is our only protection
It's very necessary, you remember this is temporary (temporary)

Time's tickin all day, let me swoop up in yo' neck of the woods
Everybody tend to they own hustle, got much respect, that's all good
Turn on the news it's no surprise to see
Police brutality and worse they out here gunnin us down in the street
Abuse of authority ain't even it
Rather the vast majority of 'em is too damn incompetent
When is enough gon' be enough I ask
I know we all tryin to live life free from all the madness
It's sad enough you gotta watch out or get jacked
But the worst one's the criminal that's hidin behind the badge
You got a problem it may be a waste of time to call 'em
Cause the only thing they bringin is more problems so why bother?

Political think I'm illiterate, literal me I get so cynical
It's pitiful livin in minimal, general's animals stick with their tentacles
I'm more alive, I'm just tryin to fight evil
Me and my people, my people and me, I'm still single
And even though I look meager I'm eager to make some money
My heart is more than a direction, my protection from dummies
Hold your hand like babies, feel my hand gettin stuck
Josiah acted a fool, Rasu, 7th Sign, what...

I'm lookin around the world, my temporary city it makes my heart hurt
Feelin the struggles of my brothers it takes some hard work
Bein raised by single mothers the case was caught first
And they got daddy in the pen, gotta face the law's worst
No guidance we dyin, we barely survivin, the knowledge is there, they ain't providin
They starvin us out to keep us divided so they can get money and hide it
Operation Silence, the government got some secrets they ain't tellin
Cause if they let you know they can't convict you felon
But they done slipped and let the Thugs know the deal
We comin back to save the ghetto, let the truth be revealed
If we all get on the level and exhibit some skills
We can all get out of debt and we can pay off these bills and just chill
