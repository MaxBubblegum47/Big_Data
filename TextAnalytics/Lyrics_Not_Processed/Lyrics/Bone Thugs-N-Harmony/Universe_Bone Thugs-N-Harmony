Even though I hustle, even though I struggle

Layzie, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh
Universe, one verse, five's the best
Layzie, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh
Universe, one verse, five's the best

[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony - all alternating lines]
Layzie, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh
So amazin, blazin, nigga it's just the five
The Uni-5 right off the 9-9, 9-9
Let's flow, show 'em how we the greatest
They listen up, yup, put some magic in the music
Put some classic in your music - and put some tragic in your music
And make it platinum when you do it - and feed your family while you do it
That's how my Thugstas get it crackin, attackin and move to it
Make it happen, take advantage, do that and act true to it
We're ready for anything and we sing to make through it
No time for delays, back down, we can't do it
Doin our thang, see the Bone remain strong, y'all knew it

[Interlude: Bone Thugs]
So give it all you got, give it all you got, don't stop
Give it all you got, give it all you got, don't stop
Still maintainin got quick flow flamin hot
Try us if you think we're not live enough to take your spot

[Chorus]

[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony - all alternating lines]
Layzie, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh
Never met another that could spit it like us
The design and precisest flow so the nicest
Righteous ices, wicked with the style and the wildest
Been up the come up - since our childhood
Sound good - just like our orchestra when we 'round wood
Late night - burnin barrels; play fight - singin carols
Stage fright - nigga never, we be on the level!
The World's Enemy - rebel never settle for less
No them haters ain't on our, level - incredible, yes we are the best
We gets live, it'll be no others liver
Wise when they ride with us - soul survivors

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony - all alternating lines]
Layzie, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh
United we stand even though we might fall out
It's all in the fam if family members brawl out
Whenever whatever, never say never, yes we goin all out
We stuck with a plan, them Thugstas boys made it
Now we keep 'em stuck in a trance, it's hard to shake it
With that lyrical combination that flipped it and swept the nation
Mystical, creator, motivator of true innovations
It's music don't abuse it, just use it and evade your pain
Don't let them harmonies fool ya, still take aim
Comin to let it go, we show no mercy to lames
A whole fifth sippin, that ounce of kush we smokin mayne

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
