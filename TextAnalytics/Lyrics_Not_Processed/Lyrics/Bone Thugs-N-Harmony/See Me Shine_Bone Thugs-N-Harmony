[Intro: Krayzie]
They don't wanna see me shine, don't wanna see me shine
Don't wanna see me fly, don't wanna see me ride
They don't wanna see me shine, don't wanna see me shine
Don't wanna see me fly, don't wanna see me ride

[Hook 2X: Krayzie Bone] + (J Rush)
Why they gotta hate-hate? Steady hatin mine-mine
Smilin in my face-face, fakin on the side
They don't wanna see me shine (cause they don't wanna)
(They don't wanna, they don't wanna see me shiiiiiine)

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
As long as I'm alive no hater gon' ever stop my drive
I, get it and make it multiply, anything else is suicide
Enemy of the world, that's I; energy of an eagle eye
See no evil and hear no lie, niggas don't wanna see me fly
Higher than a rocket ship, life is not rocket science
Every day is documented, all of my time is occupied
I'm gon' grind, I'm gon' shine, ballin 'til the end of time
Hate on me then it's all fine, you just ain't no friend of mine

[Verse 2: Flesh-N-Bone]
I'm tryin to focus on bigger and better thangs
With so many odds against me I had to step up my game
Imagine problems with crooked coppers, why they wanna go there?
Tried to pop me, lock me, but couldn't knock me off my square
I'm not surprised, you haters wanted to see Flesh stretched out
Without one Thug, while I'm steady stressin out
But we doin our own thang, the Bone thang
You suckas fail every time tryin to stop my shine

[Hook 2X: Krayzie Bone] + (J Rush)
Why they gotta hate-hate? Steady hatin mine-mine
Smilin in my face-face, fakin on the side
They don't wanna see me shine (cause they don't wanna)
(They don't wanna, they don't wanna see me shiiiiiine)

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Stay away, fade away playa hater
Stay away, fade away, playa hater
I need you to stay away, fade away playa hater
Stay away, fade away, playa hater
24/7 grindin, tryin to get my shine on
That don't give 'em a reason to hate me, hate me, hate me
But I know my mind's strong, none of you suckas can break me
Ha, nothin can save ya now, they caught the Krayzie vapors
Stay away, fade away, playa haters
There's really no need to be crowdin me cause I can't deal with you haters surroundin me
Houndin me tryin to get my paper, hard to keep my faith up
It's time for me to raise up, and do the sucka shaker
Truuuuuuuuue T-H-U-G's
And we come to kill you, kill you, kill you
I think they might be scared (might be scared)
To let me shine cause I'm a righteous playa; I'm a righteous {*echoes*}

[Hook 2X: Krayzie Bone] + (J Rush)
Why they gotta hate-hate? Steady hatin mine-mine
Smilin in my face-face, fakin on the side
They don't wanna see me shine (cause they don't wanna)
(They don't wanna, they don't wanna see me shiiiiiine)

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
See meeeee - stack your paper they hate my grind
Catch meeeee - push that's why I got my swagger down
But never slip in the clip in, I know they want my life
Any weakness, not here, they know that Wish gon' ride, ride
Hit the streets with that better love
Watch out if you kiss and tell, you know not to show 'em love
It's just that they talk too much, they never know who to trust
And just when you get enough, a target you will become
That's just the game they play

[Verse 5: Bizzy Bone]
It's the devil's perpetuation, tryin to take my innocence
It's my retaliation, I don't need no ignorance
I'm standin against this army with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Harmony
Danger is just a part of me like it's stuck in my arteries
These poor playa haters are the motivators, but I get my paper paper
Same rappers that hate us call for verses so we can tape for them
Critics we can't escape from them, don't you drink too much Hennessy
Ain't no time to be slippin, we the world's worst enemy

[Hook 2X: Krayzie Bone] + (J Rush)
Why they gotta hate-hate? Steady hatin mine-mine (I just gotta knowwwwww)
Smilin in my face-face, fakin on the side
They don't wanna see me shine
(They don't wanna see me shine, they don't wanna see me shine)

[J Rush]
So many people said we wouldn't (take it)
So many people said we couldn't (make it)
So I made it up in my mind
[Krayzie] So I made up in my mind I'll take it
I made it up in my grind
[Krayzie] So I made up in my mind I'll take it
... I just gotta knowwww
I just need to know! (While you keep hating, I'mma keep shining)
I just gotta know (While you keep hating)
I just gotta know (I'ma keep shining)
Why they wanna hate on me? (While you keep hating)
Why they wanna steal my shine? (I'ma keep shining)
Why they wanna hate on me? (While you keep hating)
Why they wanna steal my shine? (I'ma keep shining)
I just gotta know (While you keep hating)
I just gotta know (I'ma keep shining)
I just gotta know (While you keep hating)
I just gotta know (I'ma keep shining)
See me shiiiiine (While you keep hating)
See me shiiiiine (I'ma keep shining)
Ohh see me shiiiiine (While you keep hating)
Ohh see me shiiiiine (I'ma keep shining)
Yeahhhh (I'ma keep shining, I'mma keep shining)

[Krayzie Bone]
They don't wanna see me shine (I'ma keep shining, I'mma keep shining)
