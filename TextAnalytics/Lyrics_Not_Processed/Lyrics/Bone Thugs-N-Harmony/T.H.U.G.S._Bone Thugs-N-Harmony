[Chorus: Layzie] + (Wish) + {Bizzy}
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Even though I'm makin moneyyyyy)
{Gotta do what I, do what I, do what I, do what I do}
Gotta struggle, gotta hustle, gotta do what I do
(Even though I'm makin moneyyyyy)
{Gotta do what I, do what I do}
Gotta struggle, gotta hustle, gotta do what I do

[Layzie Bone]
And I believe, that we must confront the past
In order to capitalize on the future
Because in our present times and turmoils, it is inevitable
So focus, did you hear what I said?
I said focus, on our children
We must, concentrate on education, and pride
Not only mental development, but physical development
So that we can stand united, and kick our enemies ASS! (that's right)
Can I get a witness?
Now time is of the essence, so stand tall, chest out, chin up
Be proud to be a part of this nation of thugs
And remember one thing, that the clock is tickin!

[Chorus]

[Wish Bone]
First off, I wanna know, how many people really believe in the Lord?
Because if you don't, I think you need to start headin for the exit
Because what I'm 'bout to say is just real, it's too real
Like me and my dogs Bone Thugs, you know what I'm sayin?
Hey! Why every time we get mad
I mean when we get mad, why we tear up our own SHIT?
That don't make no damn sense!
We gotta get it together, you know what I'm sayin? Wooo!
I think I'd do anything for my babies cause I love my children
I brought them here, I give them, I feed them, and they mine
And we bringin you the Thugs nation
An organization of nothin but thugs, nothin but THUGS!
We are, we are, the Thug, nation!

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Soldiers! All praise is due to the creator, first and foremost
I would like to read to you out of the book of Babylon
Chapter one, it is written in Braille
What you feel tonight is not just anger my children (yeah!)
It is not just oppression (yeah!)
It is not confusion, it is solution (yeah!)
The same ghetto in which we have been institutionalized in
Has become our training camps
And the minister of defense is here to you tonight
To tell you that the target is no longer our brothers and sisters (yeah!)
It is no longer our children (yeah!)
Tonight is not the beginning, it is the rejuvenation of a revolution
The revolution that our mothers and our fathers have abandoned us (yeah!)
So I will struggle with you, I will take council with you (yeah)
I will eat with you
And may God be with all of his soldiers
I said, may God be with all of his soldiers! (YEAH!)
But without the creator then this isn't possible
Without further adieux, I bring to you, Chief LeathaFace (yeah)
My friend, and your chief

[Krayzie Bone]
Now where my thugs at?
I said, where my goddamn thugs at?! (Right here nigga!)
Now what we tryin to organize here today
Is more than just a gang of niggas
We tryin to organize more than just a posse of niggas
We tryin to organize a goddamn army
(Thug nation nigga, Thug motherfuckin Thug nation, Thug nation!)
Now we them niggas gon' keep it real
While these other bitch niggas keep it fake
We gon' let them motherfuckers know what's goin on down here
In the goddamn streets; can I get a "Hell yeah" (hell motherfuckin yeah!)
... Now I gotta say, the mission is to make money
The enemy is the police, Mr. Fed, Mr. CIA (fuck the Feds!)
Mr. Wanna-See-Yo'-Thug-Ass-in-Jail (fuck that)
I think it's time we start patrollin the police
And let them see how it feels, to be up under surveillance
Let them see how it feels, to have THEY phone tapped
Let them see how it feels
To have a strange guard inside yo' motherfuckin house
We 'bout to ride

[Chorus] - repeat 2X (second repeat minus first line)

[Bizzy Bone - over Chorus]
Fuck the police (fuck the police)
I said fuck the CIA (fuck the CIA)
Fuck the FBI (fuck the FBI)
Fuck the IRS and bust, we ain't hatin

[Wish] Even though I'm makin moneyyyyy...
