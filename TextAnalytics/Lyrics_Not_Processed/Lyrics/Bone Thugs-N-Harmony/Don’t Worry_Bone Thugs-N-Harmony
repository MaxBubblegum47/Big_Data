Everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna be alright now

Everything's gonna be alright now

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
So don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Now why did they kill him
It's one of my niggas is dreamin' schemin on making a million
Tryin' feed they children and police keep coming around
And keep tryin' to beat you down, and take you out
Nigga don't worry God don't like evil
Shit is so clear that they can't even see through
But no matter what we do (matter what we do)
We gon' be strugglin' forever running forever
The way that I see it won't get no better
Until armageddon goes down it's not a legend
It's kinda hard to view, paradise
But if you just try close your eyes you can view it
But reality hits you soon as you open your eyes you find
That you still live a fucked up life
And the streets done took over your mind
Figure you gotta survive, so somebody got to die
You just wanna break down and cry
But asking God to come help us please, why?

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
So don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang

[Verse 2: Wish Bone]
Some ah y'all niggas really can't fight
Betta get it together, betta act right
Cause when you fuck wid Bone
Betta come wid somethin', betta have yo shit right
And don't be planning no feud on nuthin' you heard, nigga
He say she say get you fucked up killa
And I'm gon' ride, won't lose no sleep over nuthin'
You can save the frontin'
But all these years, face to face, ain't nobody said nuthin'
Livin' in these wicked days
Tryin' to get over my wicked ways
Time after time I know we tried
But losing this life game, damn
I don't wanna go out like that - not me
Lately Bone got what you want
Physically you don't wanna bleed
A la la la la la la
Hit 'em hard it's gonna be alright
Alright alright

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
So don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
And don't you worry bout, a damn thang
And don't you worry bout, a damn thang
Wid all odds, against us
When the guard got me running for the fences
Aiming at these henchmen litigate shells
I'm teaming my clip wid the extra extension
I sit in my basment like it's a crackhouse, bored
Blackout cause I was paranoid, he enjoys what I avoid
The courts ah bowl ah, crooks
Cause bitches won't put money on yo books
Destroy double eyed dotted watch devil smiles wid a cush
Gotta sell chronic to get me up some mellofied timing televised
The crucified promised in ah my ish nobody can stop us
Where the shoot out?
How many niggas you killed?
How many niggas for real?
Like Mary Louelle as long as I live
Forty five strategized like,Ohh dow
Niggas can blast at me
Bitches can pass me
Fuck ah chicken and let's get on

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
So don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang

[Verse 4: Flesh N Bone]
I remember like yesterday, way back in the day coming up
Moms used to read to me everyday, through the evening
Even through the afternoon and at dawn ah book of songs
So I'm wondering off through the wilderness
Somewhere in the valley of the shadow of death
Want to hunt me down all the need for people
Heaven I wonder will the devil catch me shall prevail
Lately even heaven is flashy sick of this amazed envy
And it ain't nuthin' to see and believe in heaven in front of you
That's what I'm having a de ja vu
Lord when I lay down down to sleep
I pray for the Lord and the Holy Ghost bless my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake up, wake up, wake up ,wake up
I pray for the Lord to have mercy on our souls oh please Lord take us
I say to my momma peep no no more crying drying eyes
Nigga locked up at wayside
Couldn't even pay respect to my stepdad when he died
So finally got a release bid and I slide back to the county
Back to the 5-5 ride fore I touch back home
Don't worry bout a damn thang
Everything finna be al-right
Off to the door so bright like a knight in shining armour
Hug my wife my sons my daughter
Ain't no more reason to even bother

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Say don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang

[Verse 5: Layzie Bone]
Look nigga I ain't worried bout nothing
Cause it's a little thing I know called faith
All you need is much as a mustard seed
And the Lord will keep you safe
Whateva don't kill you will make you stronger
I promise you that just keep on pushing
If you slip you fall and you hurt yourself
Then the Lord will provide your cushion
Determination, rules the nation whateva you facing just be a man
Believing in death before dishonor shake the drama and take a stand
For ah nigga like me see it didn't come easy
Ah nigga had to struggle and fight
At ah point and time in my life
It's like ah nigga just can't get it right
To all of my family Layzie loves ya
And I never take shit for granted
Feeling so wicked off in this planet
Man fuck tryin' to understand it
That's why I stay focused thugging and loc'dus
Stacking my bricks till I form the fifth
Momma never said it'd be like this
But nigga I'm ready for anything
Remember to never count your eggs before they hatch
About precision timing and vision
Get up and go and don't turn back
If you ah soldier and you know it hold ya head up high
And keep stompin' in yo big black boots and don't worry

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Say don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
