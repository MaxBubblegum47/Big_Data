[Intro: Don Jagwarr]
Anamanam call me Don Jagwarr
Wicked, Bad man
Down with the Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
Bad man, gangsta for life
We don't hurt people, we murder them

[Flesh-N-Bone]
(Murk and lay these bitches, uh)
I had to drop the card on some nigga that fucked up bad and dropped the ball
Ain’t no thang to doin' em dead
To put in work, Flesh enforce da law
Whoever wanna test these nuts come up on and try to [?] it
Got something to rip yo guts open
No they don’t really want it

[Layzie Bone]
Smell the murder in the air
Yeah, don't be scared
Hold your breath nigga this St. Clair
Where nothin' is fair, playa
Run up on me that's if you dare
The bullet'll tear a hole in your body, you better beware
So walkin' jack moves, you never gon' knock me out my square

[Wish Bone]
Better get him, no problem
You hostile suckas I get rid of
I see him, dispose of, no conscience
I deliver the realer
Rated R, hands on you
Fast closer, come through with nothin’ left
(Shh yeah) Attitude's cold, no sleep lost
Fuck it, Let it go

[Bizzy Bone]
Then I come to kill you
What am I standin' here holdin' this knife for?
Blood drippin' to the floorboard
What did you do?! (did you do?)
You must've hurt one of my kids
Or said somethin' stupid about the Lord (that I heard)

[Krayzie Bone]
You see when it comes to original lyrical I'm in a miracle
I snuck in a couple subliminals, speed up the rhythm and leavin' em critical
Murder them minimum
All them, they gon' come get redrum
One verse, snuff 'em all
Murk you (murk you, murk you)

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone & 
Don Jagwarr
]
You tried to run up on me
So we gon' have to put that, put that murder on you (on you) (Pump, pump, pump, pump)
Jump up, come up they gon' see
Them see niggas get vicious wicked what the Bone do, Bone do! (Bone do, do, do, do)
Bone fire fire, blood splatter splatter

[?] scatter scatter, let 'em rott (rott)
(Buck, buck, buck)
Bone fire fire, blood splatter splatter

[?] scatter scatter, let 'em rott (rott)
(Buck, buck, buck)

[Bizzy Bone]
You know you crazy when niggas wanted you dead, you want them dead too
Red dot, pop, pop, pop, pop
Now, let me blast you, let me blast you
Pull out my pistol blow, your brains out
Wake up in the same doctor's hands
Say I love you man (Same [?])

[Layzie Bone]
Twelve gauge under the trench
I'm leavin' you drenched, makin' you paint blood
Ever since I got off the bench
I'm playin' the lynch, haters straight up
Say what? We make up to break up but wake up
Them Cleveland niggas is straight thugs
And lookin' for shit to shake up

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Finna the shock my the way to the brain
Clear the point from every stock
If you need it, believe we got
It's all just "What the fuck your prob?"
I try to stay cool, calm, and keep my shit collected
Unless we only gon' use a few rounds and start wiping away sections

[Wish Bone]
Dump, dump, dump, dump on em'
Get caught boy on the wrong corner
Hit 'em boss, Not big on the talk
I'm sick, lay 'em out like pneumonia
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
I'm splittin' muthafuckas one shot straight head
No remorse, thug force, no need to beg I'm comin' prepared

[Krayzie Bone]
Strapped, strapped and ready to ride
Got the gat right at ya mind
We ready to put that murder on you on you
(Pump, pump, pump, pump)
Straight to they heart
Murda, murda! All day they fall

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone & 
Don Jagwarr
]
(You-you-you-you)
You tried to run up on me
So we gon' have to put that-put that murder on you (on you) (Pump, pump, pump, pump)
Jump up, come up they gon' see
Them see niggas get vicious wicked what the Bone do, Bone do! (Bone do, do, do, do)
Bone fire fire, blood splatter splatter

[?] scatter scatter, let 'em rott (rott)
(Buck, buck, buck)
Bone fire fire, blood splatter splatter

[?] scatter scatter, let 'em rott (rott)
(Buck, buck, buck)
(You-you-you-you)
You tried to run up on me
So we gon' have to put that-put that murder on you (on you) (Pump, pump, pump, pump)
Jump up, come up they gon' see
Them see niggas get vicious wicked what the Bone do, Bone do! (Bone do, do, do, do)

[Outro: Don Jagwarr]
Murda on 'em and I may say
Murda on 'em and I may say
Murda on 'em and I may say buck, buck, buck!
Murda on 'em and I may say
Murda on 'em and I may say
Murda on 'em and I may say buck, buck, buck!
Murda on 'em and I may say
Murda on 'em and I may say
Murda on 'em and I may say buck, buck, buck!
Murda on 'em and I may say
Murda on 'em and I may say
Murda on 'em and I may say buck, buck, buck!
