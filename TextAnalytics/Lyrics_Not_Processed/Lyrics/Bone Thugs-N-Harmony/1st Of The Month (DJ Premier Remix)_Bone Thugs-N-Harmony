She said, "I'm gonna run and go get my stamps
Watch and make sure no one snatches my check"

Foe forty bucks but ain't nobody ride that rita
Hop on the 10 to the click
Ready to get 'em up with-a me thugs and to cash that dum

Saint Claire got much to offer whether it be weed on 93
Or off on the Glock, Glock for some dollars, so
Get a bag of dope and a quarter roll, oh
Most all of my niggas got the same
And we gonna roll it all up to smoke
Hittin' that reefer hydro, you know the cut, so fuck them po-po
Toss all that llello, and we're gonna say no
Runnin' through the alley and into the melee

But I gotta save, gotta come up, put my rocks on the cut
When I get high, nigga, blaze that blunt, huh

Count up my profits and add it to the stash
Gotta watch my back see for niggas that's tryin' to rob me, fool
But never no shorts, no losses
Dumpin', keepin' this niggas up off me see
Gotta search the whole block, spend a couple of bills

But it's the 1st so I'm getting my hustle on
Hop on the phone, calling up Krayzie Bone
Wanna know did you O.G check come?

(Yo, brother, let's get drunk)
And I'm coming with blunt after blunt of this skunk
Nigga T just put me down
Oh God, how I love when the 1st come around
Now I'm feelin' black and mild, headed cross town
'Cuz niggas the 1st to get celebrated
Rushin' to the block 'cuz I wanna get faded
Lookin' all wild 'cuz I'm getting me hair braided
We heavy off into this game
True to the 1st just call me that pro slang
Them nickels and dimes and 20's and 50's
The 1st be the day for the dope man
Slangin' that cocaine fool and I'm working late tonight
And all them fiends be lovin' them thugs
'Cuz I got them rocks for them pipes
Come, come with them ease
I gotta get paid on the 1st, gotta blaze up my spliff
Get live with the Bone Thugs, Poetic Hustlas in the graveyard shift
