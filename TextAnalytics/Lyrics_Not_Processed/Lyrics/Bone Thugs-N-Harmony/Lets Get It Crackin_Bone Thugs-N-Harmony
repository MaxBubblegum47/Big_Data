Come on, come on, come on, come on/ Baby, I got the cush and a bottle patron so let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin' baby/ Let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin'
Layzie Bone
Let me get this crackin', what's happenin'? Yeah, I'm all about my paper stackin'/ I'm a floss on the scene when I feel like flashin'/ Check the record, I went way past platinum/ My occupation, I'm smashin' takin' anything I want cause I got the bacon/ I'm a keep it shakin', these moves I'm makin'/ Everything to prove, no time is wastin'/ These niggas hatin' but that ain't nothin' new/ Niggas die slow when the Thugs slide through, yeah/ Three deep in that Bently coupe, a nigga pull to the club, like what it do/ I'm a fool with a swag, I'm a tool in a bag/ Nigga so clean I don't need to brag/ Pretty girls on my, try to leave with half, but they fuck wit'cha boy cause they see the cash/ I'm a buy the bar, hit the floor/ Stackin' up the club, cause I'm blazin' droll/ I'm a do it real big till I'm faded, yo/ And I'm the man 'round here, I'm amazin', ho/ This Layzie flow got me mad respect, and if a nigga disrespect, I'm a have his neck/ A lot of niggas in the past that I had to check, they found out I was playin' with a half a deck, yep
-Chorus-Will.i.am-
Come on, come on, come on, come on/ Baby, I got the cush and a bottle patron so let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin' baby/ Let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin'
Bizzy Bone
A little something for the ladies, gettin' that money by any means/ Who get with the playa-type, thuggish ruggish, from the hood with good genes/ Who kick it in high heels, plenty tank tops, camoflague fatigues or thongs clear to the vision so you can see some good things/ Stretch marks? Body smoother than marble floors in the Hamptons/ Living large in a condominium or mini mansion/ Side kick, mobile phone, free, flip like Kurt/ I'm sort of religious, superstitious, but I ain't scared to flirt/ I'm from the dirt, root and soot/ Came up on my own foot/ Used to hang with the crooks, I keep a job on my books/ I took my chance with many girls, and still I look for the woman/ I like it crazy, sexy and cool; Waterfalls, good lookin'/ I can remember back in school, being judged by Chips/ And so I hooked up with the Bone Thugs, suddenly I'm the shit/ And baby momma's drama, common dilemas and problems/ And now, I'm single, ready to mingle/ Holla, holla, holla, holla
Krayzie Bone
Now I'm tryin' to get crackin', tryin' to get into some action/ So come and take a ride with Krayzie Jackson/ Don't worry about the weed or drank, I got some/ This potent dope, let's smoke and choke/ I can put you on a lovely level where you never been/ Especially is you're stressed and depressed, yes, I got the medicine/ Sippin' a little bit of Patron, let me help you in the zone/ Put some Thug music on, something like this, something like a Bone song, and oh, don't ease your mind, unwind/ Let's slide just a little bit closer/ Just feel my vibe, and chill, get high/ Hey now (Hey now) What'chu receive-a (What'chu receve-a) Ecstacy if you try this a reefa/ We rollin' blowin'/ Potent potions got you open, it's got you focused/ Let's smoke some more then
-Chorus-Will.i.am-
Come on, come on, come on, come on/ Baby, I got the cush and a bottle patron so let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin' baby/ Let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin'
Wish Bone
When I'm gone on the Patron, have me humpin' all night long, long/ Heavy breathin' she all good, but I can't seem to reason/ So I guess I'm too high/ Turn it over, let her ride (Let her ride) Let her get hers two more times, I guess that's what I'd rather do/ But that liquor brings that attitude, and I might have to down a nigga/ Let off a round or two; Watch how they scatter, nigga (Nigga) Thugsta's pull triggers, fool/ Ain't nothin' new, you know how we do it, do'/ It's an everyday thang, thang/ Follow nothin' but thugsta's rules/ We can drank, we can drank/ We can smoke, we can smoke/ Hit the weedman, hit the store 'fore it close/ And we gotta keep it goin' till early in the morning/ I'm a POD, so we gotta keep it goin' cause I can get higher, higher/ If you can get higher, higher, then we can stay right, right/ You know ain't no party liver
Will.i.am
We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here/ We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here/ We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here/ We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here, over here, over here...
-Chorus-Will.i.am-
Come on, come on, come on, come on/ Baby, I got the cush and a bottle patron so let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin' baby/ Let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin'
