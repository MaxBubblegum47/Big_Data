Aaaahhh! (pray, pray, and we pray, pray, pray)

Look what we've done! (look what we've done, done, done)
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we’ve done! (lord, what have we done, done, done?)

[Krayzie Bone]
Everybody’s gone crazy, amamzed that it ain’t the same
Their faith has swayed! Everything done got a little bit stranger
Major complications plague the days
Everybody caught up in the fame and bright lights
While so many gonna swing in the night life
Stabbin’ ourselves with so many pains!
Life’s like really leavin’ me plain as I fight to try to make it out of satan’s
System
But really all they gotta do is shape the world
Make the world realize we must escape this world!
Hopin’ I can get up outta here with my integrity and come up on a better
Me and try to do it big
Do it big and through it to the heavenly
Won’t be no hell for me, just paradise (dise, dise ahh!, ahh!)
So what you gonna do, what you gonna do?(do, do, heee heee!)
When the new world order come for you. (for you, for you, ahh!, ahh!)
All you can do, what you can do is recognize the truth!
Realize these signs could pertain to you too! (too, too)

[Hook - Michael Jackson and Krayzie Bone]

What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we’ve done! (lord, what have we done, done, done?)

[Bizzy Bone]
It’s just for comfortability!
It’s killin’ me floatin’ rock already we damage the ozone
Ain’t nothin’ been hot as the sun since steady b flex his authority!
And what may be important to me, electricity’s older than trees
And that’s why the lighting be crackin’ the sky
Precious the metal was meltin’, but what about me?
When it comes to the mind, core, and the animals stick with us
B go with fire, entangle the body, the brain, and security, visual forces are
Not with us, why?
And the timing is dire! (ahh oohh)
Oh, I’m rich I feel so elated it’s time to go. I love you baby
Before and after I’ll remain to the day with a theory, from here to lake
Erie
You know that the devil’s a liar!
The choir, I sit on my phone, all alone with my baby just singin’ my melody
Raisin’ a son. I never get tired, I’m too rugged for (Ahh, Ooohh)
I couldn’t retire! Another dimension. Releasin’ my tension
They’re payin’ attention, they’re walkin’ so blind. Oracles, snakes…

[Hook - Michael Jackson and Krayzie Bone]
Aaaahhh! (pray, pray, and we pray, pray, pray)
Ooohhh! (and we pray, pray, pray) whoooo!
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we've done! (look what we've done, done, done)
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we’ve done! (lord, what have we done, done, done?)

[Flesh-n-Bone]
Signs keep showin’, goin’ on
Can’t believe how my mind has blown
I witness mostly wickedness
How much more mischief can go wrong?
Steady holdin’ on down to slow it down, tryin’ to make it to a better place
With the enemies up, they stay wide awake and everybody else caught up
In the rat race
Watch how they done trap you. Don’t let ‘em catch you
Wipe away your whole existence
It’s not easy to resist temptation or escape all the resentment. So much
Tension
Seem like I’m havin’ a nightmare that’s reoccurin’. The vision is blurry, the
Curtain is closin’ in a hurry, that’s something worthy of worry
Dig deep and researchers, their story is full of dissention and
Transgression!
Now we gotta find a way to reserve this recession
What have we done? Lord what have we done (done)?
Look what we’ve done! Look what we’ve become!
Lord what have we become? (come)

[Hook - Michael Jackson and Krayzie Bone]
Aaaahhh! (pray, pray, and we pray, pray, pray)
Ooohhh! (and we pray, pray, pray) whoooo!
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we've done! (look what we've done, done, done)
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we’ve done! (lord, what have we done, done, done?)

[Wish Bone]
Richest country in the whole wide world
Then why do got hungry little boys, little girls? (Ahhh Ooohh) spent
In one man lies their dreams. Come clean, just come clean
Mothers, fathers, sons, and daughter, it all adds up to their selfish greed!
They’re greedy, greedy, greedy, greedy, they greedy!
How about one laugh for every lie, twice for the unnecessary lives. But
Since they cowards give ‘em that firing squad, get ‘em outta here quickly
Quickly! Violence must be met with violence, be we be the one’s settin’ off
The riot. Oh no, no, look what we done, done! I’m a voice of power! (power)
I must protect my ghetto son! (baby!)
Without him there’s no blacks tomorrow
We all (Ahh,Oohh), so stop the violence and watch how you change the world (the
Whole wide world)
(I know) it’s clear, won’t get outta there
If you really want change, take a look at the man in the mirror (mirror), in
Your mirror

[Hook - Michael Jackson and Krayzie Bone]
Aaaahhh! (pray, pray, and we pray, pray, pray)
Ooohhh! (and we pray, pray, pray) whoooo!

Look what we've done! (look what we've done, done, done)
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we’ve done! (lord, what have we done, done, done?)

[Layzie Bone]
Ain’t got no apology for the economy
Logically thinkin everybody gotta eat
Blame the economists, all of their promises
Not bein’ honest, why would they lie to me?
I’ma be clea, what I see is fear!
They set up the satellites, labeled us televised!
Population in check, people petrified!
Cnn on deck ‘til they testify
Invadin’ these countries for natural resources
They wipe up the forests to get the oil in the industry, although they
Claim to be loyal
Through all of the turmoil, their families get spoiled
And I mean! 
Heee Heee!
 Can we just go green to kill the pollution?
We need a solution, the future dependin’ on it!
You know what I mean? If you don’t put the endin’ on it
Armageddon gonna come real soon maybe then you want it
Landlords put their tenants on it! U.s
Congress put the senate on it any moment!
I want an atonement without secret service bein’ nervous political warfare
Ghetto came out of nowhere
Let the last be first, it hurt, don’t go there!

[Hook - Michael Jackson and Krayzie Bone]
Aaaahhh! (pray, pray, and we pray, pray, pray)
Ooohhh! (and we pray, pray, pray) whoooo!
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we've done! (look what we've done, done, done)
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we’ve done! (lord, what have we done, done, done?)

[Krayzie Bone]
(ahh, ahh!) so what you gonna do
What you gonna do? (do, heee heee!)
When the new world order come for you. (for you, for you, ahh, ahh!)
So what you gonna do, what you gonna do?
Lord what have we done? (done, done, done)
