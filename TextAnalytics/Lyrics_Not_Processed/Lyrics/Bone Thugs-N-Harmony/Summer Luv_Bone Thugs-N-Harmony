Winter we been on the grind Waiting on the summer time Anxious for the time to shine Show'em how they suppose to rhyme
(Krayzie Verse) We finna hit up the cold big store Put up some dough C'mon you rollin with kray Hey this could be another winderfull dayyy Grandady on in my drop top caddy Groupin on a fattie Swoopin through the alley You can find me Doin it after park Until the po-po come And ruin it after dark Ohhh noo But we gun try our best to keep it crackin Light it up to the break of dawn And just don't stop
(chorus)
I can feel it in the air Can you feel it (Summer love)(yeahh) I can see everywere Can you see it (Summer Love)(yeahh) x2 All winter we been on the grind Waiting on the summer time Anxious for the time to shine Show'em how they suppose to rhyme

(chorus) I can feel it in the air Can you feel it (Summer love)(yeahh) I can see everywere Can you see it (Summer Love)(yeahh) x2 All winter we been on the grind Waiting on the summer time Anxious for the time to shine Show'em how they suppose to rhyme
(Wish Bone Vesre) Motorcycle rollin Him not because they know me Slide through Ride through Then what He don't want it Grab sumthing from the back Snatch off something off from the fat back And girlies girlies luv when I ride that Fast or slow Ima take her were she need to go Hold on tight Its summer time So we ridin all night If it gets too cold we cAN jump in watever Continue enjoying this good good weather
(chorus) I can feel it in the air (Summer love)(yeahh) Can you feel it (Summer Love )(yeahh) I can see everywere (Summer Love)(yeahh) Can you see it (Summer Love)
