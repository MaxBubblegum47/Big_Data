[Hook: Krayzie Bone]
Hard times, got my mind in a bind
I'll go crazy, tryin to climb out the grime
That's in my life, I'm surprised I've survived
It's amazin, I'm alive, I got by with my life

[Layzie Bone]
Every time I look around it seem like I'm in trouble
Pressure by the double, Lord I love you
And I really trust you, wish that I could hug you
Disappear from the grain and the rubble
And I'm tryin to keep from goin under
We ride Eastside, blowin in the wind
Each time I try, they lie, no lie
Judgin from the outside lookin in
Never had a clue of what I really do
The ghetto pushin through but I'ma do it right
Never buckle, never stop to struggle
Layzie got the muscle through the pressure bust pipes
My life, highlights, bright lights, alright
Story of a warrior, my flight
Final destination, thug motivation
Time never wastin, pacin my fight

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Tryin to get it good, feel the hustle and flow
You know we are the mighty soldiers
Had it for the shit we been through
And doin whatever that God truly knows
So here we are steady on the go
It's too late cause we been through crazy
Every day seem to bring a twist
That take us on a loop but we don't let it phase
Raising these babies, do we ever run away
From responsibility but where you goin?
You're gonna have to face the music anyway
Livin through a true reality but you be blowin
If they test you make 'em feel the pressure
Let off some aggression
Yo the Flesh'll really give 'em somethin to stress
More likely even less

My life, lil' nigga bailin through the hood
Lookin crooked like I could
Get you for your goods, make it understood
Put it on the wood - nigga what?
I used to have to grind in the dough
I did a little time in the polk
A couple wicked rhymes that I wrote
Really helped a nigga shine with my folks
Cause nigga I was broke
But Eazy heard us go and Eazy said "Whoa!
Y'all niggas dope, five niggas loc
Five killer flows, y'all fin' to blow"
So temptation made us sign the papers
Overnight sensation clearly chasin Satan
Niggas really famous, got a lot of haters
Callin us the greatest, #1 and can't nobody fade us
Got that top spot, done did it (done did it)
Came back fallin down, down

[Wish Bone]
Bone, what happened?
What happened, why did Eazy die?
What's wrong with Bizzy, he alright?
Is Flesh, really comin home? Is Bizzy comin home?
Wish he'd the Henny to the dooooome
I'm so high, stay fadeeeeeeeeeed...
Might feel a little better but the pain stays there
It's okay the real gotta strive
Everywhere we go the hood life's alike
Cause they can relate to the fight
The real from the fake, sound good he's alive

[Bizzy Bone]
As I wake up early in the mornin, light my cigarette up
Wake up both my bitches, take a shower quickly
Tell my Lord I love him dearly, fight the devil
Get him ahead and swiftly {*swish*}
I never ever thought I'd keep my candles lit up
Get 'em, hit 'em, get 'em, mm-mm I'm with Bizzy
Nobody knows my struggle nor my hustle
I'm a certified rider, gave up all my children
Women in my shit and dippin
Now you know the Lord is always with me, that's my only weapon
Talk to every sinner, bless 'em
Then I raise my 7 up and I don't give a fuck, get 'em
Television celebratin livin, get a ribbon
Every now and then I'm chillin
Nigga this my life and I'ma live it
And give it right back to God, now listen
