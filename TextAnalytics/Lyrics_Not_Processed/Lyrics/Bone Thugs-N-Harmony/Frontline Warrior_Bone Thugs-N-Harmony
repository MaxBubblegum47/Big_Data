[Intro]
Get ready-get ready-get ready-get ready
We the frontline, we the frontline

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
Nigga, thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
Nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
Whoever wanna bring the noise, talkin' 'bout me and my boys
Disrespected on a regular like a nigga got clout
Well it's all about his Mo Thug music
Put my name in your mouth and a nigga gon' do you
Who the fuck them niggas tryna play?
Lay don't stop until you meet my Glock
I'ma get'cha, make your body rott, nigga, make the party pop
Nigga, why not? Time's tickin' on the clock, get the heat locked
I'ma hit the weed spot, joyride with my niggas 'til the beat drop
We got big Benjamins spendin' C-O's
While you playin', we buyin', y'all rentin', pin me
Probably livin' in a tent pocket full of lint
Tryna flip it like I flip it, nigga got me bent
And like I said it on the last song, nigga, we joyriders, and y'all ain't Bone
B-B-O-B the bad boy of the Bone
I'll be thuggin' for eternal, wanna test me? It's on
Now where my niggas at? Get the gat, peel a nigga wig back
Nigga dig that dig that
All original, Cleveland's own criminal, here we go
From a place where a nigga might bury ya
Nigga, act up and I better take care of you, scared of ya?
I be ready for the war
Nigga I'm America's most, bet it, coast to coast
Steady thuggin' out here in these streets
Lookin' out for the rollers, duckin' these haters, they wanna fade us
Well I keep my heat
And it ain't no peace and fuck tha police
Come out the house all eye's on me
Jump in my 5 double 0 B-E-N-Z XL and I hit the freeway

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
Nigga, thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
Nigga, we the frontline warriors

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]

[?] bang with the Glock on Sunday
Never know I might bust on you one day, ohhh
Swiggin' with Jack and the bombay, ooh, bye, bye blow-blow-blow
Yeah, nigga, fuck you, oh hell yeah, fuck you too
Better than God devised, realize you can end up bigger
But my niggas in the middle hopin' they won't starve
The foul sinnin' beginnin' now
And then nobody get they mental together
And they tell the nigga it good to be back from prison
But don't nobody feel him but them niggas around the globe
And the mission was money was gold
Everyone nutty when money because he was out of the gutter
When nothin' but avid souls better make-up to trust
No one will touch me one wait 'til they ruff enough
Got him at last but I just corrupt
I don't even erupt
Creep on ah come up, what up?
Trapped in a rapture, the trumpets pumpin' tellin' us somethin'
Snatch you, we havin' a blast you tattered like cattle
And medallions, diamonds in the gallows
Ghetto rich bastards runnin' much faster than the average asses in the shadows
Out of the battlefield

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
Nigga, thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors

[Bridge: Big B]
Call me a secret weapon
I think the war is on
And when they ask 'em who is he
It's 7th Sign and Bone (It's 7th Sign and Bone)
Call me a secret weapon (Call me a secret weapon)
When the war is on (The war is on)
And when they ask em who is he
It's Big B and Bone (Big B and Bone)
Frontline soldiers

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
Nigga, thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
Nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
Nigga, thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
