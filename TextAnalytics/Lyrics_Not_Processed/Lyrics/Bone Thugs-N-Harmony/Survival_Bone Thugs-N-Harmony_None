[Chorus: Ky-Mani Marley]
Girl, I'll be there when the mornin' comes
'Cause these ends were made for survival (Talk to 'em)
Girl, I will be there when the mornin' comes
'Cause these ends were made for survival

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
There's many levels to my hustle, the struggle won't take me under
They wonder how I survived it, kill it and revive it
Witness a survivor, the mind is strictly the provider
The ambitions of a rider
It's too strong, I gotta make it
But if makin' it mean I gotta fake it, I'd rather stay on my Kray shit
Basement, nigga, we keepin' it real around here
They tried to lock us out of the game so now we're coming from 'round rear

[Verse 2: Flesh-N-Bone]
Gotta hold my head up high while I got ten toes on the pavement
The survivors are so real with one foot in the grave
We just signed a new deal, plenty more money to make
I can eat whatever meal, now I can get my bills paid
I still hold down the block, I still runnin' and duckin' cops Tryna slam me back down but that's not possible
I'm keepin' my eyes on the prize, man, that's how I'm focused
Pedal to the metal, in my own lane, wide open

[Chorus: Ky-Mani Marley]
Girl, I'll be there when the mornin' comes (Huh)
'Cause these ends were made for survival (Talk to 'em)
Girl, I will be there when the mornin' comes
'Cause these ends were made for survival

[Bridge: Ky-Mani Marley]
I won't die, I won't die
I promise I won't die, tonight (Yeah)
I won't die, I won't die
Girl, I promise I won't die, tonight (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Hey, look, I do this for the art of rap
Serious like a heart attack
Focus on the paper I stack 'cause I need a larger pack
Death, see, I can conjure that
Here to bring the honor back
Get respect so kids in the ghetto can one day follow that
I'm runnin' a marathon, niggas is out here racin' me
Ain't no erasin' me, ain't no disgracin' me
Ain't no replacin' me, I do this for tomorrow
But if I die tonight, I die a martyr

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
It's Lil Bizzy, he be still in the zone
When niggas ask me what I'm doin', I proceed to make it known
You don't have to be the coolest, it don't mean you ain't a Bone
I'ma have to be the truest, I'ma leader, leave the throne
Nobody fuckin' with nigga, I be ready and then I be gone (Gone)
And after I'm done, they be headed for warfare
Anywhere that it's on
Have no motherfuckin' fear and I put that on the Lord
I'ma pull out one of my swords
I don't give nobody none of my tears, I live in war

[Refrain: Ky-Mani Marley]
(Girl, I'll be there when the morning comes)
'Cause these ends were made for survival

[Verse 5: Wish Bone]
Give 'em an inch, they want a mile
Show 'em love, they [?] are cowards
That's why me, I'm scopin' like a thousand niggas
Pop now, for tomorrow niggas
Rockabye ain't never say never, gas out
That's on my mental, it's simple
When hustle continue, continue
If you not playin' the real games then step out the way
'Cause 'round here is real things, that's all day
'Cause what I been through, I been through
In my mind, it's no equal
Strategize, minimize, divide the fake from your people

[Outro: Ky-Mani Marley]
I won't die, I won't die
Promise I won't die, tonight
