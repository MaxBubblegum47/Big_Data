[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
She want that thuggish, ruggish, turnt up in the function

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
You know I keep it true to my grave
Girl, I always stay one hundred
Kept it real for twenty years, I ain’t changed
Be careful when you cruisin' in my lane
Watch me creep up through your rear view as I gas right past these lames
We-we-we did it how we did it ‘cause we did it for the money
Livin' howe we livin', this, you really, really love this
You want a thug nigga like me
Yeah, you know they all love niggas like me (Like me, like me)

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
She ain’t complainin' mainly ‘cause it's everything I do that's entertainin'
Hangin', swangin', body bangin', she in trainin' to be famous
Yeah, she speak the language, baby know just where the lane is
She with me, she’d never named with strangers, know we armed and dangerous
This ain’t that there
This still that thug shit but this for them players
This for the ones that’s puttin' the smoke up in the air
Everything one hundred, baby, this is St. Clair

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
She want that thuggish, ruggish, turnt up in the function
Shake it for the love of the money

Everything one hundred
Everything one hundred

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Let's go
She want the thuggish ruggish, 
wanna see me in public
She seen I lost weight and now she wanna see the stomach
Your booboo still love it
Women are here, fuck it
Let’s make it clear, before we dove into the sea, touchin'
I come from broke nothin', I keep the ghetto with me
Because the ghetto’s in me, trill niggas still thuggin'
She in the tail
With me

With me 
scale
With me 
bail
With me 
hail
With me coast if you sail

[Verse 4: Flesh-n-Bone]
We got your lady stuck on a thugster, that's who she want that love from
Them busters don’t know what to do with it, come get a lump some
I tell 'em shut up and listen up to this game
Then rub 'em down, head to toe, then whip 'em up with that thang
I'm known to get down for mine, trollin' this borderline of crime
But I’m doing fine and that’s why I’m they valentine
I do it-do it two times until she scratch me
Now she hittin' licks callin' me papi

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
She want that thuggish, ruggish, turnt up in the function
Shake it for the love of the money
I give her that thug love, I do my stuff
Girl, everything one hundred
(I’ma keep it one hundred)
Everything one hundred
Everything one hundred, yeah
Everything one hundred
Everything one hundred

[Verse 5: Wish Bone]
Car nice, all while, we on the highway
She got her head in my lap, we ridin' dirty
Thuggish ruggish, first of the month, see me shine
Notorious thugs, for the love of money
If I could teach the world to be a thug like me-me
If I could teach the world to be a thug like me-me

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
She want that thuggish, ruggish, turnt up in the function
Shake it for the love of the money
I give her that thug love, I do my stuff
Girl, everything one hundred
(I’ma keep it one hundred)
Everything one hundred
Everything one hundred, yeah
Everything one hundred
Everything one hundred
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
