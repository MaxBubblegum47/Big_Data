[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
My nigga, let's get P.O.D.'ded (P.O.D.'ded, P.O.D.'ded)
(So high, so high am I)
Reefer and blunts is all that's needed (needed, needed)
(So high, so high am I)

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Slow down, make it too smoky for you, baby
Fucked up--look at you faded
I am what I am as a thug in the Land
And that's all that I am
Damn, you better come join this thugsta party
Blunt smoke up in your body
And come get high, get high

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
My nigga, let's get P.O.D.'ded (P.O.D.'ded, P.O.D.'ded)
(So high, so high am I)
Reefer and blunts is all that's needed (needed, needed)
(So high, so high am I)

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Let's all get lifted
Split the swisher, quickly twist us up a fatty
Now, I've been smokin' out all day long
P.O.'d in the back of Krayzie's Caddy
How in the world did I manage to smoke this many?
About a hundred, man. Feel it all in my stomach
To the brain severely blunted
And it ain't no shame off in my game
Hydroponics and Indonesia
Even the stress sometimes be creeper
So pass me some reefer, want to receive, ah
Little Lay, givin' you what you need
Nothin' but the best green leaves
With a pocket full of cheese, gettin' P.O.D

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
My nigga, let's get P.O.D.'ded (P.O.D.'ded, P.O.D.'ded)
(So high, so high am I)
Reefer and blunts is all that's needed (needed, needed)
(So high, so high am I)

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
I be so high, feel high. Forgive me Lord
But I feel like the weed be blessin' my soul
Got to smoke that sticky, smelly stuff
But I just can't get enough
Smoke it, hit it, pass it to the next man
Let him choke, smoke but don't hold on
Don't hold on, on. No, no
And if you smoke it with me, yeah
Then, I'm a smoke it with you
Y'all, we can smoke it all up
We can smoke and get ba-
We can smoke it all up
We can smoke and get ba-, ba-, ba-, ba-, buzzed

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
My nigga, let's get P.O.D.'ded (P.O.D.'ded, P.O.D.'ded)
(So high, so high am I)
Reefer and blunts is all that's needed (needed, needed)
(So high, so high am I)

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone + 
Krayzie Bone
]
P.O.D.'ded that'll get me in my seat
Hennessy and I ain't too young to be that poetically
Here to believe that I get brave, and all on my way
In a daze, me puff puff on my reef
Got a blunt for the thugs and hustlas
Ain't no bustas in the Mo Thug game
And it gets me out of all miseries
Follow the benefits, stay in place
As long as we reach, put up the fist and flip and pray
I'll be done, when I reach my own
Stay free; let the time go pass me by
Stay high, I'm P.O.D.'d. (P.O.D.'d)
I smoke on nothin' but the best of buddah
Ooh, yeah. Get the blunts and weed
Fuck the Hennessy; let's focus on these leaves
Reefer really relax my mind
And ask me one more time
Get a split up, keep it lit up. Can you feel us?
Get with us, smoke with your nigga
Somebody told me, you better
Respect the sticky leaves, sticky leaves, sticky leaves

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
My nigga, let's get P.O.D.'ded (P.O.D.'ded, P.O.D.'ded)
(So high, so high am I)
Reefer and blunts is all that's needed (needed, needed)
(So high, so high am I)
