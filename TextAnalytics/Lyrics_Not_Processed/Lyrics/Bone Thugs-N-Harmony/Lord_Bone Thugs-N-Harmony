[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
I ain't never had shit
Not a pot to piss, window to throw it out of
Sherm got me high, get your ass in the shower
Took one pull, shit, told her it wasn't sour
Hit a double drum chant getting louder
Chant getting louder (Louder)
Mulan bitch wanna fuck for an hour
Start sucking dick, bitch, enough of the powder
Come fuck with this bougie nigga
Come fuck with this bougie nigga
High fashion, Ksubi nigga
You fuck with them booty niggas
'Cause you fuck with them booty niggas
Now Fergie all up in your groupie, nigga
Reincarnation of Master Fard
Elijah Muhammad
 reside in my heart
Diss and I'll blow, 
and shouts from Allah
Knowledge was born with science, young lord
Tripping yourself is no valish, young lord
Study your scriptures and follow your God
Life in the trap I know times will get hard
I'll pick up your life, just abide by the Lord

[Bridge: A$AP Ferg]
Abide by the Lord
Abide by the Lord
Abide by the Lord (Alright!)

[Verse 2: Flesh-N-Bone]
You 'bout to get it from a general, I don't know if they can hear me though
Don’t you niggas ever bother tryna see me, I'm a criminal
Oh Lord, once he's in the sight of a scope
I'ma let them have it when I sever
Damn, he wants to make me set it off
I'ma bury you motherfuckers without a coffin
Never taking no shorts, we never taking no losses
When you're dealing with my crew, A$AP, Bone, yeah, we bosses
Anybody with a bone to pick
Now when I level my charge, I'm damn sure to make it stick
You must be looking to suffer, well I'ma make it quick
Gotta train load of 'ish that’ll make ya sick
I'm here to wipe 'em out quicker than a pandemic
Bone came original, not a gimmick, can you dig it?
Hell yeah they can dig it while I'm sitting on my throne
Steady laughing at you niggas trying to get it 
(Get it, get it)

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Man, I'm runnin 'til the end of this and I don't give a fuck if I was 86'd
A muthafucka play me like I'm Canibus
I'm ready for the battle like I'm takin' Diz
I'm never gonna take it in and nobody can break it in
As-salamu alaykum for the bacon
 and a little bit of coke
I put the cake in and it's certified dope
Having anything to do with it, we selling every rock that they can smoke
So take a toke and I'ma rake it in, Pillsbury the dough
To the dome like I'm seeking through the soul
Like I'm peeking through the soul
But I'm reekin like our reefer, rather keep up with her, go straight to the dro
Creeping on 'em, peeping on 'em, leave 'em in the zone
They don't even really know
Looking on 'em, keeping on 'em, taking every foe
For the love of the money
, I gotta reap in what I sow
But I keep it what I know for the ending of the row, gotta go, will I go?
When I get it I'ma know to follow my known foe
Know Cali and know Coe, my caliber lock and load
Alabaster box
 when I cock and I crow
Got a Glock and I'm Bone Thug, where you wanna flow?
To the clock and the time zone
Spirit gon' fly, all y'all niggas dead to the life force cyclones
Right now when they hydro
What about the well known Cairo?

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone]
Got 'em stuck in the grave
I'm on the grind full time, never rest to get paid
A little hustling mothafucka put the brush to the face
I cut the braids, hit the stage, now they looking amazed
I went from cooking the yay to hundred thousand dollar shows
Got a booking today and I'ma split it with my bros
Gotta get it how we go, come meet me with the pros
No, I'm never gonna fold, watch the bank account grow
If it ain't about dough, then it ain't about jack
And I'ma take it like I want it, I ain't giving it back
I get us in with a stack and then I get on attack
I'm like the Tasmanian Devil
, 
nigga bigger than Shaq
Call the reaper, get the shovel, I'm a certified rebel
In a league of my own and that's a whole nother level
Nothing's free, I never settle, keep the pedal to the metal
When them haters in my rearview, hello, hello

[Verse 5: Krayzie Bone]
Burn! Baby, let it burn, now it's my turn
I get in a nigga's system like a hundred vials of sherm
And then I kill 'em with two thousand words in two minutes
You never heard another nigga spit it like my niggas
Yeah, but you heard 'em try to get it but they couldn’t get it quicker than the realest
Man, they thinking they can deal with this and knock me out my rhythm
But I’m never gonna be the fuckin' victim
'Cause I’d rather be the suspect, haven't I given them enough yet?
Can't they understand they ain't dealing with a punk bitch?
One quick move and it's murder
And I'ma serve a nigga exactly what he deserving
A$AP, but wait a minute
I'm prolly one of the sickest niggas that ever did it, I'm in it 'cause I'ma win it
I'ma mothafuckin' lyrical tyrant, pivotal giant of this shit
And I do way more than just twist the words
You better listen and observe how I rip the verb
Niggas get the nerve to run up on me but my shit's superb
I’ll probably hit a nigga once 'fore he hit the curb
So get at me, I'm kinda trigger happy
When it come to shootin' my gift
, 
I'm like a .44 magnum, stag one
Backin' em up, body bag full of niggas' wack raps
That’s wack so I'm stacking em up
Kray Jack in the cut, still got a little bit of murder for 'em
Murderous poet, I create a bloody murder poem
So when they run up on me, nigga, be ready to show em
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum, rum rum rum rum

[Outro: Bizzy Bone]
Yo, before this project
We’d like to thank the Most High
On behalf of the A$AP Mob, Bone Thug and all in attendance
Knowing that all things belong to those
For the cleanliness and the power, the first in the nation
To prove who they are
Through infinity, through eternity, through time span
Standing, one man, if you hold my hand, hold my hand
(Make sure it's a hand)
With all things around me, I will never win
I won’t win with angels, I won’t win with the brothers
I won’t win with Rome, I won’t win with Sodom and Egypt
(I keep a corpse close to my home)
Let us roll, tell them why we did what we did, if we did
In Jesus name, Amen
