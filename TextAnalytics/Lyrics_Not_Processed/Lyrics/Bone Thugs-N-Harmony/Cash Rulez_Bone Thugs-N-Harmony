[Verse 1: Cassidy]
Yo, to get the cash, I get the mask
My trigger finger itch, so I'm quick to blast
I'm quick to spaz, I'll strip your ass
Let every bullet in the clip hit your ass
Nigga, this Bone and Mr. Cass
Niggas on my dick like, 'you ripped it, Cass'
Niggas never heard me spit this fast
Got niggas on the strip if you hit the glass
(Yo switch it Cass!) I can change the flow
Yo, you the type of cat give my name to po'-po'
You a rat, you a lame with no dough
Push your wig back when I bang the fo'-fo'
I grip it and blast for it
Nigga you can get it if you ask for it
I can spit it in fast forward or I can go in slower
Chop and screw it, have the whole Midwest rockin to it
Have the whole down South snappin' to it
Get the whole East coast back into it, I'm the cat to do it
Whole West coast gon' bang to this
I do this for my niggas with 'caine to pitch
They never should have let me get the hang of this
Now I'ma spit game so dangerous
I'm amazin homes, I raise the chrome
Put the laser on, then blaze the chrome
Better never fuck with Layzie Bone
Can't forget Wish and Krayzie Bone
And best believe that if you fuck with Eve I'm gonna kill you
I rep to the death, F to the S, man it don't get no realer

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rules everything around me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rules everything around me

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Nigga better listen to the warnin', run up on a nigga
He'll die and won't nobody find him 'til the mornin'
Believe me, we ain't scared to put it on ya
Leave you in a field in the Killa Califonia
Nigga make money, get money, big money
'Cause when a motherfucker broke ain't shit funny
You can believe cash rule everything around me
So don't bring yo' broke ass around me
Spitter, nigga wig out, for the scrilla
Killer, dollar billa
In the middle of the drama
I'ma be goin inside yo' pocket for the profit
So drop it, nigga, this Cass' and Bone
Light up some hash and pass the chrome
Any nigga with a misunderstandin' gon' get handled
And that's fo' sho'

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
Nigga, shut it down, we don't fuck around
If a nigga disrespect make him lay down
Used to get it in the street now I'm raised up
Nigga lay face down, nigga give me that shit
What I'm 'posed to do, when the niggas ride through
With his money, I want it
All I'm tryin to say is been doin' this stuff
They fakers don't want it
Hit hard, droppin' bodyguards
You don't want what's over here
Nigga, better watch your broad, cause she'll tell it all
And we'll bring it over there
Nigga this Bone and Cass', who can fuck with that?
If a nigga goes down, ain't nobody gon' rat
We know that, cut 'em all in the face
Whole camp on hush, that's always

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rules everything around me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rules everything around me

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone]
Better give me my money, mayne, I ain't runnin' game
Me and Lil Cass' like one in the same
We want it, we need it, you better believe it
And if you ain't got it we gunnin', mayne
I ain't askin' twice, I never been that nice
No niggas been killed for a game of dice
He come short on the debt and he paid the price
Stayin' at home with a safety light
But you chose to gamble, Mr. Rambo
Nigga like that get made example
I'ma tell you like a Biggie sample
Come short on the dough get your contract canceled
I'm up out first with pleny of ammo
This Full Surface clique hard to handle
Nigga run up bet he get dismantled
Got him glued to the tube, can't change the channel

[Verse 5: Eve]
I was born to be a rich bitch
Can't ever block me from this dough
Nigga, ridiculous
Yeah you see me, 
Hermes head to toe
You want to witness, you can't stop me, pop on the jet
Headed to Paris for a hour just to cop me a dress
You call it crazy, well I call it life
And I'm makin sure I'm all good
Nigga it's hard to rich, fuck broke
I remember that bein' in the hood
And I ain't never goin back, fuck that
Got too much in life I want and need
Yeah, you haters we love it and love it
Cassidy, Bone and Eve, yeah!

[Chorus: Layzie Bone, Eve & Cassidy]
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rules everything around me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rules everything around me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rules everything around me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rules everything around me
