[Intro: Krayzie] + (Layzie)
Yeah (yeah, Bone Thugs)
You know a nigga been all over the world man (Australia, China, Africa)
It's the same ol' shit everywhere I go y'know (England)

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]
Why does everybody's story seem to sound the same?
It all seems so familiar familiar
Struggle in the game - it all seems so familiar familiar
They left the hood for change - it all seems so familiar familiar
Why does everybody's story seem to sound the same?
It all seems so familiar familiar
They done some time in vain - it all seems so familiar familiar
Gotta wise the shit to lames - it all seems so familiar familiar

[Krayzie Bone]
I can remember that little nigga when he was just a young lad
Nobody thought he would make it up outta the hood before the gun blast
(Gun blast) Cause Johnny wanted to be a thug
Runnin from cops out on the block, the boy was hot and didn't give a fuck
(Scandalous) Runnin up in that black mask
Niggas if you got cash, drop it off in that bag and make craps fast (c'mon)
Destroyin the system, make some money to survive the streets
But you know deep inside that this ain't how you tryin to be
But it's all to think when you're strugglin and can't sleep
Cause you're hungry but can't eat, cause livin just ain't free; but shit
Poppa been laid off (laid off) momma been laid off
Everywhere I hear the same old song

[Hook]

[Layzie Bone]
To probably take a loss, I'm tryin to fight these demons
By any means, by any cost I'm out here reppin Cleveland
They got me bobbin weavin, nigga give me the reason
To let 'em flies do or die, niggas no longer breathin
Known as a heathen, before Layzie Bone it was Steven
And I'm just tryna break even, leavin you leakers steadily creepin
Shit get deep when daddy gone (daddy gone)
And momma can't do it on her own (her own)
Lights off, gas gone, "Momma, daddy comin home?"
I guess not, sell rocks, rappin with my niggas Bone
(Whassup Wish? Yeah, we all we got!) And that's Bone Bone Bone Bone
(Whassup Kray? Yeah, we all we got nigga!) And that's Bone Bone Bone Bone

[Hook]

[Wish Bone]
So you been to the Chi? Me too; you ever been shot? Me too
Sold rocks, all-nighters on blocks, catch cases? Shit, me too
That's the story, no one write it, nobody can tell it for me
Momma workin double shift - daddy who, daddy who?
And when he do it's always later, never came
Now look, he done broke that boy's heart; man again, damn again
Don't wonder why it's like that in the ghetto
Grew up, outta luck, don't give a fuck about life, so we let 'em go
I know my heart is cold, you know how them ghetto children grow
Give me the money, and I can keep my temper low
Everybody knows love, clubs, cars and hoes
Priorities fucked up, but we already know!

[Hook] - 2X
