[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
I say, the war shouldn't stop until these player-hatin' niggas' body rot, body rot, body rot
Nigga, the war shouldn't stop until these motherfuckin' cops' body rot, body rot, body rot
I say, the war shouldn't stop until these player-hatin' niggas' body rot, body rot, body rot
Nigga, the war shouldn't stop until these motherfuckin' cops' body rot, body rot, body rot

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
We paper-chase and smoke blunts
You'll nevers find a thuggish bunch of niggas like us (Like us)
Don't be so quick to test us, I'll be 'noyed and might bust
I'mma have to talk to Eazy through the Ouija, so I can see
And maybe he can tell me why you're hatin' on me, bitin' on me
Why you want me to show a nigga' Leatherface in me?
Don't fuck around, nigga, he's a real buck-'em-down
Nigga, motherfuck rappin', how 'bout fuckin' with me now, nigga?
Niggas get ya checks from ya broads, get high
Then your broads sneak ya keys from ya niggas and ride
Everybody wanna party, even the niggas with a problem
Hey, nigga, we can solve 'em, 'cause, bitch, we'll squash 'em
Don't know me, fuck you when you got beef
But you also got the clone styles and all Mo T
See me rappin' on yo TV, actin'
And it's a fact that when you see us in person
Think we gon' flex or show you no action
Down for mine, got to show a nigga time to time
So I figure I'll slow down the rhyme
So they can understand I'm filled with so much anger and pain
And if I drop, then I'll explode like a fuckin' grenade, nigga
Fuck calm, time to ring the alarm
Breakin' niggas out of prison, killin' all the guards (Woo)
Power to the people, givin' people the power to put it down in your city
And fuck them hillbillies
Nigga, I can't stand no motherfuckin' po-po
When will we start killin' these bitches and takin' no mo'? (Yeah)
Mo Thug the only clique that I claim
Although we all beyond the bangin', you can say I roll wit' a gang
And dissin' chin checkers in the makin', uh
So, nigga, continue with the rotation (Rotation, rotation, rotation)

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
I say, the war shouldn't stop until these player-hatin' niggas' body rot, body rot, body rot
Nigga, the war shouldn't stop until these motherfuckin' cops' body rot, body rot, body rot
I say, the war shouldn't stop until these player-hatin' niggas' body rot, body rot, body rot
Nigga, the war shouldn't stop until these motherfuckin' cops' body rot, body rot, body rot

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
I heard a murder
Heard a murder
Heard (Heard)
Yeah, nigga, we heard about all of the murders
Look what they did to Tyrone
Flippin' the flow then let it burn
What if the pistols and police stay strong for the Bone
Bitch, you fuckin' with all of the black cat feet
And in 1999 when ya meet up in Egypt
Bet it be no peace, we release the beast
Settle with the streets and get all my peeps
Get 'em and at least we don't take defeat
Bitch, never retreatâ€”nigga, lose your arms?
Better use your feet
Pick up my Henny-Henn, nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get up off the rock
We're corrupt as a four dollar buck
Come and get fucked up
And get out the county, nigga, get rowdy take out a bounty
Disappear-pear, in an alley, reappear-pear, off in Cali
And you feel me, daddy? Proudly, I done stalk like a mad man
And went through shit in Cleveland with the band
Now look at me platinum, fuck the rap and tour
The bitch made Haitian nation nowadays an occupation
So why you hate me? Still can't fade me away
Go on, be gone, and the point of view was made with the song
And murder they prophets in spots, spots, spots

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
I say, the war shouldn't stop until these player-hatin' niggas' body rot, body rot, body rot
Nigga, the war shouldn't stop until these motherfuckin' cops' body rot, body rot, body rot
I say, the war shouldn't stop until these player-hatin' niggas' body rot, body rot, body rot
Nigga, the war shouldn't stop until these motherfuckin' cops' body rot, body rot, body rot

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
How do you see me when you see me?
Drinkin' on Hennessy and Remy
Look into my eyes, my shit is dreamy
Beggin' to Scotty, "Won't you beam me up?"
I buck, 12 gauge erupt, disrupt your order, infantry
Ya'll better expect annihilation fuckin' around with the SCT
And I better be a soldier organizer up on the love and just us
Army see, full of harmony, and nigga 'In Thugs We Trust'
So nigga I bust, so back up off me, givin' no mercy, shit is critical
Killin' you individual with a Ouija type ritual
I'm diggin' a ditch for all you po-po who felt you could come & raid
Nigga, ain't no way to be safe
Nigga, this the army brigade
So listen up and hear what's spoken as I start this locomotion
Retaliate because we chosen
Open showin' his Lord his devotion

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
I say, the war shouldn't stop until these player-hatin' niggas' body rot, body rot, body rot
Nigga, the war shouldn't stop until these motherfuckin' cops' body rot, body rot, body rot
I say, the war shouldn't stop until these player-hatin' niggas' body rot, body rot, body rot
Nigga, the war shouldn't stop until these motherfuckin' cops' body rot, body rot, body rot

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
Now when you're fuckin' with me
Make sure you know what you're doin'
Got niggas knowin' that they rollin' with me
Infrared to yo' head, don't beg, you dead, we fled
Gotta get away
Gotta make sure I'm free so when you need me I can buck another day
It's a Bone thing, better ride ride
'Cause when you fuckin' wit, you gon' die die
Don't be surprised, Bone want yo presidents, wanna run it all
Run all of it (All of it)
Fuck that dumb, fuck that dumb
Us niggas is super skilled
Nigga, don't pull no gun if you ain't gon' spit
Click-clack-clack be the sound
These police and haters is wrong, uh
We buckin' 'em down
Trust in me and harmony, I find peace
Eternally bless my soul, Lord
And everybody that rides with me
It's from me to you
It's from me to you (Me to you)
It's just my point of view
It's just our point of view (Point of view, point of view), yeah
And that's why I stay high
So high, so high like ladi-da-da-da
Ladi-da-da-da
So high, so high

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
I say, the war shouldn't stop until these player-hatin' niggas' body rot, body rot, body rot
Nigga, the war shouldn't stop until these motherfuckin' cops' body rot, body rot, body rot
I say, the war shouldn't stop until these player-hatin' niggas' body rot, body rot, body rot
Nigga, the war shouldn't stop until these motherfuckin' cops' body rot, body rot, body rot
