[Intro]
1999
The world is at its end, fuck it
We want the money and the power
And go out with a bang

[Chorus: Cold 187um & Kokane]
It's the end of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
So I take my nine, put it on my set, bust a cop in his head
Now I'm blastin'
'Cause I'm known as a G
And I'm comin' from the C-P-T
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas runnin' packs can't fuck with Eazy
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
This is a real life jack in progress
Nigga, give up your shit or take two to the chest with the cripness
'Cause I ain't fuckin' around, G
So take a look at a real live nigga that's crazy
And get ready to die, loc
Any last words before your ass gets smoked?
It ain't a joke
Because my pockets is broke, my friend
That's why I gotta do you in
Give up your ends and your gold and your brand new Nikes
And anything else I might like
And then I'm off in the wind again
To catch the next sucker slippin', takin' two to the chin
I'm on a roll, two niggas in one night
Didn't even have to fight
Just pulled out my 9 to end another's life
That's real life so forget the silly shit you heard
Now, nigga, tell me, do you have any last words?

[Chorus: Cold 187um & Kokane]
'Cause it's the end of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
So I take my nine, put it on my set, bust a cop in his head
Now I'm blastin'
'Cause I'm known as a G
And I'm comin' from the C-P-T
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas runnin' packs can't fuck with Eazy
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Another murder I committed made front page
A nigga dead from a drive-by, did him with a 12 gauge
The first stage of insanity
People say it ain't wise to get faded off the St. Ides
A mother cries, another son lies in a casket
Life was fun while it lasted
That silly bastard had to get caught slippin' and set trippin'
You should have seen that niggas blood drippin'
Too many lives took, too many hearts broke
But you don't hear me, you just see my fuckin' gun smoke
Some ask why do I take so many lives from the innocent little ones
But where I come from we take shit real
You peel caps so you get your fuckin' cap peeled
Grab your steel, forget about what you heard
It's do or die, nigga
Any last words?

[Chorus: Cold 187um & Kokane]
'Cause it's the end of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
So I take my nine, put it on my set, bust a cop in his head
Now I'm blastin'
'Cause I'm known as a G
And I'm comin' from the C-P-T
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas can't fuck with the Eazy
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
I got the 9 and I'm finna straight creep
Feel I need to take another's life, so I peep
Checkin' the scene but stayin' low so I'm not seen
'Case I gotta get away, gotta make the shit clean, G
So I'm lookin' for a victim
Gotta be right, took my time and I picked 'em
Scoped shit, then I licked him
Now I'm back in the news, no clues but yet another murder
You should have heard the nigga squeal when I stuck his ass
I had to grin 'cause it's funny, nigga, fuck his ass
He ain't the last and surely ain't the first, G
But his monkey ass rolled away in a hearse, G
So I'm feelin' somewhat relieved
Just another day in the life of the Eazy
A real G, so forget the silly shit you heard
It's do or die, Eazy-E gets that last word

[Chorus: Cold 187um & Kokane]
'Cause it's the end of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
So I take my nine, put it on my set, bust a cop in his head
Now I'm blastin'
'Cause I'm known as a G
And I'm comin' from the C-P-T
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas runnin' packs can't fuck with Eazy
'Cause it's the end of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
So I take my nine, put it on my set, bust a cop in his head
Now I'm blastin'
'Cause I'm known as a G
And I'm comin' from the C-P-T
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas runnin' packs can't fuck with Eazy
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up (Can't fuck with Eazy)
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up (You should know, bitch ass niggas runnin' packs can't fuck with Eazy)
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up (Can't fuck with the Eazy)
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up (It's the end of the world)
(Can't fuck with Eazy)
