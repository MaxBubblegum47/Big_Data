[Verse 1: The 87's]
In the backseat of a chevy 64
Roof chopped off, sitting on some 24's
Out in LA, blowing chronic out the door
Drinking coke and Hennessy
Got my crew in like I'm Pablo Escobar
And we're cruising down Venice Boulevard
Out in LA, blowing chronic out the car
Drinkin coke & Hennessy

[Pre-Chorus: The 87's]
Got my hand out the window
Regulate Warren G on the radio
It's a good day 'cause I got my friends and the indo
And my Coke and Hennessy

[Chorus]
Yeah, Coke and Hennessy, baby
Coke and Hennessy, baby
Coke and Hennessy, baby
You know how we do it
Yeah, Coke and Hennessy, baby
Coke and Hennessy, baby
Coke and Hennessy, baby
You know how we do it

[Verse 2: The 87's]
Hit the drive through on the way down to the beach
Come and slide through, 'cause it's where you wanna be
Out in LA, like we're back in '93
Drinking Coke and Hennessy

[Pre-Chorus: The 87's]
Got my hand out the window
Regulate Warren G on the radio
It's a good day 'cause I got my friends and the indo
And my Coke and Hennessy

[Chorus]
Yeah, Coke and Hennessy, baby
Coke and Hennessy, baby
Coke and Hennessy, baby
You know how we do it
Yeah, Coke and Hennessy, baby
Coke and Hennessy, baby
Coke and Hennessy, baby
You know how we do it

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone & 
Bizzy Bone

Now we rollin', blowin', chokin'
While my niggas steady smokin'
Pourin' Coke and Hennessy (We on some high shit)
We just zonin mind our own and
No we don't know where we goin'
We just rollin' down the street
I remember it like it was yesterday
And it probably was
Me and my niggas are over
A couple of Crips and a couple of blunts
And I figure when this gon' happen
Is somebody could get fucked up
Little Eazy 6 - 4 bounce
I carry the ounces, I carry the ounces
Yeah, pour me some Hen' in y cup, but minus the Coke
Nigga turn up
(Oh, LA where the women and the weather is amazin')
Niggas ain't givin' a fuck
Rollin the dough, give me some love
(OG's with the primest OG so we're blazin')
LA, now we breezy like
(Yeah, Coke and Hennessy, baby)
(Coke and Hennessy, baby)
Filled up a cup and light night
(Coke and Hennessy, baby)
(You know how we do it)

[Chorus]
Yeah, Coke and Hennessy, baby
Coke and Hennessy, baby
Coke and Hennessy, baby
You know how we do it

[Outro]
You know, you know, you know what I'm sippin'
You know, you know, you know what I'm sippin' on
You know, you know, you know that I'm sippin' on
Coke and Hennessy, yeah baby
