Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely nothin', nothin', nothin'...

War, war, war, war, war...
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothin, nothin', nothin', nothin...

[Layzie]
We be the mighty mighty warriors [warriors]
On the rise [on the rise]
Thug (censored) to my battle cries
Warriors [warriors] on the rise [on the rise]
[Time to die.] Thug (censored) [Time to die.]
You better be ready for war. It's almost here--nineteen ninety-nine
Could it be the endin', new millenium?
Sendin' them soldiers out to die, then they ride for the cause
Screamin' (censored) we muggin', givin' no lovin' to these fake-ass laws
Mo Thuggin'. If you need to be prepared
Pump your strap up in the air
Let em' all loose if you ain't scared
Shoot 'em up, if ya don't care. Yeah!
And I go to war for two thangs: challenge me
I want my (censored) cheese, my (censored) family
Understand me: I ain't tryin' to tell you war ain't the lick
But in the streets, you need your heat
Or get your wig split
Strategize, mental mind, and timin' it perfect on the attack
Throw distraction in the front
Come with the dumpin' from the back. Yeah!

War, war, war, war, war...
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothin, nothin', nothin', nothin...

One, two, three, four...
Ride, ride, ride, ride
We're ready to pull out and ride, ride, ride, ride...
Ready . . . You're dead

[Flesh]
I'm comin' to test you (censored) fate
See how many of y'all are prepared for Armageddon
Should it be Judgement Day, still it's a big mistake
How many have been face to face with death before?
Tell me, how does it feel? Real nervous?
'Cause everybody's ready to kill if it's my will
Safe outta my battle
Quit lookin' or I might have to smoke you
When I roast you with this beam
Focus you through my scope, mo murdered
Mighty, mighty warriors
Some of the mighty, mighty trues still on the rise
If you wanna test, you die
Then, I might make the news
We stompin' in steel-toed boots and suited up in fatigues
Killin' a few (censored), army throw up the white flag and retreat
So many soldiers, so many stories of war
But what is it good for?
Nobody knows, and what if the world is over in two triple zero?

War, war, war, war, war...
What is it good for? Absolutely nothin, nothin', nothin', nothin...

[Wish]
If thangs don't change, I think we all gon' die
Who's to say they wrong or right?
You pushin' the button, not I, but we die
That's why I'm gatherin' up my soldiers [soldiers]
Mo Thug, mine are prepared for war
Because it's over [over]
Red light, red light, red light, ride or die
It's gon' be casualties. So be ready to ride
And say it again: there's gon' be casualties
So be ready to ride. And I got your back [back, back, back]
If it goes like that [that, that, that]
Mo Thug ready to ride, if it goes like that
And we all get papped, papped, papped. Yeah, yeah

War, war, war, war, war...
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothin, nothin', nothin', nothin...
