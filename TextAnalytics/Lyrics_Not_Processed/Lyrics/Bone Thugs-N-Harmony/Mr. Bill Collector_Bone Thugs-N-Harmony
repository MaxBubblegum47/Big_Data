[Hook/ Krayzie & Layzie]
Them callin' me Mr. Bill Collector
Needin' me money, no ease up tonight
(See niggas can't stand us, so they label us scandalous)
And if them runnin' off with me cash
That ass gonna have to pay the price
(Meet a muthafuckin' po-po; gotta hit 'em with the fo'-fo')

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Don't be fuckin' with my money, nigga no
See when Krayzie pull the pump, then I kill 'em all
Pump slugs, when blood hit the wall, watch 'em fall
Now dog who ya gonna call?
Puttin' niggas in the coffin where they probably better off
And Leatherface is not a punk bitch so a nigga just can't fuck me
Nigga better have me cash
Or I kill his whole family when the twelve gauge pump blast
Now test me
Never ever let a nigga ride when he think he fin to slide
Pop him in the spine, get him for the money
Nigga tried to play me and dash
And that's why me thugs just put slugs in that ass, fatally
And me never want to see no
Oh jealous muthafucka tried to keep a nigga ends low
If he scared to smoke a primo
Gotta go with the fiends and in the click is a no no
Gotta make that money man
Gimme all my change, it's a murder thang, now
Even in the dummy game
Niggas comin' up slain for collectin' they claim
Now, Leatherface, me pick up me gauge
Leather mask and nigga, me blast
So ya better respect us, when you see the bill collector
Rippin' killin' niggas for that mad money thang

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Niggas steady payin' them dues, runnin' with trues
Nothin' to lose, everything to prove
Little thug from the C-Town, never caught sleepin'
Always on the come up creepin'
Runnin' this shit now puttin' that Bone down
Gotta let a nigga know for the love of cheese
Movin' thangs in the nine-five, rollin' with
Ruthless, thuggin' with my niggas from the Clair
And we smokin' them green leaves, fuck with me now
Oh nigga don't test rest, straight Leatherface in the place
On a mission don't be messin' with my bankroll
Niggas wanna gank on Bone, so I stank them prank hoes
And I bet he know me takin' no more losses
Put 'em in a coffin, and they life is better off
And these niggas they don't know me they can't know me
Thought you had a homie, but ya fuckin' with the muthafuckin' Boss and
Nigga gotta get me mine on the nine-nine
In the nine-five, bodies dropping
When you hear my pistol select ah dome
Respect that True how's the underground shit
Mr. Bill Collector, Bone

[Hook/ Krayzie & Layzie]
Them callin' me Mr. Bill Collector

[Verse 3:Wish Bone]
Nigga take it off thank ya please don't make me stank ya
Time to pay the bill, write your checks up all night
Catch a slug or chill, bill collectors better respect 'em
Mo Thug, sellin' drugs, pumpin' slugs all up in that rectum check 'em
Click-click, fall to the ground when the Glock pop nigga chest pump blood
And takin' too long, better drop it on down or ya catchin' two to the head
Shoulda gave 'em up bitch to the Mo Thug lunatic quick to pop, now you dead dead
Gotta pull that nine on the niggas everytime
Sellin' rocks on the nine-nine
Gotta put him on the pave
If ya want to die, put 'em in the grave better give me all them dimes

[Bridge: Krayzie & Layzie]
I didn't want to take his life
But the nigga tried to run and get away with me yayo
(Now you see me, the murderer.)
4x

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
Sawed-off pumpin', dumpin' steadily all the way to the other side we ride
Sherm, when I hit that corner now, niggas is 'bout to die
Thugsta theivin' off in Cleveland and I couldn't sell out my ci-ty
Murder now to come up, move Bone'll be bringin' that city, wit me pin me
Nigga, this the team, by the way, don't fuck with brains
Put in my mind all off on my murder murder y'all all, and I flees the scene
Clean, and I'm out to fade 'em, hey, and I'm out for money, gauged 'em
Better pray to save 'em, but it won't do any good, now bang bang Caution I lossin' me brain get 'em up off the 'cane, bang
Kill a nigga, bang pull a trigger, bang
Comin' up out to wet 'em, man
Off with the blood, put 'em in the mud with a slug thug gotta get paid
Reachin' on back as we bail to pick up me shells
No slippin' the buck and the gauge spray
Sawed-off on the block cocked, ready to pop ya, now cause broke gets played
This dope get paid and nigga, come drop it down
