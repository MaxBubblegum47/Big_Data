Krayzie:
I've been tryin ta gather my niggas from battle
We outta control we can't be handled
We sick of police and these scandals
44. Magnums bust'en at random at em
In the Middle of the Chaos
Tell'em we bust'en our shit at the mayor
If he get caught up there's nothing ta save ya
Gauge a spray ya break ya down to were
In front of the parkin lot
I'm murderin niggas that point to shoot it
If it ain't black owned than we loot it
Burn this bitch down, lets do it
We ain't marchin' we ain't talkin'
We keepin' an eye on the target
So as soon as the shit get started
We gone poppop papop that riot
Pumpin that Violence-ee (Violence)
POPO don't want peace
They want this robot in the streets with me and my T.H.U.G's
BITCH you freeze
You under arrest and you got the right to die
And guess who's pullin the switch
And I can't wait ta see ya fry
Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog

Layzie:
I never did have no love for the system man
Them laws ain't built to protect me
I'm just a nigga tryin ta live the american dream
When you wanna arrest me
And for WHAT
BeCause I'm shinning Blinging
Mad because I'm rhyming Singing
Got too much money Got too many guns
Yo pitiful life ain't got no meaning
And I know you Scheming
LIL Burna done got legit now
Bitch you sit on the ground you get on the ground
You ain't talking that shit now
Wanna spit rounds we can go there
Capo bring that regime and handle it
Capo just strapped wit Tec's and nine's
For busten in the sky gotta grenade launcher
Ain't nothing to do today
So what i'm a do im a bust on tha cops
Shoot tha street lights out on the block dial 911 sit back and watch
I can hear them sirens comin
I'm a teach these fools not to fuck with me
And The outcome was a catastrophe
Do this once a week till my brothers free
Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog

Bizzy:
United we stand divided we fall
For the same bullshit like snipers on Whitehouse lawn's
On that goodshit
Niggas from Compton to Africa
On that thug shit
Reginold Deney No Comment
I lost my blood with the death of Carlos Davis Lord
I can't love shit
Thats the fullest extent thats giving
I'm above this deception I know they intentions
With sworrrds made by Smith N Wesson
Pullin me weapon embracin me Lorrrd
Feel the spirtual ressurection through my porrres
When the souls of the Outlaws at war
No College Scholarships jus' Calibers and Clips
On the Blockwarrior plottin on Kingpin Licks
Flip Burgers I jus' can't see it
I'm a face mo c.r.e.a.m. with BONE THUGS in one night
No Secret
Fuck The Feds it ain't no love at all for me
They pull me over with Police Dogs
Lickin my Scrotum
Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog
Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog
Wish:
See Young Thug could tell me nothing
Ya Fuck up I Shed blood
Gotta leave this world with somethan
A realer nigga with more than I can handle
The Drugs was at so thats were a mack Got caught up in a scandal
Police ain't right and we ain't neither
Everybody want something equal
Listen up my people
We gotta down get down for, right Now!
Nigga fuck yo people
And this is how we all (all) dream to get paid (paid)
Got us thinkin he's one of a kind he's better than everybody destroyin dreams
But don't you listen we can rise above it above it
Nine times outta ten don't fuck that
Cause they gon love it
Quit fuckin with my people
Wonder why

These strong need to be left alone
Yeaa
And thats a fact
