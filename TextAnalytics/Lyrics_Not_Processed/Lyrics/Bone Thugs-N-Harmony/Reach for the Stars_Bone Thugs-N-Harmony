[Intro: Layzie Bone]
(Twinkle, twinkle)
(Twinkle, twinkle)

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Might as well reach for the stars
Way up in the air where you belong
Might as well reach for the stars
Even if you don't make it, you'll still be with the great ones, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
(Yeah)
My path, been clear
The bottom, been there
My plate, gon' share
My grind, took years
I've faced, my fears
I've passed, my peers
I've switched, them gears
They in, the rear
Goin' hard, there no stoppin' him
Everyday gotta thank God again
Money really ain't no problem
Nigga talk crazy, gon' ride on him
Niggas turn they back
Then they wanna be on your side again
Nigga keep it G like alphabet
We ain't tryna be on the ground

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Better go for the gusto
Way up on the rack, my muscle
I'm a get mine's, it's always been cutthroat
Ten toes to the ground, I must blow
On my way up, but I do this for us though
Whatever you set your mind to you can do that, do that
On the ground, full-time I shine cause I'm puttin' in work nigga true that, true that
Ain't it funny how the world go round
Ain't nothin' new to me under the sun
If I did it, Wiz did it, Kray did it, player
Put it up on Bone you can get ya some
Just take that "can't" up outta your vocab
You so bad
Tell the world that you can, can
Little man, man
You gon' land

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Might as well reach for the stars
Way up in the air where you belong
Might as well reach for the stars
Even if you don't make it, you'll still be with the great ones, yeah
Might as well reach for the stars
Way up in the air where you belong
Might as well reach for the stars
Even if you don't make it, you'll still be with the great ones, yeah

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Reach for the stars
Why not go Mars?
We go way too hard
Ya’ll niggas still in cars
No limit the galaxy ours
Shaking these suckas like gravity
To the bottom they constantly grabbin' me
Let ‘em know, straight face
Ya’ll niggas can’t fuck with Kray
But I’m on the brand new wave
And I know that these niggas beneath me
Keep 'em beneath me mane
Keepin’ the heat, niggas is creepin, I gotta keep the thang
They don’t wanna see me shine but the nigga’s so sick with the grind
And they don’t wanna see Kray high, so high, I’m scraping the sky

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
This that thuggish, ruggish, bone
Just like I keep my gun on me, I keep my hustle on
I know that I worked the night wrong
But I been a better been a better been a better a song
Tell a nigga take a better cut and I be gone
Currency
I finna reach for the stars, but don't you hurry me
Currently
The future of this music starts to worry me
That's all ya'll, all ya'll, all ya'll
Cannabis Sativa
And Wiz Khalifa yah

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Might as well reach for the stars
Way up in the air where you belong
Might as well reach for the stars
Even if you don't make it, you'll still be with the great ones, yeah
Might as well reach for the stars
Way up in the air where you belong
Might as well reach for the stars
Even if you don't make it, you'll still be with the great ones, yeah

[Verse 5: Flesh-N-Bone]
Tell me how far is that you see
I'm in another galaxy
Fuck Scotty I'mma beam you up then back down, check this reality
So that give 'em a full dose of ambition, that's ammunition
That click and that clack don't stop it's that drug I'm cookin' in the kitchen
How many pounds a day?
Maybe get few keys of yay
Ya'll heard but they sound like they say
Ya'll fuck around, they don't play
Everyday, it's a special occasion
Everyday, it's a celebration
Everyday, a brand new creation
Everyday, got a brand new hater

[Verse 6: Wish Bone]
Rewind, rewind
You can get the state of mind
And then never give in to it
Speak into existence
Put more weight on the best life, live relentless, (relentless)!
Do the most, do the most
And if I'm close, I never think lose
Never think lose
Not this dude
And if it comes 'round to it, do it
Stand in my way, and I'm a show how we do it, do it
Thugs us no play, no conscience leave 'em all clueless
I do this, do this. Go against the goal. Need I say? That's foolish
Over dose out on the rope
Better than me then prove it
