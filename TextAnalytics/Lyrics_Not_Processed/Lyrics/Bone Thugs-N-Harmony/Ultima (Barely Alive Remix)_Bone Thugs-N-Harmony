[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that

[Verse: Krayzie Bone]
These niggas really don't know grindin'
These niggas really don't know what time it is
I'm finna learn the slackers a lil' lesson
So tell them that my class is in session
So line 'em in
Shady game so sheisty, style so crazy
Niggas don't like me just because I speak the truth
But they don't really want me raisin' the youth
They'd rather see 'em eat garbage (Garbage)

[Bridge: Krayzie Bone]
In life, I'm not forty years old, I'm forty years strong in this shit
I'm movin' like a grown ass man
Leave 'em down with a long ass hand to keep 'em back
Never let lames get too close to me
Sucka friend, this how it's supposed to be
Illuminati won't be moldin' me 'cause I expose the bullshit
Fuck that (Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that)

[Break: Krayzie Bone]
Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that
Fuck-fuck that, fuck-fuck that, fuck-fuck that, fuck-fuck that, fuck-fuck that, fuck-fuck that, fuck-fuck that, fuck-fuck that, fuck-fuck that, fuck-fuck that, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Class is in session so fuck that, fuck that
