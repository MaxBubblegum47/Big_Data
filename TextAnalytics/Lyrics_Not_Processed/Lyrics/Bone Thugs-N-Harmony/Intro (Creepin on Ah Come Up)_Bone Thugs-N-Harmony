[Intro]
(Demon rambling)
(Laughing)
I'm back
Straight off the motherfucking streets of Cleveland
Five true thugs from the Double Glock
Bizzy, Wish, Krayzie, Layzie and that nigga Flesh
Ain't taking taking no shit in the 94
About to shut this bitch down (laughing)
Kick that shit niggas

[Chorus]
East 99 is where you'll find us slanging that yayo, baby
Cleveland is the city where we come from so run run
East 99 is where you'll find us slanging that yayo, baby
Cleveland is the city where we come from so run run
East 99 is where you'll find us slanging that yayo, baby
Cleveland is the city where we come from so run run
East 99 is where you'll find us slanging that yayo, baby
Cleveland is the city where we come from so run run

[Outro]
Now let's rock through the doors backwards my folks... and play with the ouija board (laughing)
