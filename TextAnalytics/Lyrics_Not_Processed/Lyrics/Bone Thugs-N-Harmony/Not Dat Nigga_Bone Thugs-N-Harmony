[Hook: Krayzie Bone]
Ya I got a couple a cribs or what nigga
Rollin' and sittin' on dub dubs nigga
But I don't have to wear no diamonds to shine
Don't need none of dat cause I'm Bone, Bone

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
Look at me tipsy sippin' on some bay goose
Finna let loose cause I can
Fuckin' wit people off the grind nigga you know me I'm the man
Cleveland is the city where the thugs that get down
Just come to my town and ask around they tell you who the rawest in town
Cause I'm a thug by nature
Strictly fo' the paper
Ain't nobody steppin' to Steve
I come wit the ones I come wit the guns
I come wit the rangs that go bang
It's still an everyday thang
To let my nuts hang
You wanna performance wit dat ticket
If the price we can kick it
Like lick imma hit
Party on I gots to get it
Keep the foxy women backin' it up (backin' it up)
While them hatas keep on actin' up
You flashin' what? I'm flashin' flossy nuts
Girl if you comin' take a ride wit me
And if you ridin' wit me sit back recline in yo seat
Cause in the world where I'm from the sun always shine
And even a nigga don't want it baby the world is mine
So come on

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
I'm out of my mind with a ski mask chains and gloves
Waitin' for niggas to come out of the clubs (I hit'em up)
Give me the dubs for my niggas that bang and slang drugs
You fuckin' them niggas up
Ain't no love for Bone Thugs
Nigga fuck y'all you bitches used us
It's splitin' as usual
I ain't takin' no shit from none of y'all
Don't wanna see none of my niggas with no money huh
Since a nigga young you think you dealin' with dummies
Oh you a son of a that's why I split yo bitch
Flipin' that activist for freedom
And my Bone Thug to make a medum no podium
Just fist full nails to leave qiukly youngest Bone nigga 7 sign (7 Sign)
Past that crime y'all get with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
We steppin' inside the party marty gratis
Now get me a shot of Bacardi let it get up in my body
Make my body body rock
I'm lookin' at rappers so full of shit
Imma just get up against the wall dog and pull on my dick
Tell the DJ don't even tell them we in here we on the low
No thuggin' in the V.I.P for me and my niggas we on the floor
We finna get this party started right could you put some thug music on
They think I'm buzzin' cause I'm shake my ass
But I got nephews and cousins watchin' you flashin' yo cash (oh yeah)
We them niggas that are so thirty million
Partner that don't make a difference we see money we gon get it (fell me)
