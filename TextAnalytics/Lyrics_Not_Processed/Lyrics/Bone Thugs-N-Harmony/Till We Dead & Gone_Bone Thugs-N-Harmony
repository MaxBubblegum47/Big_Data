[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Little Lay done traveled around the world Caught a few cases
Seen so many faces and so many places Ace this game
Why do you try to erase this on a daily basis
Give me my spaces Show me some love though
Just pump your fist in the air and holler "Mo"
Could you do me that and I'll hit you back
Little nig just don't know where my thugs at
Some at the track on the back chrome gat
Some around the corner selling that crack
Some of my thugs in the penn dead wrong
Got a lot of my thugs in the grave long gone
May they rest in peace My nigga sleep
Nigga be creep thugging till we all deceased

Lord bless 'em please bless thier seed
For real we tru to the thugs representing that Land
Putting it down for the nation of thugs man
So you understand Now whats wrong with your game
Wounds be getting to shooting Fuck the law
Keep packing that steel real real when your riding the feel just chill
And peace will be still nigga from Cleveland to New Orleans
Across the sea and ocean Master P and Bone thugs Coast to coast
