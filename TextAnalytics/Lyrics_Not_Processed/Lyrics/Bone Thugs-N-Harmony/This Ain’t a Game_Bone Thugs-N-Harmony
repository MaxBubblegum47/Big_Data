[Lil' Eazy-E & Krayzie Bone]
God bless these niggas like ha'chu (they wanna die, they wanna die)
Cuz I'll leave a nigga dead if I have to (this ain't a game)
Praying to the Lord tell him touch you (they wanna die, they wanna die)
Cuz I'll leave your ass dead nigga fuck you (nigga this ain't a game)

[Lil' Eazy-E]
Little Eazy, young G in the CPT
Westcoast to the casket drop, (in south) block and I got that key
Straight gangsta I'm just trying to see who the fuck these hoes trying to be
In the hood it's understood Don't fuck around with Eazy-E
You cross him, it's mayhem, you owe him, just pay him
Anything else you asking for a nickel and a timly passin'
But it's all to the good in hood brings the wood
Like we should all night long on this Compton shit with Bone

[Lil' Eazy-E & Krayzie Bone]
God bless these niggas like ha'chu (they wanna die, they wanna die)
Cuz I'll leave a nigga dead if I have to (this ain't a game)
Praying to the Lord tell him touch you (they wanna die, they wanna die)
Cuz I'll leave your ass dead nigga fuck you (nigga this ain't a game)

[Layzie Bone]
Ain't nobody taking mine, and no it's not a game
I'mma leave a nigga dead in the streets (streets)
So let the word get around, I'mma lay a nigga down
If he ever think he better than me
See they can never compete
A heat seeker, infa-red creeper, real blood leaker
Coming through your speaker listen up close
Cause it's about to get deeper
About 6 feet I gotta sleeper with the reaper
9 milimeter go bang bang ba da da dang ba da da dar dang
Watch a little nigga do his thang, thang, he do his thang, you know I do my thang
I'mma rep for the Godfather
Gangsta music please believe me
Eric Wright's still bombin on 'em deuce double O'six with the seeds of Eazy

[Lil' Eazy-E & Krayzie Bone]
God bless these niggas like ha'chu (they wanna die, they wanna die)
Cuz I'll leave a nigga dead if I have to (this ain't a game)
Praying to the Lord tell him touch you (they wanna die, they wanna die)
Cuz I'll leave your ass dead nigga fuck you (nigga this ain't a game)

[Wish]
First off I'mma let 'em know Bone-Thugs, little-E thug it coast to coast
I ain't gone lie nigga get raw you can feel that fire better go on boy
In the hood yes everday cause I still got the hood in me this in me
If your in position better get it better get it complete It
Take that laid back but I'm still the Top Dog when things go down from Cleveland
To Compton you need me just holla thugs in big trucks
We real won't doubt ready for problems every single day
Chasing money man It don't seem I can think about another thing

[Krayzie Bone]
It's another coming at ya, so you better pray
It's Mr. Sawed-Off just call me Leatherface
Here 2 brang drama if they really wanna it
But I don't think they really want it
If they knew just what I do to my opponent
Gonna be another murder moment
Ruff and rugged thuggish, ruggish, keep it ole soul gully
Really I'm knowing they ain't ready to see us put in down
With Little Eazy-E, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
Always ready to get down
For whatever when ever you wanna go a couple rounds, c'mon
So anybody wanting beef, run up
We got it hot off the grill, son of the real
Raised on these streets man
So the treal, gonna recognize treal
Look whatever deal, the case, the situations none of y'all can never see Kray
We got 'em all trying to listen up and observe
The words hitting replay like man what did he say

[Lil' Eazy-E & Krayzie Bone]
God bless these niggas like ha'chu (they wanna die, they wanna die)

[Lil' Eazy-E & Krayzie Bone]
It'll be one less nigga, fucking around with my figures
Yo' ass won't get no bigger
I'm so fast when I pull that trigger, don't test me
E.S.C. for me new generation Compton G
In the hood it's understood, don't fuck around with Eazy-E
(Gotta get that paper, paper)
(Gotta get that money man)
Gotta have these hoes on point when I sit back and smoke this joint
(Gotta make that money man)
(Gotta get that paper, paper)
Do you nigga I can't hate ya keep it gangsta that's my nature

[Lil' Eazy-E & Krayzie Bone]
