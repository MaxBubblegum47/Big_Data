[Hook]
I can feel it in the air
Can you feel it (Summer love)(yeahh)
I can see it everywere
Can you see it (Summer Love)(yeahh) x2
All winter we been on the grind
Waiting on the summer time
Anxious for the time to shine
Show'em how they suppose to rhyme

[Krayzie Verse]
We finna hit up the cold big store
Put up some dough
C'mon you rollin with Kray
Hey this could be another wonderful day
Grandady on my drop top caddy
Groupin on a fattie
Swoopin through the alley
You can find me
Doin it at the park
Until the po-po come
And ruin it after dark
Ohhh
Noo
But we gonna try our best to keep it crackin
Light it up to the break of dawn
And just don't stop

[Hook]
I can feel it in the air
Can you feel it (Summer love)(yeahh)
I can see it everywere
Can you see it (Summer Love)(yeahh) x2
All winter we been on the grind
Waiting on the summer time
Anxious for the time to shine
Show'em how they suppose to rhyme

[Layzie Bone]
Break out the grills
Pull out the cars
All the players at the car wash
The ladies showing skin
I guess the sun is bringing the stars out
I just wanna ball out
Hit some sticky
As I'm smoking and leaning
Go by the mall out
I love it when im so fresh and so clean
Step on the scene
Like new money man
You know what I mean (yeaah)
I got the feelin the feelin
Just like a million
Not worry about a thing just chillin

[Hook]
I can feel it in the air
Can you feel it (Summer love)(yeahh)
I can see it everywere
Can you see it (Summer Love)(yeahh) x2
All winter we been on the grind
Waiting on the summer time
Anxious for the time to shine
Show'em how they suppose to rhyme

[Wish Bone]
Motorcycle rollin
Him not because they know me
Slide through
Ride through
Then what
He don't want it
Grab something from the back
Snatch off something off from the fat back
And girlie girlies love when I ride that
Fast or slow
I'mma take her where she need to go
Hold on tight
It's summer time
So we ridin all night
If it gets too cold we can jump in whatever
Continue enjoying this good good weather

[Hook]
I can feel it in the air (Summer love)(yeahh)
Can you feel it (Summer Love )(yeahh)
I can see it everywere (Summer Love)(yeahh)
Can you see it (Summer Love) x4
