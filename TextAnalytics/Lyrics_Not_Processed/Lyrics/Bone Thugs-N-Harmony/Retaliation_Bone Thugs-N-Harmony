[DJ U-Neek]
Guess who's back?
(Scream + loud gunshot)
Right about now it's time for those notorious thugs
Bizzy, Wish, Layzie, Krayzie
Flesh and that nigga DJ U-Neek
Mo' Thug takin' over so you best beware
'Cause we came to shut this motherfucka down

[Layzie Bone and DJ U-Neek]
Yeah, Bone comin' back at you bitches for the '97
Yeah, these mothafuckas didn't think it was on
Old playa-hatin' ass niggas you know my lil' niggas brung they style to the table first
Nigga, why don't you realize, recognize, idolize?
It's over bitch, it's the art of war

Abort, when it's the art of war
One and two world war
Playa playa we done party over time
