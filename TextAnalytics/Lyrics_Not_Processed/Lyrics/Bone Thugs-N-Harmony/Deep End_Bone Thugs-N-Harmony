[Intro: Por'cha & 
Bizzy Bone
]
Bone Thugs
Told Young to read the business page, y'all could bring the business
B-b-back to smokin' weed again, would expect a lot more singin'
Got a [?] poppin' X's on the West side with Puerto Ricans
To the bridge walkin', tryna shake this buzz, heart beatin'

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Two witnesses just died for fuckin' with my mind
Now that's way before I thought reduction, I was crushin niggas' spines
Kawasaki shots, Mu gu tai van vai
Swingin' on Thug Queen, she was down to ride
Word to Capo, s-s-s-seven shots, one to the dome
Thievery wrong, my nigga popped a joke, won't make it home
Little niggas on powder, that's crack to me
From my old days, a little clam chowder, hey, for my old ways
My record company niggas got paid
Then like a Gotti move, my record company niggas got slayed
Don't anybody move, dude, that's like err-body
Party over, pass the shotty
I ain't call the move but it was sort of kind of 'cun de grati'

[Porcha]
Don't have to care about me
'cause my beat bangs
You can't fuck with thee
Bone Thugs speaking
So stop thinking
Have your weekend
Push you in the deep end
Don't have to care about me
'cause my beat bangs
You can't fuck with thee
Bone Thugs speaking
So stop thinking
Have your weekend
Push you in the deep end

[Layzie Bone]
It's my definition
On high definition
No boss in this bitch
I decide the decisions
The life that I'm living
No fringes, not women
It's rude to the core
Ain't never no gimmicks
Ain't never no limits
Can you dig it? Hear me?
Lights to the camera, action, we on
Blue to the tubes, the truths in this song
No hoods, still fools
My legacy live long
Thugs wanna beat me
See me on TV
Looking like a [?]
And make it look easy
R&B, Eazy-E 'cause he gone
We full Bone, my nigga full blown
And I'm on
My family coming with we
We strong
Packed and up and getting filthy filthy rich

[Porcha]
Don't have to care about me
'cause my beat bangs
You can't fuck with thee
Bone Thugs speaking
So stop thinking
Have your weekend
Push you in the deep end
Don't have to care about me
'cause my beat bangs
You can't fuck with thee
Bone Thugs speaking
So stop thinking
Have your weekend
Push you in the deep end

[Wish Bone]
Cut off lights and all the cameras
My life is action packed
Full of drama
Full of adventure
The Golden Globe, it goes to [?] (who?)
No acting, that's a fact
Since God wrote the script it's all real
If you can't face reality pop a pill
They say these kids trying to kill my character
It's hard enough trying to survive in America
Hate to be a visionary, ordinary
This is historical
You haters can try to take that but can't have it
Bone Thugs
Made it big
Legendary status

[Porcha]
Don't have to care about me
'cause my beat bangs
You can't fuck with thee
Bone Thugs speaking
So stop thinking
Have your weekend
Push you in the deep end
Don't have to care about me
'cause my beat bangs
You can't fuck with thee
Bone Thugs speaking
So stop thinking
Have your weekend
Push you in the deep end
