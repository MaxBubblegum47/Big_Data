[Hook 4X: Thin C] + (Felecia)
What the hell is goin onnnnn?
(These are our blocks, these are our hoods, these are our streets)

[Layzie Bone]
It's a war zone in the poor zone, we chasin after the fortune
In the belly of the beast is scorchin, little kids is forced to tote guns
We so numb it's like fo-fum, bloody redrum for the income
Refusin to be a victim, we do it and take it and then some
Tryna get out, and give back, the government givin us no slack
They double up on our taxes, send us to jail because we sell crack
But them airplanes been flyin, since Reagan was the president
Was evident, seem irrelevant, what's the relevance to your precedence
Let us live, quit willie lynchin, Layzie Bone got the heart to mention
The reason we live in attention, cause the po-po a gang of henchmen
Who resistin, quit trippin, I'm just tryin to earn a livin
Tryin to go up against the system, keepin my ass up out of prison
Listen, you younger niggas, you got to have vision
If you see it you can read it, Jesus died for the vision
But the vision is to walk with swag, hold your head and walk in brag
Never let 'em make you mad, rep yo' set and get the cash

Emergin from the cig' butt, showin up, comin up
Barbecues by the pool, the neighbors can't believe it's you
Livin how you will, house up on the hill
Rides with big wheels, it's they worst nightmare
Gimme mines right here, dark skin, curly hair
Soul man, African-American
I don't mind your kid starin at my dude, dancin to my tunes
It don't matter cause we set the trend for everything they do
Put the road to the wheel, put the fire in your meal
Took the dog from your wife, put the log in her life
Now it's all about you get it cause yo' shit real light
We the ones that keep it poppin and got the whole world vibin
You wanna get in our minds, cause we got the perfect timin
To build a whole new world, take my gold and my diamonds
But it's okay cause I'm rhymin, chasin this money and grindin
Up the ladder I'm climbin - and you can clock me as I roll by!

(Gotta know what's goin on, better know what's goin on)
(Gotta know what's goin on, better know what's goin on)
