[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
My my babys bangin
Beefin with me
Squashed it ordained it
Better yet sustained the flurry
Hide in the fury
But the ways of a broad
Don't mean you've died out of my life
I'm hurt, burn me baby
Tie down
And child hood scars
Crackhead cause niggas I dont know
That who'd ya think you are
And here we are, steady we roll out over you
When it's over it's over
For the soldiers who hear me, that'll
Get me in trouble
Can I be closer, stay right near me
Here we are, ain't no stars, uh huh.......
Can I get drunk off in some bar
Without some haters sayin
"Who do you think you are?!"
When I'm sober, start jumpin in it to win itttt.........

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Shit I bet they thought we fell off
Bone Thugs~n~Harmony Resurrection
Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish
We in the Flesh
Rememeber them thuggish ruggish niggas
Gotta get down fo my thang in here
You already know when we came in here we raw
Fuck what u heard and you read about us
Just believe what you saw
Till I die, Im down to ride in the war
When you niggas get serious, let a nigga know
Maybe then we can roll
Nigga bad to the Bone
But I sure dont click with hoes
And no bustas, hatas, or hoes when
They poppin up at my door
I get excited, all uptight, and violent
Bitches was not invited!
Put'em in a coffin before they get me man
Krayzie, loco, insane, bang bang
Runnin with the pump pump, no bluffin
We buck!
Nigga better realize still claim
Nineteen nine nine the nine nine
Muthafucka, fuck'em to the end
And when I run out
I reloadin and buckin again, some mo!
Nigga puttin it down, worldwide
Them wicked bad-ass thugs
You punk niggas hate us
But we don't trip
We still get madd ass love
I show you the rapper that's sick of this song
We'll straight up toss his ass
And if he flossin cash and jewelry
Rip it off his ass
Keep walkin fast
Thuggish ruggish till the day that I die
Fuck it that's all I been all of my life
It's just T-H-U-G we be
And it ain't no thang
Keep buckin buckin
Dumpin, fuckin'em bustas up with my gauge
We poppin all yall
Im watchin all yall

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone & Krayzie Bone]
Money ain't a thang, I'ma get me some
My nigga I'ma get me some
Say my nigga yall, better get your paper
Paper, paper, paper, paper, paper
Money ain't a thang, I'ma get me some
My nigga I'ma get me some
Say my nigga yall, better get your paper
Paper, paper, paper, paper, paper
Money ain't a thang

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Time after time
Everywhere I look
Everywhere I turn
Niggas talkin bout death
Like a nigga can't dream of nuthin else
But a lil bit of wealth
Tryin to help they self
And I really can't blame you
Cause I do the same too
Man do what you gotta do
But what I'mma do is keep protectin my cheddar fool
Ain't none of yall niggas do it betta, ohhh
And Im ahead of you and yall hate it
Only the real thugs keepin it raw
Grippin that heat tight
Livin that street life
Nigga I'mma let it fool round and get war
Niggas is plottin that 2-11
Thats why I got heat for armageddon
Picture Lay on his knees and I'm beggin
Nigga betta shoot me and send me to heaven
Fuck all the drama, I'mma just blast
Hollow point tips off in that ass
Tha slicka the nigga
Thats pullin the trigga
Is the nigga thats standin up last
Countin this cash
Still doin this mash
Blowin much weed
As we watch you bleed
Nigga got killed fo the love of the cheese
Now you can't do shit cause your 6 feet deep
Fuckin with Lay
Is a game you shouldn't play
Even myself I could die today
I could lie, but hey it ain't worth it
Shit, ain't none of us here to stay
I'mma hold my ground
And I'mma lace my boots
So when its time to shoot, then thats it
Screamin out Mo Thug in this bitch
And Bone Thugs in this bitch, nigga

[Verse 4: Wish Bone & (Bizzy Bone)]
It's all about money, yeah
I'mma get me some
Can't be fuckin with niggas that ain't got none
Cause lately yall been actin funny
I guess you smell some money
Get out my pockets
Betta count your shit
It's still St. Clair wig-split
Four other niggas that I run with
You dont wanna fuck with

[Dollars and dollars but still,]

[We gotta get mo]
Remember back in the days when we was fucked up
But not anymore (uh uh, no, no)
And ain't a damn thang come easy
Alot of plannin, bus rides, and [Eazy]
Fo cheese
Believe me
Believe me
And it ain't gone stop at the end of my time
With my Bone Thug love
I'mma always get mine
And I mean that
Gotta have that
Paper paper
Money money
Money, money

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone & Krayzie Bone]
Money ain't a thang, I'ma get me some
My nigga I'ma get me some
Say my nigga yall, better get your paper
Paper, paper, paper, paper, paper
Money ain't a thang, I'ma get me some
My nigga I'ma get me some
Say my nigga yall, better get your paper
Paper, paper, paper, paper, paper
Money ain't a thang

[Verse 5: Flesh-N-Bone & (Layzie Bone)]
You better believe we five of the last
True soldiers standin' in command
You thought of me closin the book
On this bitch on ya'll, flip on yall
I am what I am the Fifth Dawg!
It's all good
Paper paper for the whole hood
Tell'em I got dibs on this and kids in this
(you the realest, realest)
Reminiscin on my thug ass nigga Eazy-E (Eazy-E)
Six deep in a six-double-o Benzo
Fo the love of money
I gotta get the paper
I told yall ain't a damn thang changed
Bout the nigga they bang
My niggas,they're down
And we'll bang your brain
Muthafucka for thinkin he famous!

[Bridge: Bizzy Bone & Layzie Bone]
We in the flesh flesh
We in the flesh
We in the flesh flesh
We in the flesh

[Verse 6: Flesh-N-Bone]
And if I can go bite the bullet
So Eazy in my cadillac
Bend a couple of corners
Smoke out with some hoes
Now where yall at?
21st century heroes
Two-triple-zero
Righteous ones
And wish the Howse
Then can roll with one hundred and forty four thousand
