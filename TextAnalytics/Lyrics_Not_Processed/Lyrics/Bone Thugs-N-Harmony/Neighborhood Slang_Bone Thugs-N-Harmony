187 is a lesson for them niggas
That want to test
Bring more than cause me shotgun
Will be buckin your chest
Wanna be Mo' thug?   thugsta mentality
Runs through the BONE
Pop pop to the dome
Fall short to the crome
Gift wrap that bitch ass on
Much love for the green leaves
But me trues have to ease me down
Puff puff head rush
Popin in me clip and I got plenty rounds
Me no pretenda
No studio thugsta
Wanna get wit'cha
And if me miss ya
Straight #1 and the Rispsta
Swang watch 'em hit cha
So we can swang (we can swang)
Down foe my thang (down foe my thang)
Finna blow to tha brain
Thought you could hang
When I swang them thangs
That's insane!
Stay low (stay low)
Dem popo know me no surrender
Dem niggas on the street they remember Bone as being no pretenda
Standin up on the block
9mm cocked in me hand
And me got my niggas lookin out for me back
And them watch for them rocks
And you know its nuthin but the neighboorhood thang
Its manditory for me neighboorhood slang
