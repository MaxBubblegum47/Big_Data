[Verse 1: James Hersey]
She thinks I can never understand, that we don't seem to ever take the chance
When one day I'm the only, one who can, and two days later I'm gone

[Hook: James Hersey]
Make your mind up and tell me when you've made your mind up
Make your mind up and tell me when you've made your mind up

[Verse 2: James Hersey]
Someday she can never understand, that I'm just not that kind of workingman
Who needs some one to be there holding hands, or wants some place to call home

[Hook: James Hersey]
So make your mind up, and tell me when you've made your mind up
Make your mind up, and tell me when you've made your mind up

[Bridge: James Hersey]
Uuuuuuuuh tell me what I've done, for you to be so cold
For you to find someone, someone new to hold
Oooooh just tell me what I've done

[Outro: James Hersey]
Uuuuuuuuh I'm gonna make my mind up, and tell her when I've made my mind up
Make my mind up, and tell her when I've made my mind up
