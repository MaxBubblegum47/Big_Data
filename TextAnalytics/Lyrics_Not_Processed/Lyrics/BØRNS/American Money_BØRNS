[Verse 1]
I was there when you fell from the clouds
And landed in the desert
There was a thunder inside of my heart
There was a wonderful pleasure
And like a stallion racin' the rain
You rode on the back of my bike
I knew from the song that you sang
You were my lover for life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's no time to sleep
Oh, living in a dream

[Chorus]
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimmin' in the sunlight every day
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money

[Verse 2]
So we took to the calico road
Running from the weather (Uh-oh)
There was a highway inside of her eyes
There was a buried treasure
And we got caught in the storm
You started flying a kite
At the end was the key to my heart
You were my lover for life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's no time to sleep (There's no time to sleep)
Oh, living in a dream

[Chorus]
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimmin' in the sunlight every day
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money

[Bridge]
We carved our love in the mountainside
We soaked our hearts in the rain
And I, waited my whole life, for you

[Chorus]
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimmin' in the sunlight every day
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money
