[Intro]
Hearts in a cage

[Verse 1]
Hearts in a cage, hearts in a cage
You, you flipped the page and slipped away

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Never thought that you were
Someone to say things that you didn't mean

[Chorus 1]
You didn't even call to wish me sweet dreams
Really thought we made a sweet team
But don't cry
Consider this a lullaby
Bye and sweet dreams

[Verse 2]
Ticking clocks on the wall waiting for your call
But that cuckoo bird won't sing at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Never thought you would
Take everything we had and loved and leave

[Chorus 2]
You didn't even call to wish me sweet dreams
Really thought we made a sweet team
But don't cry, can't you see that you're a love of mine?
Sweet dreams, always thought you were the sweetest thing
But don't cry, consider this a lullaby - bye
Them sweet dreams, sweet dreams
Sweet dreams, oh, sweet dreams
