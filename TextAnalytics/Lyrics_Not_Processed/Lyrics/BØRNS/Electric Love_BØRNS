[Verse 1]
Candy, she's sweet like candy in my veins
Baby, I'm dying for another taste

[Pre-Chorus]
And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder

[Chorus]
Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love (Ohh)
Baby, your electric love (Ahh)
Electric love

[Verse 2]
Drown me (Drown me), you make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me, hold me deep beneath your waves
(Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder and louder

[Chorus]
Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love (Ohh)
Baby, your electric love (Ahh)
Electric love

[Bridge]
(Ohh)
Rushing through me
Feel your energy rushing through me
Feel your energy rushing through me

[Chorus]
Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love (Ohh)
Baby, your electric love (Ahh)
Baby, you're electric
