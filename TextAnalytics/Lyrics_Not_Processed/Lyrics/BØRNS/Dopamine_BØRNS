[Intro]
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
(Ahh)

[Verse 1]
I mixed up so terribly
Your body language talkin' over me
And it might not be logical
But, baby, my mind just won't let you leave

[Pre-Chorus]
And I crave your taste under my tongue every day
(All day)
Keep the forbidden fruit comin' my way
I wanna feel your sugar in my veins
Baby, just wanna feel

[Chorus]
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine (Ahh)
You sip what the devil's drinkin'
Hot as hell and I'm thinkin'
Baby, baby, baby, can you take away my pain?
Baby, baby, baby, can you take away my pain?

[Verse 2]
Baby, I don't wanna think about it
All I wanna be is under your control
Sound of your spell, locked in your eyes
Under your influence, don't let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
And I crave your taste under my tongue every day
(All day)
Keep the forbidden fruit comin' my way (My way)
I wanna feel your sugar in my veins (My veins)
Baby, just wanna feel

[Chorus]
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine (Ahh)
You sip what the devil's drinkin'
Hot as hell and I'm thinkin'
Baby, baby, baby, can you take away my pain
Baby, baby, baby, can you take away my pain

[Bridge]
(Woo, ahh, ahh)
Layin' in your ecstasy, I'm floatin' away (Woo, ahh, ahh)
Layin' in your ecstasy, I'm floatin' away (Woo, ahh)

[Chorus]
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine (Ahh)
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine
Wanna feel that stream of dopamine (Ahh)
You sip what the devil's drinkin'
Hot as hell and I'm thinkin'
Baby, baby, baby, can you take away my pain?
Baby, baby, baby, can you take away my pain?

[Outro]
Layin' in your ecstasy, I'm floatin' away
Layin' in your ecstasy, I'm floatin' away
Layin' in your ecstasy, I'm floatin' away
Layin' in your ecstasy, I'm floatin' away
