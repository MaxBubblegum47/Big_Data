[Verse 1: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you’ll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it

[Refrain: Logic]
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
I said oh my (Oh my)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Somebody pinch me
Black man screaming, trying to convince me I’m not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn, my skin fair but life’s not
And I'd be lying if I said I didn’t care what whites thought
Or black people said, shit
Maybe it’s in my head
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

[Chorus: Logic]
(Oh my) Oh my
(Oh my) Like the white woman said oh my
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Ohhh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I don’t feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
'Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah

[Verse 3: Logic]
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Don’t wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
I’m taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit don’t make a dent in how I’m feeling
And yes I’m willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I’m low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my

[Refrain: Logic]
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my
(I said oh)

[Verse 4: Logic]
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you’ll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street

Go back in time to when my nigga daddy

Oh my (My oh my)

Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida

Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida

Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her

I don’t feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my

[Bridge: Logic]
Sometimes I can’t get you out of my mind
Baby, no I just can’t find, I just can’t find
Such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind, such a beautiful state of mind
Beautiful state of mind
Sometimes everyday right on time
But right now in my mind
It feels like I'm living on borrowed time

[Verse 5: Logic]

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one

[Outro: J. Cole]
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap
When it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, acceptance
