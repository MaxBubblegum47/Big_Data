[Intro: J. Cole]
Cole World
Southside
Can’t get enough, can’t get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet, but that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter, pro'bly make a gay nigga reconsider
You're now rockin' with the best, mane, dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane, let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl, ‘cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name, ‘cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
She said
“I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Chorus: J. Cole (Trey Songz)]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot
Try to let go but I just cannot, so don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey
Globetrotter, Cole hotter, even way out in London town
Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound and I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night, that’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight, tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight, on the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head, I hate it when you give me headaches

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
She said
“I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Chorus: J. Cole (Trey Songz)]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot
Try to let go but I just cannot, so don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 3:  J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain’t nothin' sunny, I see ‘em hating, but it ain’t nuttin' to me
I’m from the Ville where they bang for the money and carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred? Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track, I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr
That’s the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track, I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
She said
“I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Chorus: J. Cole (Trey Songz)]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot
Try to let go but I just cannot, so don’t you stop, I need that.”
