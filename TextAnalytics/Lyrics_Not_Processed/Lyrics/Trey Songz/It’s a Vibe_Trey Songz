Late night
Oh it's a vibe
Let me slide
Oh it's a vibe, yeah, yeah
Dim the lights
Oh it's a vibe, yeah
Get high
It's a vibe, oh it's a vibe, yeah

[Verse 2: Trey Songz & 2 Chainz]
It's a vibe
Don't you like?
Your pussy drippin'
Gushin', drippin' down your thighs
It's a vibe
Get high
Diggin' deep while I'm lookin' in your eyes
Vibe is the realest
I know you feel it (yah)
It's a vibe (vibe)
Different vibe
This my vibe, nigga
All the bitches like it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Okay, so I got the ambiance just where I want it (yeah)
And if you get paid, it's solely based on your performance (TRU)
My ego is enormous like my crib in California (hmm)
If you ain't got no heart, man you gonna need a donor
Now I said I'm from the corner of the ATL (yah)
Where we got that clientele, avoid paper trails (right)
Broke so many bales down that I'm shell shocked (bow)
I held Glocks, sold rocks by the mailbox (ooh)
Got a vibe, make a yellow chick turn her neck (alright)
Got a vibe, make a cougar wanna spend a check (check)
Got a vibe, make an Asian want hibachi (hibachi)
Got a vibe, make Italian want Versace (Versace)
Carbon copies get declined, I'm the pioneer
Beat that pussy up, I need riot gear
Any volunteers?
Gas in a Ziploc, now that's loud and clear
This one outta here, this is our year

[Verse 4: Jhen√© Aiko]
That's a vibe
That's a vibe
That's a vibe
Oh that's a vibe, yeah, yeah
That's a vibe
It's a vibe
It's a vibe
That's a vibe, yeah, yeah
It's a vibe
Am I your type?
Pussy tight
Maybe I'll spend the night, yeah, yeah
That's a vibe
Bust it, bust it wide
This the type of shit I like, yeah, yeah
That's a vibe
It's a vibe
That's a vibe
Oh it's a vibe, yeah, yeah
It's a vibe, yeah, yeah, yeah
