[Verse 1: August Alsina]
A nigga back with the motherfuckin' remix (Remix) and we 'bout to kill this shit (Oh)
See I went and got a little help to get the whole club poppin' like Freaknik
'Cause I got Rozay, a little Bombay, a little peach Ciroc and we faded
Soon as we step in, we got your chick and yo' chick and yo' chick and I know you hate it
'Cause we linin' up the shots (Shots)
Youngin' got the heat to make 'em pop
Soon as we hit the parkin' lot
Then we see all the panties drop
Girl, ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no snitch nigga
Your bitch choosin' on a real nigga, let her chill nigga, that's real
'Cause I'm so fucked up, now I'm talkin' my shit
I'm way too high to be trippin' like this
Niggas hatin' hard, bitches all on my dick
This is what you want, I'ma put it like this
Lay it down to the Aug', Trey and Chris remix

[Chorus: August Alsina]
Say you love it, ayy, you love it, girl, ayy
You love it, ayy, you love it, girl, uh-huh
You love it, ayy, say you love it, girl, ayy
You love it, ayy, better make you love it, girl, uh-huh
The way I fuck her, you would think I love this bitch
I tell her keep on suckin', girl, get all this dick
And I'ma keep grindin', nigga tryna get rich
She tell me, "Keep fuckin'," 'cause she love this shit

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Goddamn it, I love it
She said she just got her some titties (She said she just got her some titties)
Can't wait 'til I come to her city (Can't wait 'til I come to her city)
I smoke 'til I choke and I'm dizzy
The liquor's invadin' my kidneys
Been chillin' and I feel like killin' you niggas
 (Oh)
Bitches been missin' me lately (Oh)
They love it when I talk to 'em crazy (Oh)
Suck a nigga dick, do it with a lot of spit
Let it drip, yeah, catch my babies
Oh-whoa, that's my baby (Baby)
Just do it like you care
, girl, don't worry 'bout your
Hair's fucked up 'cause I'm pullin' it like this
Your man's fucked up, he don't do you like this
Feels so good that a nigga might kiss
If you ask her, she gon' tell you like this

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Goddamn it, she loves it, she loves it
She loves it, loves it
Goddamn it, she loves it, she loves it
She loves it, she loves it
So I'ma keep on fuckin' like I love this bitch
I'ma keep her bustin' 'cause she loves this dick (Woah-oh-oh)
I'ma keep stuntin' 'cause I love being rich
I'ma keep doin' it, I does this shit, goddamn it, I love it (Woah-oh-oh)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
She said make love, just make love
Just make love to me right now (Just do it)
And she want to try some new shit (Just do it)
She said when I kiss it, gon' and sing to her (How?)
Like this, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Oh, woah, do it, do it)
No need for conversation
All we doin' is lickin' and fuckin' and touchin'
Your booty be speakin' another language, oh yeah
This real life to his fake shit
Bottles in the air, I'm faded, drinkin'
I'm so fucked up, now I'm talkin' my shit (Oh)
I'm so bossed up, I be talkin' like Rich
Niggas hatin' hard, bitches all on my dick
Baby, when we play, put this song on replay
She like, "Ooh, that's my shit"

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And I love it, ayy, I love it, ayy
I love it, ayy, I
Goddamn it I love it, baby, ayy
I love it, ayy, I love it, ayy, I
I'm gon' love her better 'cause her man ain't shit
And I'ma keep on strokin' 'cause she love this dick
And I'ma keep on lickin' 'cause she love it
She tell me "Keep fuckin'," 'cause she loves this shit

[Outro: August Alsina]
And I love it
