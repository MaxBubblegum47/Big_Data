Oh, I'm sorry, oh, you mad that I came to the party?

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]

[Chorus: Trey Songz]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, sometimes I tell 'em I love 'em because I just wanna fuck 'em
I never love 'em or cuff 'em, and when we done I'ma duck 'em
He Ferragamo the buckle, he Louis V on the duffel
The pussy wetter than puddles, I ride his dick like a shuttle
I said, real niggas let real bitches come first (Come first)
And real bitches been bad bitches from birth (From birth)
Uh, kiss him when he cumming (Oh)
Make more money last year than Mister Drummond
(Kyuhh) Oh, he like it when I ride it slow

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I'm touchin' you tonight, I'm lovin' you tonight (Uh, yeah, uh)
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you, girl
You must be used to spendin', putting in that time
 (Uh-huh)
Touchin', lovin', fuckin', can't make up my mind (My mind, oh, oh)
Nicky, you know that I love you
I'm lovin' you (Oh, oh)
And I really wanna touch it
(Wait, no) I'm fuckin' you tonight

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
