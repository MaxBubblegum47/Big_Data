Baby you should know
I've got my life off the road
Since you're gone
Drinking all night long
Bitches lay where you belong
Now I'm trying to become a better me
Better than I used to be
Better than now for sure

Like you do x4
Trying to find my way
Find my way back home
Like you do x4
When we fall down

Ohh baby girl when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Ohh baby girl when you dance like that
When you love like that

A hundred fuckin miles seperates
Between me and my girl
And all I need to know is if my girl is gone for real
Coming back to the place where it all began
Bitches in my bed again
Maybe I don't need to feel

Like you do x4
Trying to find my way
Find my way back home
Like you do x4
When we fall down

Ohh baby girl when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Ohh baby girl when you dance like that
When you love like that

Going every night tryna find bitches to impress
Gotta love the emptiness
Gettin high through every fear
Bitches layin' on the floor passin' out again
Puke the money that they've spent
Baby I don't need to feel

Like you do x4
Trying to find my way
Find my way back home
Like you do x4
When we fall down

Ohh baby girl when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Ohh baby girl when you dance like that
When you love like that
