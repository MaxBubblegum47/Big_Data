[Intro]
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, never mind, never mind
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, never mind, never mind

[Verse]
Alright, I'm ready now, ready now
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna fall back down, no
Alright, I'll take it on, take it on me
Take it on me, hmm, baby
All I, I ever ask, ever ask
Are you gonna, are you gonna be my lover?
Tonight, and take it with, take it with me
Take it with me

[Chorus]
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind

[Verse]
Alright, I'm ready now, ready now
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna stop right now, no
Alright, I'll take it on, take it on me
Take it on me, ooh baby
All I, I ever ask, ever ask is
Do you wanna, do you wanna see my fire
Tonight, and take it with, take it with me
Take it with me, hmm baby?

[Chorus]
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind
What if I left and it made no sense
And you tell your friends
And they hold your hands
Baby, never mind, never mind
Never mind, never mind
