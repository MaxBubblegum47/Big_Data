[Intro]
Oh, when we fuck
Oh, when we fuck
Oh, when we fuck
Oh, when we fuck

[Verse]
I gave you everything
You gave me nothing for what I have done
I gave you everything
You gave me reasons, oh, baby, I'm done
You had no aura, I had no wings
You had your troubles and I had my things
I wrote you a letter, "Dear future wife
You brought the emptiness into my life"

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on my own, I'm better alone
And now that you're gone, yeah, I feel alive
I'm on my own, I'm better alone
And now that you're gone, yeah, I feel alive

[Chorus]
When you hold me like that, when you touch me like that
When we fuck, oh, when we fuck
Well, I'm burning myself and I'm hurting myself
When we fuck, oh, when we fuck

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Bridge]
Oh, when we fuck
Oh, when we fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on my own, I'm better alone
And now that you're gone, yeah, I feel alive
I'm on my own, I'm better alone
And now that you're gone, yeah, I feel alive

[Chorus]
When you hold me like that, when you touch me like that
When we fuck, oh, when we fuck
Well, I'm burning myself and I'm hurting myself
When we fuck, oh, when we fuck

[Outro]
I'm on my own, I'm better alone
And now that you're gone, yeah, I feel alive
I'm on my own, I'm better alone
And now that you're gone, yeah, I feel alive
