[Intro]
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
Turn around, turn around, look around yourself
And think about it, think about it
Pack your bags, get a flight to the nowhere land
Don't think about it, think about it
All the motherfucking haters tryna bring you down
Don't think about them, think about me
Do you wanna live your life in their lonely way?
Think about it, think about it

[Chorus]
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)

[Verse 2]
Put your little middle finger in the air right now
Don't think about it, think about it
Fuck the world, I'm alive and I won't go down
Think about it, think about it
Turn around, turn around, look around yourself
Don't think about them, think about me
Chasing ghosts all your life wouldn't bring them back
Think about it, think about it

[Chorus]
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)

[Bridge]
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no

[Chorus]
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)

No, no, no, no 
(No, no, no, no)
