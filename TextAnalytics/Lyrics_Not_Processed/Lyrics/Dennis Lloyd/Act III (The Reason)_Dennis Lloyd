[Verse 1]
Fuck you, I'm a mess but I'd never feel ashamed
You got a fucking problem? Baby this is who I am
I know that I'm the only one that you can ever blame
But I just won't take it on me
Three weeks in a row but we've never left the bed
You used to call me player, used to say that I pretend
But you never really knew that I have meant what I have said
It's time for you to get the hell away from my head
Baby I'm not

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not the reason that you walk away
Baby I'm not
I'm not the reason, baby
Yeah, I'm not the reason
Take all your bags and get the hell away
Baby I'm not
I'm not the reason, baby
Yeah, I'm not the reason

[Chorus]
I'm not the reason that you walk away
Baby I'm not
I'm not the reason, baby
Yeah, I'm not the reason
Take all your bags and get the hell away
Baby I'm not
I'm not the reason, baby
Yeah, I'm not the reason

[Verse 2]
I took the wrong way out as the mother fuckin' song
I'm trying to get you out of here where you think that you belong
I know that you won't ever really say that you were wrong
But I just couldn't take it on me
Breakdown, tears fall, three weeks and I'm gone
I'm like a hurricane and that's the reason I'm alone
I touch and I destroy that's why I'm living on my own
It's time for me to stop 'cause I'm hurting you girl
But baby I'm not

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not the reason that you walk away
Baby I'm not
I'm not the reason, baby
Yeah, I'm not the reason
Take all your bags and get the hell away
Baby I'm not
I'm not the reason, baby
Yeah, I'm not the reason

[Chorus]
I'm not the reason that you walk away
Baby I'm not
I'm not the reason, baby
Yeah, I'm not the reason
Take all your bags and get the hell away
Baby I'm not
I'm not the reason, baby
Yeah, I'm not the reason

[Trumpet Break]

[Chorus]
I'm not the reason that you walk away
Baby I'm not
I'm not the reason, baby
Yeah, I'm not the reason
Take all your bags and get the hell away
Baby I'm not
I'm not the reason, baby
Yeah, I'm not the reason
