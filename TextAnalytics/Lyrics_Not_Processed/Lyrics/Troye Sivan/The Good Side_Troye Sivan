[Verse 1]
I got the good side of things
Left you with both of the rings
My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
The change in the wind took you down to your knees
I got the good side of you
Send it out into the blue
The people danced to the sound of your heart
The world sang along to it falling apart

[Chorus]
But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

[Verse 2]
I got the good side of life
Travelled the universe twice
So many thoughts I wanted to share
But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair
Then I got the good side of new
Found arms to fall right into
I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
And some day I hope that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

[Bridge]
I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
And catch up on everything
I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

[Chorus]
But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
Sympathize, recognize
Apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
