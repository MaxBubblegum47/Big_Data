[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Young ambition
Say we'll go slow, but we never do
Premonition
See me spendin’ every night with you

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Oh, yeah, under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite
And I wanna end up on you
Oh, don't need no place to go
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we’ve already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just
Dance to this
Dance to this
We can just dance to this

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Dear beloved
Bring those 501s a bit closer, bit closer
And dear, my lover
Do that thing we never do sober, sober

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan, 
Ariana Grande
 & 
Both
]
Oh, 
yeah
, 
under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite
And I wanna end up on you 
(Yeah)
Oh, 
we don't need no place to go
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do

[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Ariana Grande]
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we've already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just
Dance to this
Dance to this
We can just dance to this

[Bridge: Troye Sivan 
with Ariana Grande

I don't wanna sleep tonight-night-night-night-night
I just wanna take that ride
I don't wanna sleep tonight-night-night-night-night
I just wanna take that ride

[Chorus: Troye Sivan 
with Ariana Grande

We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we've
Already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just…
We can just dance to this
Don’t take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we’ve already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just
Dance to this

I just wanna take that ride
I don’t wanna sleep tonight-night-night-night-night
