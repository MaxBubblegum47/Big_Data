[Verse 1]
What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

[Verse 2]
What if, what if we start to drive?
What if, what if we close our eyes?
What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body; timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

[Chorus]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

[Outro]
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
My youth is yours
My youth is yours
