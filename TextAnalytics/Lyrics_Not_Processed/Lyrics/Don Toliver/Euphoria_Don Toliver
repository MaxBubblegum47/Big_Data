[Intro: Travis Scott]
Euphoria, I'm drownin’ in euphoria
Drownin' in euphoria, euphoria

[Verse 1: Kaash Paige]
Sleep alone by my phone all the time
Check my phone, already knowin' it’s dry
Fake friends and old hoes, they all bangin' my line
Tryna get the patience, but I have no time
Like a dead man walking
Try to speed time, 'cause I know you
Funny how they never care about the old you
I'ma blow up, that's what I'm 'posed to
After I blow up, act like I don't know you

[Chorus: Kaash Paige & Don Toliver]
Euphoria, I’m drownin’ in euphoria (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
Drownin' in euphoria, drownin’ in euphoria (Oh-oh-oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I pulled off, off the street (Pulled off, pulled off)
Took two down, help me bleed (Ooh)
Hate when I'm in that mode (In that mode)
I should pull up with the
That's too easy
Say somethin' to me, but I’m not good at reachin'
I tried that reason
Secret lust, leave alone, then come back on this side
We both half high
Euphoria, tell me right now if I can get high with you
Euphoria, ask me right now and I'll tell you all the truth

[Chorus: Kaash Paige, with Travis Scott, Don Toliver]
Euphoria, I'm drownin' in euphoria (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
Drownin' in euphoria, drownin' in euphoria (Oh-oh-oh, oh)

[Verse 3: Don Toliver]
Seems like I came in time (Seems like)
But I thought I could do better, babe
Think about you every day (Seems like)
Just like the diamond, you shine (Seems like)
Too many girls in other states
I wouldn't have told you anyway
I guess you had enough (Had enough)
I called you four times, I guess you mad or what? (Mad or)
And me bein' me, I guess I'm outspoken (Yeah)
I leave all these girls around my house heartbroken
Euphoria, tell me right now if I can get high for you
Euphoria, ask me right now, and I'll tell is all the truth

[Chorus: Kaash Paige]
Euphoria, I'm drownin' in euphoria
Drownin' in euphoria, euphoria

[Outro: Kaash Paige]
Euphoria
