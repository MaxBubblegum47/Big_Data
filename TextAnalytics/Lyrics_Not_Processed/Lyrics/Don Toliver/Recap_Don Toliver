[Intro: NAV, Don Toliver & André 3000]
Ooh (Shoot through your car door), ooh (Shout out to Cardo, yeah)
Ooh, ooh (Yeah)
Oh, oh (Yeah)

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
I'm like, "Damn, lil' shawty you stylish"
Too geeked up on the island
Cartier frames, you valid
I can't tell where your mind at, yeah
Baby might start a fire
Long as I get to burn with ya
Let me be your supplier
Long as I get to burn with ya
Took enough time to get your stripes, I seen you fall back
Took a lil' time to hold yourself, avoided contact
You outta line to think that I would never come back
Remember that time you gave me that head, I need a recap, yeah

[Verse: NAV]
Mm, had me a soul-snatcher, had a mouth like a water slide (Slide)
Pull up on me, baby girl, I need a reminder (Yeah)
Every time you fuck with me, yeah, you know it's gon' be a vibe (Vibe)
Got a pint comin' through and I'm not not goin' outside
I'm on that dirty road (Road)
Used to hit the block, was hot, but I can't no more
Fuckin' with a brown boy like me, girl, gotta stay on toes (Stay on toes)
Made some bags on quarantine, I ain't gotta do no shows (Ooh)
Why you checkin' up on me? (On me)
We both know I'm doin' fine
I know they hate on me (On me)
Fuck it, I never mind (Ooh)
She just call me, yeah (Brr), whenever she like (Yeah)
She know I'ma be up (I'm up) at whatever time (Yeah)

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
I'm like, "Damn, lil' shawty you stylish"
Too geeked up on the island
Cartier frames, you valid
I can't tell where your mind at, yeah
Baby might start a fire
Long as I get to burn with ya
Let me be your supplier
Long as I get to burn with ya
Took enough time to get your stripes, I seen you fall back
Took a lil' time to hold yourself, avoided contact
You outta line to think that I would never come back
Remember that time you gave me that head, I need a recap, yeah

[Outro: NAV & Don Toliver]
(Yeah) I wanna do somethin', oh, I'm goin' all night, oh
(Yeah) You keep callin' my name, you can't relax, no
(Yeah) I wanna do somethin', oh, I'm goin' all night, oh
(Yeah) You keep callin' my name, you can't relax, no
