[Chorus]
Bitch, don't steal my man
He's got a weakness for girls like you
We both know you can
But I really need him more than you

[Verse 1]
You're a supermodel, shaped just like a bottle
He could run his fingers through your hair
I bet you're a good time
But don't you know he's mine?
I was runnin' 'round for a minute
But he's the only one who can get it

[Chorus]
So bitch, don't steal my man
He's got a weakness for girls like you
We both know you can
But I really need him more than you

[Verse 2]
Maybe I can fake it
Fake it 'til you make it
I can't do that, I'm not normal
I can't praise, I'll be cordial
Got a mouth just like a trucker
I can't even be a lady
Out in public 
for my mother
, motherfucker

[Chorus]
But bitch, don't steal my man
He's got a weakness for girls like you
We both know you can
But I really need him more than you

[Bridge]
I won't blame him if he leaves me for you, oh
I won't even blame him if one day he runs off with you

[Chorus]
Bitch, don't steal my man
He's got a weakness for girls like you
We both know you can
But I really need him more than you
Yeah

[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
Don't steal my man
Bitch, don't steal my man
Don't steal my man
