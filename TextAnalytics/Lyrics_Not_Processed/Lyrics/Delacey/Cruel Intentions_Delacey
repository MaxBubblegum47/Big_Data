[Chorus: Delacey]
I like sex, I like flowers, I like attention
Don't ever put me second
I bet you won't find nothing feels this good this side of Heaven
So stop talking, pull my stockings down
You're my cruel intention
I bet you won't find nothing feels this good this side of, this side of, this side of Heaven

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Uh, think you got me, but the problem is
I'm already here but I see the play I just been watching this
Happy to see the way you call me everyday, its obvious
Plus it's 2AM you know what time it is
You just wanna have me come and chase you, boost your confidence
Shower you with flowers, give you all these daily compliments, yeah
Careful if you fall in love, then it's gon' be a consequence
We keep going it's no turning back, it ain't no stopping us
Had you at "I'm Gerald what's your name?"
Burning in a flame, a little fling you turn into a game
And since we started fucking, it's never been the same
The idea of stopping, I can't even entertain
You driving me insane, craziest I met
Drinking champagne, we started fucking on a jet
Took you to the Mile High, then we start to sweat
I got you in a bag but you still play hard to get, uh

[Chorus: Delacey]
I like sex, I like flowers, I like attention
Don't ever put me second
I bet you won't find nothing feels this good this side of Heaven
So stop talking, pull my stockings down
You're my cruel intention
I bet you won't find nothing feels this good this side of, this side of, this side of Heaven

[Post-Chorus]
This side of Heaven

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, when you over this is light work
Love that when you put them heel on, with that tight skirt
Sleeping over almost every night, wake up in my shirt
If we make it official, I think maybe this could might work
Fuck the heavy shit, tho' we livin' in this moment
It's not even mine but I treat it like I own it
Six missed calls, but ain't tripping, where your phone went?
Ain't thinkin' bout that now, nothing matters now, got you so wet
Light a couple candles in the room, pop some Moet
Every single night I'm tryna go where we ain't go yet
Finishes, she clinches like she ain't trying to go yet
Yeah, I mean you crazy and you know that
Yeah crazier than me, keep on playin' mind games
I ain't got time for that shit, it give me migraines
Only the realness, it's what's runnin' through my veins
And every time I'm in that, she always screamin' my name

[Chorus: Delacey]
I like sex, I like flowers, I like attention
Don't ever put me second
I bet you won't find nothing feels this good this side of Heaven
So stop talking, pull my stockings down
You're my cruel intention
I bet you won't find nothing feels this good this side of, this side of, this side of Heaven

[Outro: Delacey]
So let me take you there
You ain't seen this side of Heaven
This side of Heaven
This side of Heaven
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, woah
This side of Heaven
