[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
I can't really tell why there's hills on my skin
When you're whispering all your intentions
I don't really know why my heart skips a beat
When you get too close
Oh, it's almost

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Just like first love
You give everything and you give too much
Just like first love
You don't really care if it hurts a lot
When it's all done
You look back and know it was worth it all
Worth it all
We'll never forget how it feels now

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Just like first love
Just like first love
When it's all done
Just like first love

[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]
We're just making waves different shades of emotions
Fast and slow, hot and cold
We bring out the worst and the best in each other
But can't let go
Oh, it's almost

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Just like first love
You give everything and you give too much
Just like first love
You don't really care if it hurts a lot
When it's all done
You look back and know it was worth it all
Worth it all
We'll never forget how it feels now

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Just like first love
Just like first love
When it's all done
Just like first love
Just like first love
(I wanna give it, I wanna give it, I wanna)
Just like first love
(I'm gonna get there, I'm gonna get there, I'm gonna)
When it's all done
(I wanna give it, I wanna give it, I wanna)
Just like first love
(I'm gonna give it, I'm gonna give it, I'm gonna)

[Bridge: Sabrina Carpenter]
I can't really tell
Why there's hills on my skin
When you get too close
Oh, it's almost

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Just like first love
You give everything and you give too much
Just like first love
You don't really care if it hurts a lot
When it's all done
You look back and know it was worth it all
Worth it all
We'll never forget how it feels now

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Just like first love
(I wanna get there, I wanna get there, I wanna-)
Just like first love
(I'm gonna get there, I'm gonna get there, I gonna-)
When it's all done
(I wanna get there, I wanna get there, I wanna-)
Just like first love
(I'm gonna get there, I'm gonna get there, I gonna-)
Just like first love
