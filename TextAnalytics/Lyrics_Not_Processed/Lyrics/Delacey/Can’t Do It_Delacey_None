[Verse 1: Loren Gray]
Let's not be so cavalier about it
We both know that we can't go without it
Hear your voice the way it always sounded
Hits me in the center, yeah
I feel like we're alone, but we're surrounded
You should feel my heart right now, it's pounding
For you, you know it always beats the loudest
I want this forever, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Loren Gray]
When you find something like this, you don't let go
You've always been the one, and now I know

[Chorus: Loren Gray]
I don't wanna miss you again
I can't do it, can't do it
It's no accident that we're here
No one's loving you like I can
They can't do it, can't do it
Don't you dare go and disappear
I don't wanna miss you again

[Verse 2: Loren Gray]
Can't believe we almost didn't make it
Your name on my mirror never faded
I saw you in everybody's faces
It was heartbreaking, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Loren Gray]
When you find something like this, you don't let go
You've always been the one and now I know

[Chorus: Loren Gray]
I don't wanna miss you again
I can't do it, can't do it
It's no accident that we're here
No one's loving you like I can
They can't do it, can't do it
Don't you dare go and disappear
I don't wanna miss you again

[Verse 3: Saweetie]
Uh-oh, Saweetie
Off top, got my man on lock
VVS Flintstones, make the bed rock
Work all week so the bands don't stop
And when shit pop off, need a man like Pac
Who's she? That's me, that's icy
Who's he? OG, I'm wifey
Yeah, said he down for the life
I run a check up and he run red lights
I'm high tonight
Said I don't bite, but a bitch just might
I like real ice, rich boy toy
Yeah, he just my type

[Bridge: Loren Gray]
Did you miss me while you're gone?
Was it worth it, baby?
(Miss me while you're gone)
(Did you miss me while you're gone?)
And were you still hanging on
To the love we were making?
(Miss me while you're gone)
Oh

[Chorus: Loren Gray]
I don't wanna miss you again
I can't do it, can't do it
It's no accident that we're here
No one's loving you like I can
They can't do it, can't do it
Don't you dare go and disappear
I don't wanna miss you again

[Outro: Loren Gray]
Oh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna miss you again, again, again
I don't wanna miss you again
I don't wanna miss you
