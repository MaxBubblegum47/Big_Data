[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Verse]
I can't believe that, you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you, ooh
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you, ooh

[Bridge]
It's gon' be hard here on my own
And even harder to let you go, I
Really wish that we, could have got this right

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone (Oh)

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you (No, no, no)
