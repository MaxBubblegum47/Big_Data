[Intro: The Kid LAROI]

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I know that we ain't gettin' along (Nah, nah, nah)
But I don't wanna see you on your own tonight
Girl, DND your phone (Do that shit)
I'm tryna get you on your own tonight
You're bad and you know it (You do)
You tell me that you're with it, gotta show me now (Oh)
Mixing Hennessy with emotions (Emotions)
I'm tryna let go, can you hold me down?

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
You got it, you got it, girl, and you know that shit
You tell me you want the world, can't give you all that shit
Let's get out the Hennessy, let me pour that shit
I'm tryna make memories, give me all that shit
Let's make some, shawty, take drugs 'til the sun come up
In the Wraith truck, give me brain, uh, give me all that, uh
Give me all that, do it how you want it (Oh)
Don't even gotta ask 'cause you bad and you know it (You do)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I know that we ain't gettin' along (We don't)
But I don't wanna see you on your own tonight
Girl, DND your phone (Do that shit)
I'm tryna get you on your own tonight
You're bad and you know it (Oh, oh)
You tell me that you're with it, gotta show me now (Gotta show me)
Mixing Hennessy with emotions
I'm tryna let go, can you hold me down?

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
She wanna be my one and only
But I can't be the one she wantin'
Baby, I'm sorry, sorry, I don't care
Baby, I'm sorry, sorry, I won't be
Don't give a fuck, let's get drunk and then fuck
Fucked up, I just wanna feel love
I'm gon' face one to feel some 'cause she takes some
Well, I don't got time to wait on you

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I know that we ain't gettin' along
But I don't wanna see you on your own tonight
Girl, DND your phone (Ooh, ooh)
I'm tryna get you on your own tonight
You're bad and you know it (You do)
You tell me that you're with it, gotta show me now
Mixing Hennessy with emotions (Oh, oh)
I'm tryna let go, can you hold me down?

[Verse 3: Lil Mosey]
I said, "Baby, you better show me" (Baby)
Tired of these hoes, feel like the old me (Oh)
I remember the last thing you told me (Told me)
I know you fuck with everybody, so I might move doli (Lil' bitch)
Back on my old shit (Old shit), put shit in motion (Oh)
Pussy so wet, it feel like a ocean (Oh yeah)
You can't play with me, yeah, act like I don't know this (Wow)
Bitches changed and act like I ain't notice, oh (Bitches changed)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI, The Kid LAROI & Lil Mosey]
I know that we ain't gettin' along
But I don't wanna see you on your own tonight
Girl, DND your phone
I'm tryna get you on your own tonight
You're bad and you know it
You tell me that you're with it, gotta show me now
Mixing Hennessy with emotions
I'm tryna let go, can you hold me down?
