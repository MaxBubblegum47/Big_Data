[Verse 1]
I've been doing my own thing
Always, always had a way
Of having bad timing
But to my great surprise
Ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you

[Chorus]
Tell me if you want me to
Give you all my time
I want to make it good for you
'Cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true
You're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me if you want me to

[Verse 2]
If you thought I'd sleep on this
Oh you're wrong 'cause all I dream about is our first kiss
And you are the first one to make me feel like this
And this is one opportunity that I can't resist, no, no
Boy, you wanna know the deal
You are wondering if the words I'm saying are for real
'Cause you got more appeal
Than any man in this whole world
And baby, I gotta know how you feel, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me if you want me to
Give you all my time
I'm gonna make it good for you
'Cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true
You're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me if you want me to, yeah

[Bridge]
Tell me if you want to
I can make it good for you
Tell me, tell me, baby
Tell me if you want to
I can make it good for you
So tell me, tell me, oh
Can you tell me?

[Chorus]
Tell me if you want me to
Give you all my time
I'm gonna make it good for you
'Cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true
You're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to
