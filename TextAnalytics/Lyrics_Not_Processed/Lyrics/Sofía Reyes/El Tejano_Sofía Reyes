[Intro: Sofía Reyes & 
Lauv
]
Y primero dije "no," pero sí quería (
Woo
)
Pa' que te fueras me inventé cualquier tontería (Hmm-hmm)
Pero después del trago cinco te di la mano, y (
Woo
)
Me gustó tanto lo malo que eras bailando (
Okay
)

[Chorus: Lauv 
with Sofía Reyes
]
I met a girl at El Tejano, 
we danced
To Spanish covers of Nirvana, 
we danced
And got another margarita, she's from Reseda
I said, "I'm from wherever you're goin' tonight," yeah

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Drinkin' after dark, that's when she stole my heart (Mmm)
She knew my friends, that's where the story begins
Standin' at the salsa bar, asked if it was mild
I was speechless, but still, I smiled
Took me by the hand and asked me if I had plans
I said, "Gettin' drunk and pretendin' that I can dance"
She laughed, I fell in love and now it's no goin' back
Once you know it, yeah, you know it, that's that

[Chorus: Lauv 
with Sofía Reyes
]
I met a girl at El Tejano, 
we danced
To Spanish covers of Nirvana, 
we danced
And got another margarita, she's from Reseda
I said, "I'm from wherever you're goin' tonight," yeah
It's happy hour up in NoHo, 
we danced
She said, "I never come here solo," 
we danced
She's got a round of straight tequila, she's from Reseda
I said, "I'm from wherever you're goin' tonight," yeah

[Verse 2: Lauv & 
Sofía Reyes
]
She asked if I like 
Friends
, I guess that that was the test
I said, "Hell yeah, and Phoebe's the fuckin' best"
We were standin' at the salsa bar, feelin' the vibration (
I know
)
I always find myself in random situations
Ooh, do you wanna have a little bit of fun tonight?
She said, "Ooh, I do"
Ooh, do you wanna have a little bit of fun?
Once you know it, yeah, you know it, that's that

[Chorus: Lauv 
with Sofía Reyes
]
I met a girl at El Tejano, 
we danced
To Spanish covers of Nirvana, 
we danced
And got another margarita, she's from Reseda
I said, "I'm from wherever you're goin' tonight"
It's happy hour up in NoHo, 
we danced
She said, 
"I never come here solo," we danced
She's got a round of straight tequila, she's from Reseda
I said, "I'm from 
wherever you're goin' tonight"

[Verse 3: Sofía Reyes]
Y primero dije "no," pero sí quería
Pa' que te fueras me inventé cualquier tontería
Pero después del trago cinco te di la mano, y
Me gustó tanto lo malo que eras bailando
Déjame, te enseño yo, que la cumbia es mía
Cuando se acabe esta canción, nos vamos, ¿quién diría no?
Mira que no salgo sola, pero llego sola
Que estoy mejor sola, pero
We're going to my place tonight

[Outro: Lauv]
I met a girl at El Tejano, we danced (I'm from wherever you're goin')
To Spanish covers of Nirvana, we danced (I'm from wherever you're goin')
And got another margarita, she's from Reseda (I'm from wherever you're goin')
I said, "I'm from wherever you're goin' tonight"
