[Verse 1]
Oh, thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free

[Verse 2]
Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more

[Chorus]
And baby, you're all that I want
When you lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
We're in heaven

[Verse 3]
Oh, once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down

[Verse 4]
Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh there's a lot that I could say
But just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way

[Chorus]
And baby, you're all that I want
When you lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
We're in heaven

[Outro]
And baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
We're in heaven
We're in heaven
