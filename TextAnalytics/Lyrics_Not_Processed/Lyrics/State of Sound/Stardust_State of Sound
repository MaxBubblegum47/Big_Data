[Verse 1]
Twinkle, twinkle superstar
Show me who you really are
Let me in under your skin
Wanna see what lies within
See you classing through the crowd
Everybody watching 'cause you're in the clouds
And you're so untouchable, you fly so high
Wanna take you down, 'cause you taking me down
Stepping up my game, I'll try to lock your eyes
Wanna get to know you but you're cold as ice
Yeah, you're cold as ice, wanna open your mind

[Chorus]
You gotta let yourself go with me
Then you can be who you wanna be
I feel you carry my destiny
Don't you know that you can't run from the chemistry?
So come on, light up a light in me
Then just let all your love run free
You gotta open up us with the stardust

[Post-Chorus]
Open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust

[Verse 2]
Melt the ice and start the fire
Let it loose, what's shut inside
Shine a light and lead the way
Break the chain and walk away
I can't see what's on your mind
Laying here together gonna work this time
We can run away, I'll never let you down
Let it go, see the fire igniting your eyes
Just gotta relax, let me take off your mask
You don't have to worry 'cause I got your back
And you never go back, I can promise you that

[Chorus]
You gotta let yourself go with me
Then you can be who you wanna be
I feel you carry my destiny
Don't you know that you can't run from the chemistry?
So come on, light up a light in me
Then just let all your love run free
You gotta open up us with the stardust

[Post-Chorus]
Open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust

[Bridge]
Twinkle, twinkle superstar
Everybody wanna be right where you are
And you're so untouchable, you fly so high
Wanna take you down, 'cause you're taking me down
Stepping up my game, I'll try to lock your eyes
Wanna get to know you but you're cold as ice
Why you're cold as ice when I'm feeling your fire?

[Chorus]
You gotta let yourself go with me
Then you can be who you wanna be
I feel you carry my destiny
Don't you know that you can't run from the chemistry?
So come on, light up a light in me
Then just let all your love run free
You gotta open up us with the stardust

[Post-Chorus]
Open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust

[Outro]
You gotta open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust
You gotta open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust
Open up us with the stardust
