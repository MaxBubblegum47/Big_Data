[Verse 1]
Didn't know that the grass could be green like you
Didn't see, I was falling so fast into
On the brink of giving up
Like I balance on the edge of my mind
And I wanna let it go and give into what I can't deny

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're breaking me down
And I can't get you around
I can feel it is knocking me over inside
Redefining my life in a blink of an eye
I would give it all up if you stay with me now

[Chorus]
I'm high on you
High on you
I'm high on you
High on you

[Verse 2]
Like I'm losing my mind I can't sleep at night
Can't hold back and you know, know what left you hide
Million voices in my head tell me, "Listen to yourself and go"
And I'm fighting it within but I'm slowly giving up control

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're breaking me down
And I can't get you around
I can feel it is knocking me over inside
Redefining my life in a blink of an eye
I would give it all up if you stay with me now

[Chorus]
I'm high on you
High on you
I'm high on you
High on you

[Bridge]
High on you
High on you
If it's all in my mind
I'm never coming down
I just wanna stay up in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're breaking me down
And I can't get you around
I can feel it is knocking me over inside
Redefining my life in a blink of an eye
I would give it all up if you stay with me now

[Chorus]
I'm high on you
High on you
I'm high on you
High on you

[Outro]
I'm high on you
High on you
I'm high on you
High on you
