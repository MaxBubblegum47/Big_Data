Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, I put my make up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long

[Pre-Chorus: Sia (Sean Paul)]
Till I hit the dance floor (Bada bang)
Hit the dance floor (Bada bang)

No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you baby
(Just you an me)

[Chorus: Sia & 
Sean Paul
]
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills!)
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight

You worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus tek control
I don't need no money
You worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outa control

Till I hit the dance floor (Bada bang)
Hit the dance floor (Bada bang)
