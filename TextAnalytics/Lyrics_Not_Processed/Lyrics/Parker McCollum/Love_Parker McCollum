(Koe Wetzel)
To say I have been missing you
Is the worst thing possible I could ever do
And to sleep one more night next to you
Should be out of the question
Don't ask me no question like
If I love you because I don't
I don't love you, selfish don't love nobody
I can't love you like you should be loved
(Koe Wetzel)
Don't talk crazy and killing your self won't change a god damn thing If it's help that you need, I know a place down the street
And the storm is moving in, it's been raining for five full days
And I know now is not the best time but I just got to say, I don't I don't I don't love you
Selfish don't love nobody
I can't love you, like you should be loved
(Parker McCollum)
Was it an accident?
When a broken heart and a bullet mark is all that she left
To ask if I give a damn, should be out of the question
Don't ask me no question 'cause
I don't love you
(Koe Wetzel)
Selfish don't love nobody
And I can't love you
Like you should be loved
I don't love you, selfish don't love nobody
