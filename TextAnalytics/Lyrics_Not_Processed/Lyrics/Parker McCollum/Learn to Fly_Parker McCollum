[Verse 1]
To left to me a striped fence
To me, this does not make sense
What's two when all you need is one
Who's to blame for the empty gun
If all tears from the sky
Why do they fall from your eyes
Leave a sparkle that's you see in dreams
What's to come when the grass don't turn green

[Chorus]
It's runnin' fast
Cannot slow
Sit and wonderin' where I'll go
Drift in head and lazy eyes
Hold me momma as I learn to fly

[Verse 2]
And if it tastes too good
It could be a lie
You ain't the apple of your momma's eye
Who needs a moon for a light
Flip a switch and we're back to life
Now what's in the air
Who's on the street
Who's the pretty girl glaring at me
Why's the sun shinin' off her hair
Why now do I seem to care

[Chorus]
It's runnin' fast
Cannot slow
Sit and wonderin' where I'll go
Drift in head and lazy eyes
Hold me momma as I learn to fly

[Verse 3]
Now shake a left or take a right
Hope that there's no one left in sight
Do shadows really dance and gleam
They all look pretty damn dark to me
And times the only thing I'd say we are in
While we are fightin' till the bitter end
Cashin' in everything we know
Dâ€‹oes dying rich determine where we go

[Chorus]
It's runnin' fast
Cannot slow
Sit and wonderin' where I'll go
Drift in head and lazy eyes
Hold me momma as I learn to fly

[Chorus]
It's runnin' fast
Cannot slow
Sit and wonderin' where I'll go
Drift in head and lazy eyes
Hold me momma as I learn to fly
