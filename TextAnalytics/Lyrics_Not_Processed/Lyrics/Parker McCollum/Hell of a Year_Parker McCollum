[Verse 1]
Its been a hell of a year
How did you see
Who I was ain't who I was gonna be
I could've been right
Was probably wrong
So many nights wishin' I could go home
It's been a hell of a year
It's been a hell of a year

[Verse 2]
Now my heart's out of love
I fell out of line
I swore that I'd never leave again and I lied
It was the weight of the world
You settin' me free
You can't sleep alone and you ain't sleepin' with me
Its been a hell of a year
Its been a hell of a year

[Verse 3]
You hate how I live
Go up to come down
I smoke you away and then you drink â€˜til you drown
I wasn't meant to be then
It ain't meant to be now
I love this home but now I hate this house
It's been a hell of a year
It's been a hell of a year

[Verse 4]
It's been a hell of a year
How did you see
That who I was ain't who I was gonna be
I could've been right
Was probably wrong
So many nights wishin' I could go home
It's been a hell of a year
It's been a hell of a year
