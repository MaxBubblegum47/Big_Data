[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, (Uh, uh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, now

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets, roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins, I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems, fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious, they nuttin' to me though, I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights, talk too much, the wrong advice, all the lights
And call my life, doctor, doctor, will you help me? Get me healthy, keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now, fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch, you jealous now, 
smokin' weed at the crib watching 
Belly
 now
 (Alright)
All the pain that they causin' like, fuck it, we ballin', now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling, I'm chilling, just living, I'm burning away
Conversations we having, I'm getting too static, too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break

[Chorus: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (Yeah)
Everything good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
Everything will be good by the weekend (By the weekend)

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I been having trouble sleeping, battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing: is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent, all the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent, 
what do it mean to be a G?
 Yeah (Alright)
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
She ain't God as I, I make water wine, pausin' time, 
it's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's
, 
wondering, well
Wonderin' how I got this high, fell asleep and forgot to die, Goddamn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browser, like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what the day is

[Chorus: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (Yeah)
Everything good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
Everything will be good by the weekend (By the weekend)

[Outro: Miguel]
Mondays I think of you, but I ain’t tripping on it
Tuesdays I’m hittin', gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit wit'chu, you know you're staying over
Thursdays I’m sick of you, I got to get rid of you
'Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of
My life, alright
When I get faded you hate it, but, baby
It’s gon' be alright
Haha, alright
