[Intro]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments in vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Verse 1]
We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
Peach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens
As we laugh over shotguns and tongue kisses
Bubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather
A cold flame, the thrill of no shame
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Chorus]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, baptism
Peach colored skies we feel the sunrise
Two lost angels discover salvation
Don't you wish we could run away now?
Yes, let's
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Chorus]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Partial Pre-Chorus]
Wordplay, turns into gun play
 
(Yeah baby, when we face the sun)
And gun play turns into pillow talk
 (You'll know for sure)
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
 (That I'm all yours)
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning
 (All yours darling)

[Chorus]
Coffee in the morning
 (Woman, do you know what you've done to me baby?)
I don't wanna wake you
 (Stay darling)
I just wanna watch you sleep
 (Stay darling, yeah)
It's the smell of your hair
 (No, babe)
And it's the way that we feel
 (Never know how it feels)
I've never felt comfortable
 (Feel like this, woman)

[Chorus]
Turns into coffee in the morning
 (You'll never be the end)
Coffee in the morning
 (
You'll
 
never
 be the end of me)
I don't wanna wake you
 (You'll never be the end of me, darling)
I just wanna watch you sleep
 (Yeah baby, be the end of me, baby)
It's the smell of your hair
 (No, babe)
And it's the way that we feel
 (Never felt like this, woman)
I've never felt comfortable like this
 (Feel like this, darling, no)

[Outro: Miguel]
All right, old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Two lost angels discover salvation
Under glass pink skies watching the sunlight
(Fucking in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
(Fucking in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
(Fucking in the morning)
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
(Fucking in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
