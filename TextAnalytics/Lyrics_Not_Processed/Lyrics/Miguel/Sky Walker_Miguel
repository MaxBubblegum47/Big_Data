[Intro: Miguel]
Quick to dead the bull like a matador
Quick to dead the bull like a matador
Bull, bull, bull like a matador
Quick to dead the bull like a matador

[Chorus: Miguel]
Cap and a stem, catch a wave on us (splish)
Take a shot, make a friend, just enjoy the moment
I'm Luke Skywalkin' on these haters (splish)
Celebrate every day like a birthday
Good things come to those that wait up (splish)
But don't wait to jump in too long
Don't sleep, you gotta stay up (splish)
Don't, don't sleep, you gotta stay up
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Miguel]
I'm outstandin' so I stand out (stand out)
Got more babes than a bathhouse
Top Gun, on my Tom Cruise
I play for keeps and I don't lose
You're gonna love it 'cause you're cool as a breeze (cool as a breeze)
So pick a poison, yeah I got what you need (got what you need)
Nonchalant got the green on rotation all night
We gon' keep it psychedelic like a...

Cap and a stem, catch a wave on us (splish)
Take a shot, make a friend, just enjoy the moment
I'm Luke Skywalkin' on these haters (splish)
Celebrate every day like a birthday
Good things come to those that wait up (splish)
But don't wait to jump in too long
Don't sleep, you gotta stay up (splish)
Don't, don't sleep, you gotta stay up
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Wildin' on my haters (yah)
In my 23s, havin' a Jordan moment
Wildin' with the paper (it's lit)
Ice all on my chain, I'ma...
I just popped two, I'll be stayin' up (yeah, yeah)
Hangin' with the gang, that shit dangerous, yeah
I can't fuck you with my chains, that shit tangle up, yeah
Come and catch a wave, take one out my cup, yeah
Damn near OD'd (OD'd)
Damn the police, woah (hey)
Wildin' in SV, yeah (hey)
Movin' up your street, yeah (straight up)
When we on the creek
And bring sand to the beach (alright)
Ain't no day, ain't no night
Made no plans, ain't no sleep
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Miguel]
Cap and a stem, catch a wave on us (splish)

[Bridge: Miguel]
I was good then, but I'm better now (hey)
All gains I've been reppin' up (hey)
Quick to dead the bull like a matador (hey)
Right now I'm higher up than Canada (hey)

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Miguel]
Oooh, I
Got the baes lookin' at me like it's dinnertime
I know she vegan, but she want the steak tonight, yeah
And I smile like a saint with a sinner's mind
Baby roll it, lick it, love it, daddy blow your mind
Shotgunnin', takin' shots now
Conversation flowin'
Left off, we in the clouds now
Laughin' in the moments
First you put the work in 'til it works out
Work it out 'til it's turnt out, yeah
Oooh, I
