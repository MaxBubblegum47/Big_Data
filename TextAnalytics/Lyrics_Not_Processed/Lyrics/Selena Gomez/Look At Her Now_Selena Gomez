[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down

[Pre-Chorus]
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

[Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now

[Post-Chorus]
Wow, look at her now

[Verse 2]
Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment
Like that night
Wasn't wrong, wasn't right, yeah
What a thing to be human (What a thing to be human)
Made her more of a woman (Made her more of a woman)

[Pre-Chorus]
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

[Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now (Look at her now)
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah)
Wow, look at her now (Look at her now)
(Look at her now)
Wow, look at her now

[Bridge]
She knows she'll find love (She knows)
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love (She knows)
She knows she'll find love (She knows)
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love (She knows)
On the up from the way down
Look at her now, watch her go

[Outro]
Mm-mm, look at her now, mm-mm (Oh)
She knows she'll find love (She knows she will)
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
Look at her now, yeah (Look at her now)
She knows she'll find love (She knows she will)
Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
Wow, look at her now
