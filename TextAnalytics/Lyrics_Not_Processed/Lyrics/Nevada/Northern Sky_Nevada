[Hook: Jon White]
I'm following the only light in the northern sky
Give all that I got just to be alive
If you feel the same, put 'em up real high
The party don't stop, we celebratin' this life
Cause one day the city will turn into dust
So until that day comes, I'll be lifting You up
You're the only light that won't ever die
All the way up, way up in the northern sky

[Verse 1: Cole Walowac]
Yeah, the boy devoted
The coldest and you know it
Been at it for a while so don't ask me where I'm goin'
I'm the type that's just gon' show it
Out here in the moment
So if you down with that, pack your bags, let's keep it coastin'
I'm just livin' life to the fullest, not many can say that they do this
Traveled 'round the world and back, yeah, that's a fact
Don't believe me, you snoozin'
Set free, yeah, I'm gone, so I guess this is goodbye
Only one place that I'm headed
Straight up through the northern sky

[Breakdown: Jon White]
Way up in the northern sky

[Hook: Jon White]
I'm following the only light in the northern sky
Give all that I got just to be alive
If you feel the same, put 'em up real high
The party don't stop, we celebratin' this life
Cuz one day the city will turn into dust
So until that day comes, I'll be lifting You up
You're the only light that won't ever die
All the way up, way up in the northern sky

[Verse 2: KB & Jon White]
Oh it's obvious that I'm confident
Raybans and my moccasins
Mockin' my prerogatives
And Imma still roll out, no marketing
Pull up in the Mazda 6
Tell 'em, "I'm parkin' here!"
Pardon the art, know it's hard to chill
Now I'm turnin' the whole park into Parkinsons, cause it's shakin'
Aight, you ain't gotta "ok" it
You ain't really gotta go say it
You ain't really gotta go crazy, you crazy
We all over the country (country)
That's so Paisley
Imago Dei this place
Ok, ok, boy, let me stop playin'
Everybody better run it right now
Run it right now, cause He's comin' back now
If you runnin' yo mouth, better Ã¡ndale
Come to face God cause He runnin' this house
So devout, boy, you know gon' shout
Not doubt we are proud and never back down
Lay it down to the cross, get a crown
From the lost to the found
Get lost in the (northern sky)

One life so we live it up
