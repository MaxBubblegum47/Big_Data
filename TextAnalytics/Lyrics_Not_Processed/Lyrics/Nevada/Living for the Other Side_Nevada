Hit up the crew then I lace up my Nikes
I jam on the radio just to start it off right
Let's make this night incredible
Somethin' unforgettable
We're gonna have a real good time
Put in sixty hours this week workin' overtime
So there's no way that I'm gonna stay in tonight
Oh, no, we never stop 'cause we rock around the clock
We're gonna have a real good time

Some say we're kinda crazy
I think I'd have to agree
But that's the only way I wanna be

Every moment's like a theme park ride
There's no way we'll let it pass us by
Don't have to sleep
We'll have the stars in the sky
We see the future
We're livin' for the other side
Every second's at the speed of sound
There's not a chance that we about to slow down
Some people say that we are out of our minds
We know the future
We're livin' for the other side

Royal Tailor
Yeah, show 'em what you got, Tauren

We've only just begun
You ask if this is real
We're goin' hard
Reachin' for tomorrow
You wanna know how it feels
Yeah, tell 'em how it feels

It's unbelievable
Can't stop us now
Yeah, we've lost control
Turn up the volume
So it hits the soul
You know we got that crazy flow
Pump it through your stereo
CK and Royal Tailor
Seekin' our creator

Some say we're kinda crazy
I think I'd have to agree
'Cause that's the only way I wanna be

Every moment's like a theme park ride
There's no way we'll let it pass us by
Don't have to sleep
We'll have the stars in the sky
We see the future
We're livin' for the other side
Every second's at the speed of sound
There's not a chance that we about to slow down
Some people say that we are out of our minds
We know the future
We're livin' for the other side
