[Verse 1: Mark Morrison]
Well, I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flo'
Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And to show you that I'm with

[Pre-Hook: Mark Morrison & Fetty Wap]
You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Oh my god baby
Dare I ask

[Hook: Mark Morrison & Fetty Wap]
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back
Return of the Mack

[Verse 2: Mark Morrison]
So, I'm back up in the game (hustling sound)
Running things to keep my swing (whole night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (oh oh oh)
So baby listen carefully while I sing my comeback song
Squah!

[Pre-Hook: Mark Morrison & Fetty Wap]
You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Oh my god baby
Dare I ask
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
Return of the Mack, there it is
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, here I go

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Cause the money ain't enough
I remember when it was
I had dreams of being up
I ain't never leave you stuck (oh my god)
And you say you will never turn on me, baby, aye
You played me like a tournament, baby, aye
You know I gave you the best of me, baby
Oh man, I thought you were next to me, baby
I guess I gotta show you I am the one that you were with
That got you swerving in the whip
And putting diamonds on your wrists, baby
Still making hit after hit, baby
I bet you'll let me hit after this

[Pre-Hook: Mark Morrison]
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
Return of the Mack, yea
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, here I go
