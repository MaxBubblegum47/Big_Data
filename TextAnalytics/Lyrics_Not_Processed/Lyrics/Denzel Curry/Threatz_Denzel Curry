Nigga Klan be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
Nigga we don't take kindly to threats
Bitch S.S. be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
We don't take kindly to threats
Nigga Klan be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
We don't take kindly to threats
Bitch S.S. be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
Nah we don't take kindly to threats

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Slide for the free, kill for the fee
Pull out the stick then I pull out the ski
Put a motherfucker face on a white tee
That's what a nigga get being P.I.E
Sweet, nigga you D.I.E
Sleep,
 
motherfucker that's six feet
Deep,
 
no tender, no love, no care
But a nigga here still gon' creep
T.L.C. put it to ya Lisa Lo' that's a nigga left
Eye, kill a nigga, get ghost, that
Patrick Swayze,
 
come equipped with a vest
I'mma point that shit to your motherfucking neck
K's all in my trunk
, 
so you best to get a chopper
It's nothing but goon action, I ain't talking Waka Flocka
That 2.7.5. goons bout' to do a fucking gank
Bumping Waka Flocka Flame in a underwater tank
Cause nigga die right now, bullet or a fucking shank
Niggas always tryna' be the hardest in the fucking paint

[Verse 2: Yung Simmie]
Never take kind to the threats
I be off for your neck 'for you reach for the TEC, Simmie
Niggas gon' hear me then fear me, feel me?
Whole bunch of green in my Philly,
 turn up
Whole bunch of niggas if you run up
Tryna' act hard with your gun up, I shoot your son up
Grinding till the sun up, middle finger flashed
That's a one up, I'm a young gutta
Dog I mutter,
 Curry said cut ‘em with his brudda
Leave them boys wet like water
Off with his neck, posted with the set
I don't take kindly to threats, take kindly to threats
Ratchet for life, I'm hood, tryna' smoke bad but I’m good
Bust a nigga head for the cake
Jumping over gates can't wait
Nine to the face, fuck nigga you ain't safe

[Verse 3: Robb Bank$]
Savage life, nigga, you don't wanna see me live
Pop more than a quarter, so tell that dime piece
"Bitch, don't kill my vibe", man
I know your bitch love me, I know your bitch want me
She let me pillow pet that kitty when she climb under this Snuggie
Bitch, South Florida, I only smoke mid in Broward
But end the flame of that Magic Dragon and kill that Charmander, bitch
Gone on you niggas, 
two phones on you niggas
Think I made it?
 You don't wanna see me ball on you niggas, bitch
