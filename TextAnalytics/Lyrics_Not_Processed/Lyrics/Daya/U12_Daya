[Verse 1]
Got sixteen candles, make a wish and blow them out
Hoping for those three words, you never say out loud
I know you play cool but I know you think about it
So make my wish come true, and do something about it

[Chorus]
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I know I want to
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I hope you want to too
(Too-o-o, too-o-o,  too-o-o)

[Verse 2]
I don't know why they say young hearts are such a mystery
Feels like this thing we've got is part of ancient history
The way you look at me, kiss me, is so classic
So let the haters do their thing 'til they get past it

[Chorus]
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I know I want to
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I hope you want to too

[Bridge]
Three, four, five, six
Boy, you're my lucky seven
And I'm your ten, you're taking me to heaven
Three, four, five, six
Boy, you're my lucky seven
And I'm your ten, you're taking me to heaven

[Chorus]
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I know I want to
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I hope you want to too
(Too-o-o, too-o-o,  too-o-o)

[Outro]
Hope you want to too
(Too-o-o, too-o-o,  too-o-o)
Hope you want to too
(Too-o-o, too-o-o,  too-o-o)
Hope you want to too
(Too-o-o, too-o-o,  too-o-o)
Hope you want to
