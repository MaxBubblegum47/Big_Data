[Verse 1]
I remember the rush
We were running, backyard to yard
Wasn't scared of going too far
Staying out till it was too dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Now daylight don't make it right
And you would really know this
Closed hearts make closed minds
I won't tell you it's all butterflies and roses
When I back in time

[Chorus]
When we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
There's not much comfort in this place
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha I'll keep you safe
When you can't fight the bitter taste
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha I'll keep you safe

[Verse 2]
Don't remember it all
But I know that I was invincible
Like the heroes in the cartoons
Saving lives through my living room

[Pre-Chorus]
Now daylight don't make it right
And you would really know this
Closed hearts make closed minds
I won't tell you it's all butterflies and roses
When I back in time

[Chorus]
When we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
There's not much comfort in this place
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha I'll keep you safe
When you can't fight the bitter taste
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha I'll keep you safe

[Bridge]
I know that I'm a fighter
Yeah, I've always been a fighter
But I tried to play with fire, and I got burned
Don't know how to help this
Yeah, I'm feeling kind of helpless
Yeah, maybe it's too selfish if it don't wanna hurt

I know that I'm a fighter
Yeah, always been a fighter
But I tried to play with fire and I got burned
Don't know how to help this
Yeah, I'm feelin' kinda of helpless
Yeah, maybe you so selfish if it don't wanna hurt

I know that I’m a fighter, yeah I’ve always been a fighter
But I tried to play with fire, and I got burned
Don’t know how to help this, yeah I’m feelin’ kinda helpless
Yeah maybe its too selfish if I don’t wanna hurt

[Alternate Chorus]
There's not much comfort in this place
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha I'll keep you safe

When you can't fight the bitter taste
Ah-aha-aha-aha-aha I'll keep you safe
Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
Back then when we were ah-aha-aha-aha-aha safe
