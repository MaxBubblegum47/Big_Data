[Verse 1]
Could dress up, to get love
But guess what?
I'm never gonna be that girl
Who's living in a Barbie world
Could wake up in make up and play dumb
Pretending that I need a boy
Who's gonna treat me like a toy

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know the other girlies wanna wear expensive things like diamond rings
But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king

[Chorus]
Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

[Verse 2]
Mr. Right could be nice, for one night
But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo
That Snow White, she did right in her life
Had 7 men to do the chores
'Cause that's not what a lady's for

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The only thing a boy's gonna give a girl for free's captivity
And I might love me some vanilla, but I'm not that sugar sweet
Call me HBIC

[Chorus]
Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

[Bridge]
Sure, I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world
But they say pretty hurts
And I don't wanna sit still
I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world
But no, I won't sit still, look pretty
Sure, I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world
But they say pretty hurts
And I don't wanna sit still
I'm-I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world
But no, I won't sit still, look pretty

[Chorus]
Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
'Cause I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

[Outro]
Sit still, look pretty
Sit still, look pretty
Sit still, look pretty
Sit still, look pretty
