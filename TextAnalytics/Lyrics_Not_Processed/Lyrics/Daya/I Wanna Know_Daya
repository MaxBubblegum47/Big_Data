[Verse 1: Daya]
There's a light on your skin, painted gold on your feet
If you're gonna lean into me, make sure you feel the heat
You can take what you want, but when you take it from me
I'll make sure that you fall upon the floor down to your knees

[Pre-Chorus: Daya]
I'm not betting on a miracle to give me peace
I'm not asking for a miracle, just you and me (Hey!)

[Chorus: Daya]
Yeah, I wanna know if you're gonna be there
'Cause it's hard to believe or see it, yeah yeah
Why do I get the feeling?
We're getting close, but we'll never be there
'Cause it's hard to believe or see it, yeah yeah
Is it more than a feeling?

[Post-Chorus: Daya]
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know if you're gonna be there
'Cause it's hard to believe or see it, yeah yeah
Why do I get the feeling?
I wanna know

[Verse 2: Daya]
'Cause it's never a no, so what hand will you play?
Is it too much to ask if I should go, or I should stay?
In a moment of doubt, put your hand on the flame
When you need to remind yourself that you could feel the same

[Pre-Chorus: Daya]
I'm not betting on a miracle to give me peace
I'm not asking for a miracle, just you and me (Hey!)

[Chorus: Daya]
Yeah, I wanna know if you're gonna be there (You're gonna be there)
'Cause it's hard to believe or see it, yeah yeah
Why do I get the feeling?
We're getting close, but we'll never be there
'Cause it's hard to believe or see it, yeah yeah
Is it more than a feeling?

[Post-Chorus: Daya]
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know if you're gonna be there (You're gonna be there)
'Cause it's hard to believe or see it, yeah yeah
Why do I get the feeling?
I wanna know

[Outro: Daya]
I wanna know, I wanna know, kn-kn-know (Oh)
I wanna know, I wanna know, kn-kn-know (Oh)
