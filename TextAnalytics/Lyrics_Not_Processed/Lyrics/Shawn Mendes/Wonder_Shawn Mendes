[Verse 1]
I wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I forget about them
I wonder, I wonder

[Chorus]
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by

[Verse 2]
I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong and never said I was a saint
I wonder, when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder, I wonder

[Chorus]
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
I wonder what it's like to be loved by

[Outro]
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
