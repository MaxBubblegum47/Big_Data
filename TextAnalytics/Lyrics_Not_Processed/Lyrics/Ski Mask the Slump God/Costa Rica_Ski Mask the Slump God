[Verse 1: Reese LAFLARE]
I got big dreams so my watch got a big face (Big dreams)
Girls gettin' mixy like a motherfuckin' mixtape (I'm tellin' ya)
Smellin' like money and I'm lookin' like sex (Big racks)
I'm outside for real with the slimes and the slatts (Slatt)
Nigga ride wave, then the nigga get taxed (Hey)
Fendi snowpants and I fill 'em up with racks
They all ball cap, and this all facts (Big facts)
No, I don't relax and I don't lack

[Verse 2: Bas & Guapdad 4000]
Demons, they follow me deep in the dark
Niggas got problems with being a boss
We ain't been home but we hear all the talkin'
Hit 'em with hollows and clean 'em with salt
Salt in the wound and my heart in the cooler
Frozen like I gave my heart to my jeweler
Told him to make a new piece out of this
Ever since, I just can't give no fuck 'bout no bitch (It's a check)

[Chorus: Guapdad 4000]
Baby (Yeah), had to bustdown on the AP (AP), yeah
Baby (Yeah), ain't no rich styles on you lately (Rich), yeah
I got fans in Costa Rica (Fans), I got bands in Costa Rica (Big bands)
I got fans in Costa Rica (Big fans), I got bands in Costa Rica

[Verse 3: Jace]
I got the Mike Jack' nose, just before the vitiligo
Norman Bates with the eights, I'ma go psycho
Laundromat with a temper, this a vicious cycle
Feel like Rihanna, bitches go wherever I go
Go against the grain like I'm battlin' the silo
I'm going out west like I'm motherfuckin' Fievel
LeBron in the finals, motherfuckin' five-oh
Nigga bettin' under 5'4", hell if I know

[Verse 4: Mez & Guapdad 4000]
Niggas got me tight like Arthur's fist and shit
Like I'm not an arsonist and shit
Not a nigga that you wanna argue with
'Cause then you fucking with your future like Larsa Pippen, shit
Boy, I'm like a barber with this shit
You get out the chair, you get in the chair
The things in the mirror, the way they appear
You look to the rear, my niggas is near, my niggas revered
You fuckin' with Mez, you fuckin' with Heirs, nigga (It's a check)

[Chorus: Guapdad 4000]
Baby (Yeah), had to bustdown on the AP (AP), yeah
Baby (Yeah), ain't no rich styles on you lately (Rich), yeah
I got fans in Costa Rica (Fans), I got bands in Costa Rica (Big bands)
I got fans in Costa Rica (Big fans), I got bands in Costa Rica

[Verse 5: Smokepurpp]
I got balled up hundreds in my pocket (Hundreds)
Diamonds on me water like a faucet (Yeah, flash)
Got a lot of bands in Costa Rica
Lot of hoes in Costa Rica (Uh), got a passport in my pocket (Yeah)
And I flew with the stick, it's a rocket (Uh)
Forty-five on me, shit hot like a pocket (Doo-doo)
You ain't talkin' money, it's nonsense (Yeah)
Got your baby mama doing drugs in the moshpit

[Verse 6: JID & Guapdad 4000]
Top of the morning to anybody who thought it was beddy-bye
Jiddy, I'm like a Jedi
Mind tricks live inside of your head, I
Devilish, red eyes, never been on a redeye
Or shit, I be high, I forget
Shawty said I be wildin' and trippin' when I'm on a lick
Score a penny or twenty, I'm Dominique Wilkins and shit
Really I flew to Costa Rica with an AP
At the airport, this girl ask me, "Hey, are you Swae Lee?‚Äù
Wow (It's a check)

[Chorus: Guapdad 4000]
Baby (Yeah), had to bustdown on the AP (AP), yeah
Baby (Yeah), ain't no rich styles on you lately (Rich), yeah
I got fans in Costa Rica (Fans), I got bands in Costa Rica (Big bands)
I got fans in Costa Rica (Big fans), I got bands in Costa Rica

[Verse 7: Buddy & Ski Mask the Slump God]
Suffering succotash
She think it's all puddycat but, hell, I ain't even mad
I started sucking on her titty, put my thumb in her ass
She had a little one, it really wasn't nothin' to grab, I did it anyway
Nigga, I'm a bag
Comin' down the 91, flyin', doin' the dash
We goin' in today (Ayy)
And I been writing my ass off, Ernest Hemingway (Bitch)
I ain't got shit else to say

[Verse 8: Ski Mask the Slump God & Guapdad 4000]
I got too much skills
I flow like the water, so surprised I did not grow gills
And I am your father like you was Luke Skywalker
And I conquer and let it burn like Usher's perm and kill confirmed
You look concerned, respect is earned, uh
You really be in it, B, gotta be kiddin' me, uh
You really be sickenin', I got the remedy, uh
I'm feelin' like Goku, bitch, I need your energy, uh
Um, okay, huh, goin' on a date with an AK, huh (Yup)
Ayy, okay, goin' on a date with an AK, ayy (It's a check)

[Chorus: Guapdad 4000]
Baby (Yeah), had to bustdown on the AP (AP), yeah
Baby (Yeah), ain't no rich styles on you lately (Rich), yeah
I got fans in Costa Rica (Fans), I got bands in Costa Rica (Big bands)
