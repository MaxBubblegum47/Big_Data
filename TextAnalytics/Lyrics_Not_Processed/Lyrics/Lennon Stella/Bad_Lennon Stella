[Verse 1]
All the little gifts you gave
I call it overcompensating
Feeling just like a princess
Every answer was always yes
You had me living in a dream
Was forever long to you? (To you)
Did you say that to her too?
Making sure that I’d never know
Callin' her while the shower goes
Then crawl back in bed, it's a shame

[Pre-Chorus]
I probably should’ve known better
I probably should’ve known better
Every word you said
Yeah, you was sweet, but you was lying
Everything you covered up
Making up, just to keep me from crying, oh

[Chorus]
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
The truth is, you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
Truth is, you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad

[Verse 2]
I wasn’t catching on to you (To you)
Blinded by your lips, so smooth (So smooth)
Excusing all of your 'gotta go's'
Leaving me to be all alone
Then you took my heart just the same

[Pre-Chorus]
I probably should’ve known better
I probably should’ve known better
Every word you said, yeah, you was sweet, but you was lying
Everything you covered up, making up, just to keep me from crying, oh

[Chorus]
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
The truth is, you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
Truth is, you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad

[Bridge]
Tell me the truth
Was it worth it? Was I worth it for you?
'Cause we were perfect, we working 'til you
Forgot to tell me you been seeing someone else for six years, o
h

[Chorus]
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
The truth is, you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
Truth is, you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad
