[Verse 1]
I apologize, my emotions are hidinâ€™
Hard to explain when you feel your world's on fire
Close my eyes to all the things that hurt my nature
I apologize, but I am
Apologize, but I am
Apologize, but I am

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of holdin' my head up
I'm tired of tryin' to hold onto you
This cycle, fighting and making up
I'm tired of tryin' to hold on

[Chorus]
Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
There's no rewindin' the things we say
Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
No way to fight it

[Post-Chorus]
I'll break, breakaway
Break, breakaway
I'll break, breakaway
Break, breakaway
I'll break

[Verse 2]
The ground and the ceilin' seem to be disappearing
Nothin' to stand on, oh God, I hate this feelin'
You put the weight of your world down on my shoulders
Why'd you have to make me older?
Make me older, make me older

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of holdin' my head up
I'm tired of tryin' to hold onto you
This cycle, fighting and making up
I'm tired of tryin' to hold on

[Chorus]
Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
There's no rewindin' the things we say
Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
No way to fight it

[Post-Chorus]
I'll break, breakaway
Break, breakaway
I'll break, breakaway
Break, breakaway

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
There's no rewindin' the things we say
Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
No way to fight it

[Post-Chorus]
I'll break, breakaway
Break, breakaway
I'll break, breakaway
Break, breakaway
