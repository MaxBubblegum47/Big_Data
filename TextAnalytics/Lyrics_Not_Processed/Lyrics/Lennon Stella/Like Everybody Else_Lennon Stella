[Verse 1]
Run fast
Run away
Run straight into the loneliness
It isn’t only home I miss
Like the night all my friends got together
Heard about it afterwards
Didn’t think was gonna hurt so much
Why if I am doing so well
Did I build a wall between me and the world?

[Chorus]
Been drilled in my head forever
Be better
Turns out I’m just like everybody else
Don’t even go near a mirror
It’ll kill ya
Trust me you don’t wanna see yourself
Fuck the noise
It’s too late
It’s the choices
Now I don’t even wanna be someone
What made me think I was special
I’m not special
Turns out I’m like everybody else

[Verse 2]
That’s nice
Champagne
What a shame it doesn’t work on me
So don’t go wasting your money
Everybody in this room is too hard, too pretty
I’m tired
I just wanna be nobody

[Chorus]
Been drilled in my head forever
Be better
Turns out I’m just like everybody else
Don’t even go near a mirror
It’ll kill ya
Trust me you don’t wanna see yourself
Fuck the noise
It’s too late
It’s the choices (oh)
Now I don’t even wanna be someone
What made me think I was special
I’m not special
Turns out I’m like everybody else

[Outro]
What made me think I was special
I’m not special
Turns out I’m like everybody else
