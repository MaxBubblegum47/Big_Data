[Verse 1]
My heart's seen things I wish it didn't
Somewhere, I lost some of my innocence
And I miss it
I miss it
Stay up all night thinking it's twisted
My life's been survival of the fittest
But I did it
I did it

[Pre-Chorus]
I do all my own healing
Manage all in my feelings
I don't ask for help, no
'Cause I don't need it, 'cause I don't need it

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I wish I could do something stupid
Be kinda reckless while I can
Say I don't give a damn
But I'm older than I am
I could get hurt and get some scars to prove it
Just say to hell with all my plans
'Cause I don't give a damn
But I'm older than I am

[Verse 2]
Why am I always the one making decisions?
How do I handle the pressure?
I do my best to fake it (Mmm)
But honestly, I hate it (Mmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I do all my own fighting
I'm who I'ma confide in
Maybe I need help, no
I won't deny it, I won't deny it

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I wish I could do something stupid
Be kinda reckless while I can
Say I don't give a damn
But I'm older than I am
I could get hurt and get some scars to prove it
Just say to hell with all my plans
'Cause I don't give a damn
But I'm older than I am

[Outro]
Older than I, older than I, older than I
I'm older and I don't give a damn
I'm older than I am
