[Part I: Cinderella]

[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Uh, $ign
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no ($ign)
Ayy

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturin' you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella, better get your ass home
Man, I swear that parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me
To my room (My room)
Girl, I got a suite at the SLS (SLS), uh
I already know you got expensive taste (Yeah)
Ayy, take my hand (My hand), follow me (Follow me)
To my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl, I got a plan for the whole night

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Okay, your legs just like
A store: they open up and you got people in line
Been there every night for weeks at a time
You in my dreams, that's why I sleep all the time
Just to hear you say I love you, just to touch you, just to leave you behind
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine
This type of thing, I heard it happen all the time
Yeah, I just wanna see you fly
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like [?], go a second and a third time
Left you a perverse mind
And when you hungry, I can chef you up a stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate ya third eye
First prize, Nobel, get a piece
Your clothes off, turn around, lemme see

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturin' you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella, better get your ass home
Man, I swear that parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me
To my room
Girl, I got a suite at the SLS, uh
I already know you got expensive taste (Uh)
Take my hand, follow me
To my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl, I got a plan for the whole night

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay
I came up with a plan, it was take you by the hand
And bring you somewhere where the sand is, soon as we landed
We went straight into the room and played the music
Started dancin', you was takin' off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore, I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we movin' to the floor
You started gettin' crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel, now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't ya type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doin' everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn, it feels so right (Yeah)
But I still respect ya game, every time I'm out-of-line
You always set me straight, the sex is great, for Heaven's sakes
I need it every day, I yell your name, Cinderella
Never gonna find nobody better, all my life...

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturin' you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella, better get your ass home
Man, I swear that parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me
To my room
Girl, I got a suite at the SLS, uh
I already know you got expensive taste, uh
Take my hand, follow me
To my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl, I got a plan for the whole night, ayy

[Part II: Right After Love]

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey now, I'm sayin'
My only way out is a way in
I won't stop
'Til you mine, no way
Well, all my days now, they changin'
I got an angels, no more Satan
Looks like God's on my side
This time, yeah

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
Been meanin' to tell ya
You lookin' better every day
Write you letters, it's only right that
Right after love, I write my name, yeah
If it's forever or never, it's all the same
Under the weather, feel much better
When that weather isn't rain, yeah

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Ooh, Cinderella
Don't you run out of time
It feels like you've been takin'
All day, yeah
Well, wherever you came from, wherever you goin'
I promise I'm not far behind, yeah
So don't you dare throw this away

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
I been meanin' to tell ya
You look better every day
Write you letters, it's only right that
Right after love, I write my name, yeah
And if it's forever or never, it's all the same
Under the weather, feel much better
When that weather isn't rain
