[Intro: Frayser Click]
Do la mia pace, non guardare i nostri peccati, ma alla fede della tua chiesa, e donale unità e pace secondo la tua volontà, tu che vivi e regni nei secoli dei secoli
Amen
La pace del signore sia sempre con voi
E con il tuo spirito
Demons takin' over me, go on another killing spree
Demons takin’ over, demons—demons takin' over me
Demons takin' over me, go on another killing spree
Demons takin’ over, demons—demons takin' over me

[Verse 1: Ramirez & 
ZillaKami
]
Bitch, I'm that mothafucka you don't wanna fuck with
I keep the Glock right by my side, ready to bust shit
You thought that you could act up but there's repercussions
Bitch, I don't give a motherfuck 'cause I'm disgusting (Yeah)
Bring your crucifixes ’cause I’m spreadin' like the plague (Hey)
Welcome to the black abyss (Ah), where your soul cannot be saved
Deep inside the mystic fog, a dead man rises from his grave (Yeah)
They still know me in the hood as the one who is not named (Shh)
Ayy, standin’ by the flames, I'll make a oath and then I sacrifice
Baphomet, rise from your throne, I sit here and I give you life
Blood is drippin' from the ceiling, dwellin', havin’ evil visions
Pumpin' on the shotty but Ramirez 'bout to pull and kill it
Murder runnin' through my mind, go get your bible
It's the one that sits up in the dark, the Jesus rival
Step into the chamber with the tortures and the psycho
Falling to your fucking knees and beg for your survival (
Yeah!
)

[Verse 2: ZillaKami]
Bitch, I'm that Godzilla you don't wanna stomp with (Huh?)
All bloody noses, the crowd killer in the moshpit (Okay)
When I enter into your life, it is a plot twist (Uh-huh)
To end your story, you don't have no other option (Yeah)
Bring you into Hell and then I go into your burial (Huh?)
Sad to say you goin' deeper down in lower areas (Uh-huh)
Make it rain the fish and frogs, oh Jesus, what a miracle (Okay)
They bow to the 'Dog because resistance wasn't logical (Wassup?)
Spread my plague (Yeah), dead eye, rage (Yeah)
Drink the punch into my daze (Yeah)
Spread my plague (Yeah), rise from graves (Yeah)
Go tell mom, "It's not a phase" (Yeah)

Demons takin' over me, go on another killing spree
Demons takin' over, demons—demons takin' over me
Demons takin' over me, go on another killing spree
Demons takin' over, demons—demons takin' over me
Demons takin' over me, go on another killing spree
Demons takin' over, demons—demons takin' over me
Demons takin' over me, go on another killing spree
Demons takin' over, demons—demons takin' over me
Nello spirito del Cristo risorto, diamoci un gesto di pace
