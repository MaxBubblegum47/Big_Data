[Intro: Ramirez]
Fine wine and a diamond necklace
Baby, give me one night with you
We're moving in the right direction
Baby, give me one night to prove
Hahahaha, yeah
You are now in tune to the midnight hour
Makin' your soul quiver, your spine shiver
The one and only, Daddy Longstroke
And I'm about to put the sounds of the majestic
Cafecito bandito with the furious fire

[Verse 1: Ramirez]
Catch a playa slidin' in the Skylark, glidin'
Dippin' inside my hoopty, gunnin', runnin' from sirens
I'm 'bout my chips, never been about no bitch
Standin' tall on my two own, serve a busta the drip, uh
You ain't no factor, lookin' like just an actor
Penny pinchers hangin' upon my nuts
Comin' after a playa's guala, envious of a baller
Whippin' the bucket just like a foreign and poppin' collars

[Bridge: Ramirez]
We got no money, but I wanna give you
Fine wine and a diamond necklace
Baby, give me one night to prove
No one can give you what I got
I think we're movin' in the right direction
Baby, give me one night with you

[Chorus: Ramirez]
You see me rollin' in the hoopty, mane, it ain't a thing
Dippin' inside the 'Lac with diamonds all in my chain
Smokin' Mary Jane, this be the game
Bitch, I'm about my dollars, you keep all of the defame
You see me rollin' in the hoopty, mane, it ain't a thing
Dippin' inside the 'Lac with diamonds all in my chain
Smokin' Mary Jane, this be the game
Bitch, I'm about my dollars, you keep all of the defame

[Verse 2: Pouya]
Yuh, when I die, bury me in my FTP
Baby, said you want a player, then come play with me
Got a couple million sittin' in my ACT
And I'm just about to reach a quarter-century
What a life I live
Fifty out the casino, I could use another night like this
Too many sodomites tryna suck up my energy
Your best friend always turn out to be your biggest enemy

[Bridge: Ramirez]
We got no money, but I wanna give you
Fine wine and a diamond necklace
Baby, give me one night to prove
No one can give you what I got
I think we're movin' in the right direction
Baby, give me one night with you

[Verse 3: Shakewell]
I feel the tides, know the times change but I'm still with you
It feels like I die, see the light within you
Know you never noticed me until I left home
One day you'll say you love for me, by then I'll be gone (Sip)

[Bridge: Ramirez]
We got no money, but I wanna give you
Fine wine and a diamond necklace
Baby, give me one night to prove
No one can give you what I got
I think we're movin' in the right direction
Baby, give me one night with you

[Chorus: Ramirez]
You see me rollin' in the hoopty, mane, it ain't a thing
Dippin' inside the 'Lac with diamonds all in my chain
Smokin' Mary Jane, this be the game
Bitch, I'm about my dollars, you keep all of the defame
You see me rollin' in the hoopty, mane, it ain't a thing
Dippin' inside the 'Lac with diamonds all in my chain
Smokin' Mary Jane, this be the game
Bitch, I'm about my dollars, you keep all of the defame
You see me rollin' in the hoopty, mane, it ain't a thing
Dippin' inside the 'Lac with diamonds all in my chain
Smokin' Mary Jane, this be the game
Bitch, I'm about my dollars, you keep all of the defame
You see me rollin' in the hoopty, mane, it ain't a thing
Dippin' inside the 'Lac with diamonds all in my chain
Smokin' Mary Jane, this be the game
Bitch, I'm about my dollars, you keep all of the defame

[Outro: Ramirez]
Fine wine and a diamond necklace
Baby, give me one night to prove
We're movin' in the right direction
Baby, give me one night with you
Fine wine and a diamond necklace
Bab,y give me one night to prove
We're movin' in the right direction
Baby, give me one night with you
