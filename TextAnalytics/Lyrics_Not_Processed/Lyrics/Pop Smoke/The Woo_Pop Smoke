She want a Woo nigga

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
She wanna fuck with the Woo
She wanna fuck with the Woo
She wanna fuck with the Woo

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch]
I told her, "Ooh-woo-woo"
Shawty wanna fuck me inside of the coupe
I can take you out everywhere, fuck a jet fare
Versace hotel with Versace robe, woah, woah
Like you when you let down your hair with no comb
And I stay to myself 'cause I never liked these hoes (Yeah)
And she only liked the guap, red light these hoes
Why would I waste my time on a shorty that don't got me on the front of her mind?
Especially when you get designer and I wine and dine
And the Bentley came with the wings like a number nine, yeah
Come through, just us two
I like you 'cause you cut how I'm cut too
Come through, just us two
I like you 'cause you cut how I'm cut too

[Chorus: Pop Smoke & Roddy Ricch]
She wanna fuck with the Woo (Ayy, she wanna fuck with the Woo, Woo)
She wanna fuck with the Woo
She wanna fuck with the Woo
She wanna ride with the Woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
That's my kind of bitch, she be sayin' some shit
Like, "When you gon' fly me in private, so I can land on that dick?"
She said, "Tricks is for kids", she don't fall for the tricks
She can handle her own, she just want some dick
Got that big Birkin bag worth five, six figures
You might be out your league, can you buy that, nigga? (Buy that)
I pull up on her top gone on the Dawn, I'm the don
You can fuck around, if you want, if you want
Out in Bali, big swing, big dress
Big ass, make her squirt and make a big mess
Before we done, she ask "Where we gon' do it next?"
Next, so wet it fucked up the seats in the jet
She like all that gangsta shit
Top down, ridin' 'round with the blick
Who you with? Woo
She like all that gangsta shit
I said, "She like all that gangsta shit"

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
She wanna fuck with the Woo
She wanna fuck with the Woo
She wanna fuck with the Woo
She wanna ride with the Woo (Hahaha)

[Verse 3: Pop Smoke]
Let me take you to the candy shop (Candy shop)
Show you all I got (All I got, all I got)
I put diamonds on your chain (Chain, uh)
To match your diamond ring (Uh, uh, uh)
I'm 092, nigga, Woo (Woo, back)
Hate it or love it (Uh, uh), it's me and you (Woo)
Let's turn nothin' into something
She said she love Woo niggas (Woo, uh)
Them niggas who gon' pull triggers (Grrt, oh)
I was fine when I met you (Met you, pow)
Then I sexed you (Woo)
Then I left you (Uh)
'Cause your pussy feel the same (Feel the same, feel the same)
And I don't got time to waste (No time to waste)

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
She wanna fuck with the Woo
She wanna fuck with the Woo
She wanna fuck with the Woo
She wanna ride with the Woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
