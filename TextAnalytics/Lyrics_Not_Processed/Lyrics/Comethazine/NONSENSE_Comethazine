[Chorus]
Bitch, miss me with that nonsense, you broke, got nine cents
I ball hard like Dennis Rodman, no lyin'
I just fucked that bitch and then I nutted on her eyelid
I smoke so much dope, my bitch be calling me a pothead
Gucci-Gucci on my feet now, she wanna meet now
Took my pants off now it's time for her to eat now
She gobbled on my dick and then I told her she should leave now
Had to kick that little slutty bitch up out my treehouse

[Verse]
I came in this bitch with my gun out
If he want some smoke then we gon' run down, that boy done now
Put a silencer up on my gun, I change the gun sound
Hundred round clip, I let it hit 'til it ain't no rounds
Comethazine that nigga and you knew that
Eighty-eighty thousand dollars worth of jewelry on my crewneck
Your bitch, she be givin' up that top, she gave my crew neck
My bitch booty jiggle when she walk, it really do that

[Chorus]
Bitch, miss me with that nonsense, you broke, got nine cents
I ball hard like Dennis Rodman, no lyin'
I just fucked that bitch and then I nutted on her eyelid
I smoke so much dope, my bitch be calling me a pothead, yeah
Gucci on my feet now, she wanna meet now
Took my pants off now it's time for her to eat now
She gobbled on my dick and then I told her she should leave now
Had to kick that little slutty bitch up out my treehouse
