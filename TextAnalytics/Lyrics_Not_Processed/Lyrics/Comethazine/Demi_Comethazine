[Chorus]
I just wanna fuck Demi, nut on her titties
Whip out my cock, ayy, make the bitch lick it
I just wanna fuck Demi, bitch, fuck with me
I know you like chocolate, bitch, don't be stingy

[Verse]
Take off yo' top, take off yo' socks
I know you not a slut, bitch, I know you not a thot
Bitch, I like that, let me hit it from the back
Let me take off my pants, let me put away my Strap
Bitch, don't be scared 'cause you know I got yo' back
Let me take you out, yeah, let's go buy a house, yeah
Let's go fuck some bands up, blow a hunnid thou', yeah
Yes, bitch, I'm rich, I know you rich too
I don't give a fuck about yo' man, he a goof
Baby, let's duck off, let's go smoke some boof
Let's go hit the stu', I know you like to sing
You gon' be my bitch if I buy yo' ass this ring, ayy
Check yo' DM, ho, why the fuck you playin'?
I hit you every day, but yo' ass ain't seen, yeah
But yo' ass will, and when you do, it's over
I'ma get yo' fuckin' name tatted on my shoulder
I just signed a deal, my wrist got colder
I just wanna fuck Demi Lovato when I'm older

[Chorus]
I just-I just wanna fuck Demi, nut on her titties
Whip out my cock, ayy, make the bitch lick it
I just wanna fuck Demi, bitch, fuck with me
I know you like chocolate, bitch, don't be stingy
I just wanna fuck Demi, nut on her titties
Whip out my cock, ayy, make the bitch lick it
I just wanna fuck Demi, bitch, fuck with me
I know you like chocolate, bitch, don't be stingy
