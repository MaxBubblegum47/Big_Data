[Intro]
Bitch, yeah
Push through the city, I'm in a new whip (Skrrt)
We boolin' in here (Bitch, bitch)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Move through the city, I'm in a new whip
Interior red, we boolin' in here
I smoke out the pound, I smoke out the zip
Bitch, I'm smokin' on cookie, drink lean like it's milk
This Glock holdin' thirty, I bought a new clip
She tryna talk, I'm tryna hit
Ho, shut the fuck up and suck on this dick
I just went shopping, I bought so much shit
He talkin' tough, he get hit in the lip with the stick, kn-knock him right off of his shit, b-bitch
Thirty-five hundred I spent on a fit and 'bout 55K on my wrist (Alright)
Ball like Kobe or DeMar DeRozan, when I pull up, lil' bitch, I don't miss (Come here)
Off-White, Goyard, Supreme, I be rockin' this shit 'cause I'm rich (I'm rockin' that shit 'cause I'm rich)
All white, Nike Air Force Ones, and they lookin' so nice with the fit
Move through the city, I'm in a new whip
Interior red, we boolin' in here
I smoke out the pound, I smoke out the zip
Bitch, I'm smokin' on cookie, drink lean like it's milk
This Glock holdin' thirty, I bought a new clip
She tryna talk, I'm tryna hit
Ho, shut the fuck up and suck on this dick
I just went shopping, I bought so much shit
He talkin' tough, he get hit in the lip with the stick, knock him right off of his shit, bitch
Thirty-five hundred I spent on a fit and 'bout 55K on my wrist
 (Alright)
