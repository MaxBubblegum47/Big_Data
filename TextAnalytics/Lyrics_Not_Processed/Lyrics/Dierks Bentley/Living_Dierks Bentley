[Verse 1]
This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Verse 2]
I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said "Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough"

[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Post-Chorus]
Like you never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missing
Some days you're living

It'a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

[Chorus]
Some days you start singin'
And you don't need a reason
Sometimes the world's just right
Your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'
Got a heart full of grateful
For all you've been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Post-Chorus]
Livin' like you'll never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missin'
Some days you're living
Some days you're living
