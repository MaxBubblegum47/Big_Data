[Verse 1]
Bet you think I'm sitting at home, naw
Bet you think that I'm all alone, naw
I bet you think I'm missing you and wishing you would call my phone
Hell naw
I went wheels up on a runway
And that ticket was a one-way

[Chorus]
I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

[Verse 2]
Heard you called my boys
Heard you called my folks
They said you drove by my house real slow
You can check any spot, roll down every road
But girl, I ain't even close

[Chorus]
I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

[Bridge]
I wish it could've worked out
But I'm gettin' over you now
On a beach towel
My shades on
My drink's up and the sun's out
I'm somewhere on a beach

[Chorus]
I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach
