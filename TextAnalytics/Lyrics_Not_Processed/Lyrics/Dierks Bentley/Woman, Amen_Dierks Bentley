[Intro]
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
I'd lose my way and I'd lose my mind
If I faced one day on my own
I know I was saved
The night that she gave this drifter's heart a home

[Chorus]
Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say near enough
Thank God for this woman, amen

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh

[Verse 2]
This world has a way of shaking your faith
I've been broken again and again
But I need all the cracks in my shattered heart
'Cause that's where her love gets in

[Chorus]
Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say near enough
Thank God for this woman, amen

[Post Chorus]
She gives me faith (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me grace (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me hope (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me strength (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me love (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
Love without end (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
Thank God for this woman, amen (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
Thanks for the moon and the stars up above
Forgiveness of sin in Your undying love
Every twist every turn for the way You made sure
All my roads led to her

[Chorus]
So tonight I will fall down on my knees
'Cause Lord knows how lucky I am
I'm gonna shout at the top of my lungs
Thank God for this woman, amen
And thank God for this woman, amen

[Outro]
She gives me faith (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me grace (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me hope (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me strength (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me love (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
Love without end (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
Thank God for this woman, amen (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
