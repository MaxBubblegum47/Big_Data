[Verse 1]
She got, she got, she got her own reasons for talking to me
And she don't, she don't, she don't give a fuck about what I need

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't tell you why because my brain can't equate it
Tell me your lies because I just can't face it

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's you
It's you, it's you, it's you

[Verse 2]
I won't, I won't, I won't cover the scars, I'll let 'em bleed
So my silence, so my silence won't be mistaken for peace

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I wrong for wanting us to make it?
Tell me your lies because I just can't face it

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's you
It's you, it's you it's you

[Bridge]
Could it be that it's a lesson that I never had to learn?
I looked at it like a blessing and now it's just a curse
I don't know why, I don't know why

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you, it's you
