Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Found these versions, making me feel so [?]
Self-medicating, but I don't think they'll find it
Turns out I found peace in the dark but now I'm waking up on top floors
Morning [?], the morning and the morning
What am I doing this for? What am I doing this for?

[Chorus]
Okay, four in the morning like a ghost
Oh yeah, [?] the most
Okay, here we go again
Seeing it all, seemingly fall, babe
