Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Take in stride, love and devotion
Don't confide, it's the tracks of lost emotion
Let it glide, it's gonna subside
She stole my

[Chorus]
But if just she stole my heart

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I thought I love the light, common day
I ain't going for the drama, kid
Niggas moving to the city, seek for attention
Everything we do, word, shit got me stressin
Stressed out, [?]
My boys smoke [?] no stress, just lifestyle choices
Everyday I wake up, I get dressed, for who? For what?
A city shut down, a ghost town
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
Lot, lot, and that's all I got

[Verse 2: Ryan Betty]
I got everything, the summer came
[?] better day
But I still have dreams of you
I got good dreams of you
She stole my heart, before I landed
Stole my heart, hope I understand it
Stole my heart, but I still got dreams of you
I got good dreams of you

[Chorus]
Stole my heart
But if just she stole my heart
