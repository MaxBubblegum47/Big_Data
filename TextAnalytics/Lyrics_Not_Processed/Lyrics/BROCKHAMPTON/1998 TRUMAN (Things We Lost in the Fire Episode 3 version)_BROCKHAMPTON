[Chorus: bearface]
(Freak ah, ah) Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (Free, free)
Oh yeah (Yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 1: bearface]
Taking time, faking mine
Let your hair lay on this side
Bless your mind, baby it's over and done (yeah, yeah yeah)
'Cause I know the way to make-
You know I hate to lie
But you are, you are, you are baby
But you gotta be free

[Chorus: bearface]
(Freak ah, ah) Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (Free, free)
Oh yeah (Yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 2: bearface]
Over eighteen with the windows fogged
Her brown skin with our fingers locked
Feel the air like it's sunny out
But I don't want you to go girl cause I'm tired of the waiting
Tired of waiting (ay, ay, yeah)
Tired of waiting, but you gotta be free

[Chorus: bearface]
(Freak ah, ah) Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (Free, free)
Oh yeah (Yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah (Yeah)
