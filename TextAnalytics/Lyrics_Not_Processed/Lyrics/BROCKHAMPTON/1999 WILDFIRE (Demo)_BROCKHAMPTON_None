[Verse 1: Jazze Pha]
...no pressure (no pressure!)
Like a pistol out the top dresser (pew!)
My shit bang, I get cash, all hunnid dollar bills, no chingaling
Cool like the other side of the pillow (aye!)
Caddy got white walls on it (skrr, skrrt!)
Big daddy got ice all on me (blingin')
Super clean like Lysol, homie (ooh)
You say it’s some [?], I say it's a shame, but you would give me your body before your name
And I don't know why
And I can’t explain
I, spin around like Michael Jackson (uh-huh!)
Reminisce 'cause I'm 'bout that action (uh, nah!)
Just wanna give some satisfaction!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract 
 & Jazze Pha
]
My hands up, 
I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, 
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze,
 places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, 
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
All my dogs in a pack formation
Niggas say my name when they agitated
Nigga learn better, you can ask yo' lady
Pretty bad thang, wanna have my baby
Nigga I'm rich, I’m just actin’ broke
I don't understand what you hate me for...
