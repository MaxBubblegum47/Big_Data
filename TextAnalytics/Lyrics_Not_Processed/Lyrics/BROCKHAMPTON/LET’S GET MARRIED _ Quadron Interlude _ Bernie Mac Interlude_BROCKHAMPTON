"Yo, this is Kevin Cinema and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1."
"Ay, this is Matt and this is Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."
"Hey, what's up, it's Shawn Mendes and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."

[Verse: Joba]
It's too damn easy, to hide away, or run away
For me they're both the same, I just need a reason
Before I choose to stay before I choose to say "I love you"
These three simple words, have caused me so much hurt
Ooh, la, la, ooh, la, la
I feel it, I'm feeling, those feelings, I feel them
Ooh
Was told the beauty's in the details
But I'm not the type to say how I might feel
Started in high school, got my diploma
Then dropped out of college, always been a hard-head
Lacking in knowledge
But goddamn, man, when will this end?
I need new friends
And maybe it's okay to fall in love again

[Spoekn Word: Bernie Mac, Charlie Rose]
"If I dedicate myself to one thing, I need to focus on that
If I dedicate myself to something else, I need to focus on that
To try and do all these, and do the road, do stand up, and do a television show and then try to deal with our marriage and our home? Something's gonna give. Something's gonna give and I don't want to do that."
"And what's the most precious to you beyond family?"
"My comedy."
"Comedy. Not the sitcom, not the stand-up, just comedy?"
"My comedy."
"Being able to create truth..."
"Right."
"And enjoy, and entertain"

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
