[Lyrics from leak]

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Ayy boy, (You can turn it up a little bit)
Ayy boy, calm your ass down boy 
(this that down South)
You know what I'm talkin' about?

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
This that down South nigga music
This that Whitney Houston,
 museum, movement music
That them niggas ain't used to
I bought a car that I can't scoot in 
and there's some clothes that I just looked at
Ever since I heard we playin' Coachella
I took a stack and made a rap and I ain't never look back
It make me sad when my parents wanna come to the shows
'Cause I diss 'em in my songs and they know every word
All my niggas get along but their egos berserk
'Cause we finally getting money and the girls wanna twerk
And I love doin' Perc', I had to buy me a Perc'
I gotta purse for my nephew now his classmates stare
"Oh, your uncle a rapper? Is he Lil Uzi Vert?"
"Nah, my uncle is gay and they think he a gimmick"
How the fuck I'm a gimmick if I'm up at the clinic
Gettin' tested 'cause I take dick so motherfuckin' often
Bitches better calm me down before I motherfuckin' toss 'em
Ayy, nigga

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Dom McLennon and 
Matt Champion
]
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
(
At night I bring them out, I was
)

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Sleeping upside down, keep you up, I come around
They stay right up on my tail, hopin' it's a fishscale
Human, I see through your eyes
Until my CCC and see blood in my skin
They can see they move my feet like DDR
Hangin' out the car, dreamin' of the tour
They grip three types of the gas, miss the days I can't get back
Hope the dollar kill me last, hate the way they really see me
Christina I move like genie
My nose wrinkle lot like Jeannie
Regal feelings, I steam it
Hop in the four and Iâ€™m speedin', bleedin'
She wavin' out the backseat, ayy, gettin' nasty
Killa motion, phone beep for the C4, bitch I'm coastin'
(Let me hear that)

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
Swimmin' in money, I know that they love me
They pay me in hundreds or pay me in gold (oh)
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I feel alone, I sold a piece of my soul (please)
I don't feel love anymore, where did it go?
I got a heart and then filled it with holes
Dipped it with glitter and gold
I wanna die, but it's some shit I should buy
Feelin' so empty inside (oh)
The more that I get, the less I can feel
The more that I smoke, the more I forget
I hit the road with my bitch in my whip, that's all

[Bridge]
Somebody help me now, right now
Oh, somebody check it out, yellow
Please, somebody help me now, right now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist (oh)
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist (please)
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
Alright, yeah, woo! Now nigga, what's the word?
I got a thousand dollar one-way train to Luxembourg
I'm drinkin' whiskey with no ice, I feel my stomach burn
I made a life I want, I know that make your stomach turn
We sprinting slowly towards our ending, how will you submerge?
I'm drownin' daily in my seat that's why my dreams absurd
I'm noddin' out behind the wheel, don't know 'bout who concerned (let me hear how that sounds)
