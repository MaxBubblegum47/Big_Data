Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Countin' all my blessings, and count my dollars
Make it [?], I'll tell you half way
If you see me at the bar take a upper hour
And I deal my many mans on my daily shower
Now they wonder why I'm trippin', I'll tell you now, bruh
Got my homies on the corner, yeah, they pushin' sour
If you see me on the club, [?]
If you beat it on the floor, I show you how it works
Show you how, show you–

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
(Yeah yeah-eah, yeah-yeah-eah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
They want the money, power–
