[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I'm not a hypocrite, I'm human
I make mistakes to make sure I never repeat 'em
Inhaler help me breathe in South Central hot
Smoke like a chimney, I hope I don't get got
And I ain't had no pussy in two months
I been busy man, I been working man
And I ain't called my mom in three days
I hope she miss me, man
I know she love me, man
All these feelings bottled up about to set me off
And most is extra meat that lingering get cut off
Yeah we've been making money, yeah we've been making guap
While you've been walking in the meeting's 'bout to suck some
Dick
I left my bitch in Malibu
I left my smokes up on the roof
So don't forget who you're talking to
If I bring it in existence it gon' come true

[Chorus: bearface]
The matter's over-complicated, oh
But I'm never overcompensating, ooh
Spinning around makes it harder to pave my way
Resting my prize will make me end our love either way

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I know I make mistakes, I try to not repeat 'em
But I'm still working on it, negotiate with demons
I stop fucking girls the first time I meet 'em
And I don't talk to strangers about my new arrangements
I got big dreams of selling out arenas
They comin' out to see me, white folks in the meetings
And they smiling at me, but I'm the same nigga
Point them hoses at me, send the dogs for me

[Chorus: bearface]
The matter's over-complicated, oh
But I'm never overcompensating, ooh
Spinning around makes it harder to pave my way
Resting my prize will make me end our love either way

[Outro: JOBA]
I don't got much money
But I'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alright
I don't got much money
But I'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alright
