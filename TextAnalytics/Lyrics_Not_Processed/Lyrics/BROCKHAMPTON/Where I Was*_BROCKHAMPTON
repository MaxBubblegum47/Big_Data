[Sample]
Pardon the, uhh, technical difficulties
Pardon the, uhh, technical difficulties

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Close my eyes and think about where I was
Before the buzz and the drugs, before the clubs and the doves
Hillbillies running from Texas, we move to the city
South Central was the home, but now my dome feel empty
When them boys tried to press me, made my heart feel itchy
Gang sings so sticky, yeah my boys hit lickies
Man I dare you to tip me
I'm addicted to risky
I'm addicted to corny
Often times it's so boring
Waking up in the morning
See the usual story
I don't wanna keep running from [?]
It's easy to do, it's so easy to lose
It's a challenge to fight
I'm never done getting [?]
I'm never done hanging on
I'm never done seeing you
No matter how hard I try
It's always a sequel, sequel, sequel
