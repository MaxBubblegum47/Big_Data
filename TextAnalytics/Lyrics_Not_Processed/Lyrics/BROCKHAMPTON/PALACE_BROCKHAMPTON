[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
On a palace floor I see my soul
Banging through the doors, we swing 'em closed
We need glass or something strong
For the creeps when you come 'round

[Bridge: Bearface]
I feel like fucking on the west side like bullets out a gun
These strangers coming out about twice as strong
Yeah, I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

[Chorus: Joba]
I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I’m everything I am
I’m everything I am
But you don’t know me
I’m everything I am
With everything I am
You don’t know me

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Hold me down, I know I've lost control
Picking up all of my dirty bones
Oh I know there's something wrong
Freak me out when you come round

[Bridge: Bearface]
I feel like fucking on the west side like bullets out a gun
These strangers coming out about twice as strong
Yeah, I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

[Chorus: Joba]
I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I’m everything I am
I’m everything I am
But you don’t know me
I’m everything I am
With everything I am
You don’t know me

[Outro: Joba]
At all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all (You don't know)
At all, at all, at all, at all
