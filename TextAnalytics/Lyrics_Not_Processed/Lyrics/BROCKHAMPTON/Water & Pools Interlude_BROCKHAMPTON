[Interlude: Jaden Smith]
You know, I really love pools, and I love water because it's really fun to be in water and be in pools... And I like to drink water, and um, I went to go see BROCKHAMPTON at their house in Beverly Hills and they had a pool and there was water inside of it. And we made a song, um, but yeah that's why I've just always loved pools and water."
"Hold on, hold on, hold on! Is that what I think it is? Is this what I think it is!? Is this new BROCKHAMPTON!? Oh, they about to play a new BROCKHAMPTON song!? I think we about to play a new BROCKHAMPTON song! Let's go!"
