[Interlude: Kevin Abstract, Merlyn Wood, Dom McLennon]
I got all my money saved, I'm with them boys my momma hate
That's fire
I take the time to celebrate, ah...
Ah, hah, ah, hah, I got all my money saved, I'm with them boys my momma hate. I take some time to celebrate, my hands to the sky
That's so good
I love that
What made you think of that?
It just felt right, coming after Dom's verse, yeah...

[Intro]
Too many, too many times wasted

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
Wait a minute where my dogs at?
Players who ain't scared of love's at?
What's the point of saying "Fall back?"
Reaper gon' come  and stall that
Karma comin' where your false at?
Let em stunt on us we floss back
I keep my treatment to the sky, let my friend fly
Feel like y'all don't notice how I peace of mind
I got a lot to say and much to think about
Shrugged the haters off my back now I'm relieved of doubt
Lookin' deep into the ocean tell me what emotions that you dream about
I just want devotion from the moments that I [?] when I'm screamin' now
I'm lookin' for a partner that I'll share my pain with where we gon' do the same shit
