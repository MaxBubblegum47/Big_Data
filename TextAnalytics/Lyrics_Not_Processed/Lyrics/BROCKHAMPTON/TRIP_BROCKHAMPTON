[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Flap, flap, flap your wings, go high
Go high, go high
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride around the night
This little town, I wanna say goodbye
To everybody here cause they're all the same
I hate this place
And everybody here is all the same
Life's a disgrace

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Flying on my rocket ship (
ay!
), I'm on an acid trip (
ay!
)
I need another pill, snort and let it drip
I'm with my white friends, we getting wasted
Trapped in the suburbs, we suffocatin' (
ay!
)
We get all our drug (
ay!
) and education
"You came with black folks?" Hoe, your parents racist
You say they hate me? Well, I love them
We still roll up, we still best friends (
ay!
)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Everybody smilin', I don't see what's funny
Everybody friends, guess I wasn't lucky
Family full of athletes, I was kind of chubby
Shit was never sunny, wrists were sorta bloody
Lick my wounds with honey, save me for the vultures
I'm fallin' in the void, I don't know what I discover
I know I could hear the thunder, I can feel the hunters
They be preying on my hunger, I won't let 'em make me suffer 'cause

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy

[Outro: Joba]
Oooh, take a moment
Do you take a moment?
Do you take a moment?
Oooh, take a moment
Do you take a moment?
Do you take a moment?
