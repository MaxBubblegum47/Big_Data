Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
And if I had to do it all again
I would call you and tell you I loved you a little more
Now and then I think about you and I want to be your friend
Do you like the sound of that?

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Ice cold, I told you I'm ice cold
Find another way to put all these diamonds on
Lookin' through the window like, baby, I'm shinin', whoa
I know that you wish that I could come home
I almost [?], I wanna [?], yeah
I like to [?], you niggas is my [?], yeah
Fell like if time would froze, I feel like the mind and souls
It's too late and now it's time to go home

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
And if I had to do it all again
I would call you and tell you I loved you a little more
Now and then I think about you and I want to be your friend
Do you like the sound of that?

[Bridge]
Run while you can, little boy
Run while you can, little boy, it's a cruel cruel world
Run while you can, little boy
Run while you can, little boy, it's a cruel cruel world
I know, I know, I know

[Chorus]
And if I had to do it all again
I would call you and tell you I loved you a little more
Now and then I think about you and I want to be your friend
Do you like the sound of that?

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Mhh, I do, I do, I do like the sound of that
