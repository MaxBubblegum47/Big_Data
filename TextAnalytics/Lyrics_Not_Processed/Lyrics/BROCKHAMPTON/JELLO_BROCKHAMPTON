[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Hi, I live a wonderful life
Should've died twice, wonder who on my side
Life always better keepin' two on the side
Need no music when my niggas arrive
We be in Van Nuys
, black van with some white guys
Keep your hand out, waiting for the appropriate time
To ask a question like
"Could you perform at my best friend's birthday party?
With your friends and go crazy, just bring the shotty
Bring the loud one with the blonde hair."
Making out with Zayn in a lawn chair
They kicked me out but I belong here
Hear these songs nigga, see this long hair, 
see these videos
Direct these hoes with no budgets though
How the fuck did I land a fucking TV show?
Met all my friends through Kanye West and I ain't met him yet

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Just shaved down to the baby face
Clothes on me, guess it's Holiday
Fried, no sides at the restaurant
My sleep schedule like the power here, it's never on
Feeling like the past year a whole escapade (uh-oh)
Four cars, need a motherfucking Escalade
Pack it up like a clown car (honk, honk)
Bet you know my name from here to Hong Kong, bet I get along
Make some commas, karma, watch 'em sing along
Ayy, err, err, butter knife like dancing on a knuckle
In the thunder car, rocked up in the Lumma
Incidental, I be better by the summer
I be better by the winter, I be hoppin' in the rental
Maybe Tesla for all my missus sitting in the Volvo
Damn, shoot 'em down like, hmmm, sorry, do it all here

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I'm moonwalking on the sun hot
I used to live where the guns popped
Made some records then we moved out
Turned rap into the new pop
Bandana, I'm the new Pac
I been blowing up, I can't stop
They need my niggas in the White House
I do business with the white folks
Bring that money back to black folks
Flip it, stimulate the cash flow
Economic, but I speak ebonics
L.A. turned me to an asshole
I been shopping down on Melrose
Still a nigga but I'm livin' different
I been looking at the bigger picture
So I don't hear 'em when they talking to me

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
I just want a friend to fall in love with
Maybe someone I can binge drugs with
Living like a prince but I'm dove-less
Playin' my emotions, you a dumb bitch
Everybody talking on some gun shit
They don't even know where to bust it
Cry nigga, gotta fuckin' kick back
Gotta leave those soft niggas at the kickback
Splittin' all my problems like a Kit-Kat
I finessed the night that we slipped up
I could let you know where I'm next at
Tell my baby girl where the brakes at
You know I got number one pick stats
Catch me on the field, it's a mismatch
More like an eclipse, she couldn't miss that
Putting my ideas where my chips at

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down

[Outro: Joba]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da (La-di-da, la-di-da)
Do-walla, do-walla-walla, do-walla
La-di-da-di-da-di-da (La-di-da, la-di-da)
Do-walla, do-walla-walla, do-walla
La-di-da-di-da-di-da (La-di-da, la-di-da)
Do-walla, do-walla-walla, do-walla
