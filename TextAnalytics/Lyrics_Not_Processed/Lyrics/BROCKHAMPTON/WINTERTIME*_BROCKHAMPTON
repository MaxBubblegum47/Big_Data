Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I wanna minimize
I want a moment that end with time
I want a friend of mine to visit me like it's the wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
When I was Elio
Trippin’, I'm fuckin' up every code
Holdin’ my niggas 'till every broke
All of my brothers, I feel like I'm home

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Wintertime, wintertime
Remember when you were a friend of mine?
Remember when we couldn't get in line?
Now we the reason why they in the line
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
Contrary like the dew drops
In gray skies, I need new socks
'Cause I'm walkin' out with no shoes on
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
Contrary, platinum ring
One to ten, season feelings, no seasons
Wintertime, wintertime
The sky is fallin'
The sky is fallin’
That’s it

[Outro: bearface]
Baby, maybe you should let me go (Yeah, yeah)
When I'm alone, oh, I always feel right
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, oh, ooh
