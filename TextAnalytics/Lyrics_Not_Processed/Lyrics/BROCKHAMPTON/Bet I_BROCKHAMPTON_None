[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Smoking like five, six blunts in this bitch
My nigga Jon rollin' up, smoking heavy
Shout my nigga Jabari
I ain't been the same since my Grandma passed
Damn, damn
Ma ain't been the same since my Grandma passed
Damn, damn
She don't smoke weed to get high
Damn, damn
She only smoke dope 'cause her friends do it
Damn, damn

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
She don't give a fuck about no homework (She don't!)
She gone pop that pussy but give me dome first (I said!)
She pretend she love me until her throat hurt (She gon'!)
We gone need some rubbers and some more work (Ohh)
We be screaming like our TV don't work (Oh, oh)
Her Mama say to leave 'fore she disown her (Yeah, I'm on)
I don't blame her either took her from the church
Now watch me burn it down while I soul-search

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Now watch me, watch me while I burn it down

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
We be getting high, acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, we be getting high, oh, whoa

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
She only call me when she wanting to get high
Roll that weed, push them needles
Slide them panties to the side
Off that shit we gon' fuck through the night
Tight white skin, just the right fit for the night
Take another sip if you'd like
Another motherfucking bong rip if you like
You ain't going home for the night
Put you in that seat to the right
Coming home with me for the night
And I'ma get you high, take you places you ain't been
And never have to leave this spot
Melt here right here in the sky
And I can make it rain and watch it wash them sins away
So tell me, do you really feel lonely?
Waking up cold, you be calling out to hold me
To make you feel whole, just not so alone
Never let you go and we never coming down
And you ain't got no home, so we ain't got no problems
If all we need is drugs, then all you gotta do is call me
If all we need is love, then why is hate is what surround me?
Swallow all these down
And let these problems melt and drown me
Just drown me, just drown me

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Now watch me, watch me while I burn it down

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
We be getting high acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, we be getting high, oh, whoa

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
She done flipped the pharma
She done flipped 'em, she done flipped those
All I wanna know is where you, ooh, ooh
Powder shower, down on you (Down on you)
Know you sour, no sweets from you-ooh-ooh
Baby gon' fuck till the night finish
She gon' suck till the life in it
She probably gone bite till the blood hit it
Got some Polaroid nudes, put a knife in em
You a bad girl (Bad girl), bad habit
Bad girl (Bad girl), good finish
Bad girl, gon' get it, read a bad girl like book, what?
She throw it, throw it back like a hook, what?
See, I don't wanna tell em who I love, no (No, no, no)
She gonna hit me like a plug, whoa
All we gon do is fuck on the floor (Whoa)

another guy

Bitch came through, you know what I'm saying?
She was bad as shit, she was bad as shit
Man, I'm telling you, man
I'm telling you, yo
She had that nice ass on her and shit
But, yo, yo, yo, Tim, Tim, Tim, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen
Yo, yo, yo, tell me, tell, listen, listen
If she got that thing man I swear I think she got that jungle fever

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
Then I'm Tarzan, homie
, if she bleeding, tug it
Yeah I dropped my standards, my teachers aren't
Tryna flunk me down, they tryna hold me back
Fuck Kenan & Kel, man I ain't with All That
No, I ain't fight this hard since my Daddy put em up
I was hitting them trees in his big red truck
Came a long way from having my shirt tucked
And I still don't give a fuck, and I still don't give, uh, no I don't
Duct tape on my jeans, let it show, I'm a fuck up, let 'em know
I'm sorry, Mama, last time I cried was for my Grandmama
Could smell her like the flowers, Africana summer
