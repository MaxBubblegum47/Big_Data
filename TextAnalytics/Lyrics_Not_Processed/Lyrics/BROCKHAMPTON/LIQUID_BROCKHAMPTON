[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I grew up all alone, my mom and dad fighting
I moved around a lot, I did a lot of fighting
I met my friend Ian
, I seen a lot of cyphers
I did a lot of writing

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon & 
Kevin Abstract
]
Watch my uncles duck indictments
I'm used to ramen noodles, victims of mental illness
Products of neighborhoods with broken souls and wounded spirits
Don't judge me by appearance,
 
I moved to California
Started getting paid,
 
(Nigga, you broke)
 
shit's already boring

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Dash into the money like a hyphen, 
fuck a pipe dream, man
Had this shit when I was in my diapers
Burnin' through my diapers, hot shit, that was hot shit
Back when niggas looking for the Loch Ness

[Verse 4: Matt Champion & 
Dom McLennon
]
Stuck 'round dip spittin' assholes, make they mamas bashful
Got holes in my pockets so my shoes full of cash though
Cigar, Fidel Castro,
 
car full of Castrol
See the sunset when I backstroke, can't swim, but I could act, though

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends
Imagine having no friends, ayy
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends, ayy
Imagine having no friends, man
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends, ayy
Imagine having no friends, man
Ayy, ayy, imagine having no friends, man
