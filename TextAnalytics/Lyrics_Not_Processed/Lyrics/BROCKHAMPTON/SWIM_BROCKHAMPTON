[Intro: Joba]
We failed at a one night stand
I guess that should not matter
You were loved by another man
I guess that should not matter

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
You love to show out
Show your new outfit
You love to show out
When you leave the house
Your new outfit
I love it on you though

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
I love it on you, I love ya
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
(I love it on you) I love it on you, I love it on you
I love it on you, I love it on you, I love it

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood; w/ Kevin Abstract]
I came to California
I cannot afford this
I just want a fortune
I don't wanna pay no mortgage
I just want life for my kids
Damn, I ain't even have 'em yet
I'm ballin', and it don't stop
And it don't stop
I can see my life through the window glass
If I move with you, I don't need no cash
Had a dream last night that she loved me back
Keep God in my head, so a nigga bounced back
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Fell in love, but it ain't gon' last
Hydroplane like I ain't gon' crash
No frame with my face on glass
No rank when they check my class
Got a minute, got a second, got a day
Gotta get it, gotta find another way
I ain't tripping, I'm just feeling what I say
I ain't talking, I'm just spilling from my brain
Everybody think I got it figured out
Chasing sanity while niggas chasing clout
Show me love in the face of all doubts
That would tell me all I need to know about you
Ain't nobody gon' love you like me
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like me
Baby girl, I know we can save the world
So why you wanna fight me?

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You love to show out
Show your new outfit
I love it on you, I love it on ya
I love it on you, I love it on ya
I love it on you, I love it
