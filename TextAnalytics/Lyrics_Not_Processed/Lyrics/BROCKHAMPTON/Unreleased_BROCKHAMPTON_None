[Verse: Joba]
'Cause you're all I love
Yeah, you're all I dream about
'Cause you're all I love
Yeah, you're all, yeah, you are
'Cause you're all I love
Yeah, you're all I dream about
'Cause you're all I love
Yeah, you are, yeah, you are

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Walk before I get in
If my head's down well then my knees grown hair
Walk before I get in
If my head's down then I feel them stare
Oh, every day you got a problem with me
What I do to deserve that bullshit?
Like every bitch wanna fuck on me
I'm gay, what'd I do to deserve this?
Gimme that pussy, gimme that pussy
I wanna love your pussy, but I hate pussy
Don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay
I know you feel the way, I need you to wait, I need you to wait
Don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
I put it on like god hurt, drowning in all my woes
I never sang my shot, this soundin' like my chores
You won't know if I needed you, [?]
Got a taste and it just gets lighter
Need that head, then the more I'm broke
But you know that you're not helping
Girl, your body language is [?]
Got real something, I know that you a virgin
Yeah, why you do me like that?
Probably 'cause I'm feelin' on your booty like that
Gotta turn lights, keep it moving on track
I'm a [?] like that

[Verse: Ameer Vann]
It's like a hundred bitches on my phone, nigga, I don’t spend the night
I just left your house and I’m on the way, this my third stop tonight
But you're the first one I call, you could always make it right
All the things I can say, I'm a different kind of nigga
I need Broadway lights, I need eight gold figures
I need money, keep the fame, I need pussy, keep the love
Watered lean, it's the same, I need Jesus up above
I need seven more days and I need fuckin' more nights
'Cause I don't know the right way and my mind ain't right
So I smoke and pray about it, I don't sleep through the night
I need more, I need, wait a minute

[Verse: Jesse Rutherford]
Oh, I'm in the zone, give me that flow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's just an illusion, sorry for confusing you
I don't usually do this, I don't want him using you
Get it off my mind, baby (Ooo, ooo)
Mhm, I'm so tired of wasting time, babe
I got so much more to do, yeah
Huh, I'm singing "yeah, yeah, hallelujah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know I had to go and keep the flow real quick
Jesse get up in the morning and he gotta take the flow real quick
Like phantom on me, like shining on me, so bright all the time
Haha, huh, and it sound like I checked my sight on my right
But I don’t even do that
Jesse be like “Who that?”
Jesse be like “Who that?”
I’m not talking 'bout J. Cole
Jesse sound like a date hoe
Jesse twist sayin' everything
Jesse switchin' like a hundred lanes
Skrt, skrt past the boom, motherfucker
Jesse sound like a fuckin' [?], motherfucker
Coming straight right out the blue, motherfucker
Brockhampton the crew, motherfucker
Yeah, he's so cute, motherfucker
Like Cupid, like Betty Boop, motherfucker
