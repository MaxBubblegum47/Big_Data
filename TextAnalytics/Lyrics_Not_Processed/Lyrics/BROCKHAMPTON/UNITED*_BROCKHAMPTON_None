[Lyrics from Snippet/Documentary]

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
The purest color is achieved by using just one
Wavelength, at a high intensity
Such as in, laser lights

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Laser lights (laser lights)
Laser light
The intensity drops
Back when SATURATION drops

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
-nails, clothes, we’re perfect
We’re perfect
Hair, eyes, nails, clothes, we’re perfect
We’re perfect
Hair, eyes, nails, clothes, we’re perfect
We’re perfect
Hair, eyes, nails, clothes, we’re perfect
We’re perfect
Hair, eyes, nails, clothes, we’re perfect
We’re perfect
