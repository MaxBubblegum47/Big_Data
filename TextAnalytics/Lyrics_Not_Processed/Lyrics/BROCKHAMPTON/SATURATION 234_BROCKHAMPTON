[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I'm a felon, watch me film it
Bad baby, watermelon in her denim
Like the brother from Miami
White powder, tell his bros, know I'm 'bouta
Tell them I was ready, right now I be ready (boy got it!)
Take a head, put it through the public housing (break my body)
Pay for it with my own tax dollars (I don't want it)
Pay for killing brothers been (Merlyn Merlyn)

[Hook: Matt Champion]
Boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'ma keep my distance from the cowards
I done put in twenty thousand hours
I don't want your co-sign for the hour
Everything is sweet while niggas sour
They don't know about a nigga's story
They could love me in the moment, in the future they'll ignore me
What ya doin' for me, huh?
I don't think them niggas seem to recognize
Cutting through the crap like I got pesticides, weaponize

[Verse 3: Joba]
What have I told you? I know who I am
(You can't tell me shit)
People are pointing their fingers at me
(I'm not the one to play with)
White flags, fly so free
(You can't tell me shit)
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down for me
(I'm not one to play with)
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down for me

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I always pay in cash, so I ain't got no credit
I'ma need a co-signer if you're tryna get it
Moved up out the house, close my bank account
They couldn't fill my check, I need to buy a jet
I ain't been the same since Viceland paid
See me on the screen, my million dollar face
My momma told me I was gonna be a star, yeah
I paid the debt and then I went a bought a car, yeah
