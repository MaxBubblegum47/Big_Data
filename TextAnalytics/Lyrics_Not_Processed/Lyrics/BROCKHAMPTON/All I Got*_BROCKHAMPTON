Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Ready (Ready)
Go (C'mon)
Ready
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
How you read my mind better than me?
Yeah, you know I need you when I'm asleep (
Ready
)
I used to dream of a dream, you know I'm dreamin' that dream
Now my pockets too deep, I don't struggle these days
Yeah, I'm on TLC
Yeah, I'm stuck in my ways, I'm like a broken LP
Yeah it's most of the ways so we could all be free (
Ready
)
I'm a slave to these ways, dawg
I'm a passer go and wait to hear my plays, dawg
Used to run around the block, with the homies
Ding dong ditchin', takin' rich niggas' money (
Ready
)
Ain't a damn thing funny, used to dream of bein' Puppy
Bein' ugly ain't made me no money yet (
Go, c'mon
)
My music was soundin' crazier than 100 gecs
In the tavern, I be dreamin' 'bout gettin' back (
Ready
)
I was a loser, baby, so why didn't you kill me?
The record's dishonest, boy, so that's why they feel me
I'm still in this building 'til we on this motherfucker
Just a lonely motherfucker, I don't trust you motherfuckers (
Ready
)
On the speedboat, lookin' like a cozy motherfucker
So show off all your bodies, I ain't no phony motherfucker now
What's the real? (Yeah) Why you still here? (Yeah)
How you still hear? (Yeah) You boys shoulda been gone (
Ready
)
You thought I'd stop at fifteen, just the fall off
Freshman, BH, aight, nigga, that's all I got (Ayy)
