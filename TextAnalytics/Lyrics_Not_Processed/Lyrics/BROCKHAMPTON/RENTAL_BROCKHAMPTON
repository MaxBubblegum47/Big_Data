[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I need it all downtown, nigga
Put it back where you fuckin' found it though
I need it all down (my nigga)
Keep 'em right there, oh, you found 'em though
I want a shirt that make my body feel all sexy
I want a chain that make my body feel all hefty
I want my head to fall off when I walk out the door
I want the rain to fall down and I'm askin' for more

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I want a love that make me feel like I ain't breakin' ya heart
I wanna know what made you stay
When it was wrong from the start
I need to know where you went lookin'
Where you went through the chart
I need this fear of being everybody else to depart
I got a lot on my mind, not enough hours to shed
Not enough trust to believe, not enough feelin' to care
I'm feeling numb to the world so I've been ignoring instead
I'm seeing through what I wanted, to recognize who is there, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Coming top down by the seaside
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
See the road sign on the 45
Only you and me by the borderline (ooh)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah, let it go

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
And I will show you off for everything I own
I know it's not what you're used to
See they could tear me down, take everything I made
I'll still be here next to you

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Coming top down by the seaside
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
See the wrong side of the 45
Only you and me by the borderline (ooo)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah (ooo-ooo)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah, let it go

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
