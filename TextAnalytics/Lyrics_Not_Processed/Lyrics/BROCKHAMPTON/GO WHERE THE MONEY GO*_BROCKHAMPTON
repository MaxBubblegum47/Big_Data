Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
I go where the money go
Go where the money go (Bang, bang, cash)
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
I go where the money go
Go-go where the money go
Bang, bang, cash
Give me the bag
Why you see me laugh
Pass me plastic bag
Bang, bang, cash
Give me the bag
Why you see me laugh
Pass me plastic bag

[Verse: Matt Champion]
You somebody like nobody look back though
They just jealous off the Xannys...
