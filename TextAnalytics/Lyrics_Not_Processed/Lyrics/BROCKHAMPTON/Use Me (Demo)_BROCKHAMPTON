[Intro]
Use me for your service (For your service)
Here am I, Lord

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas was in that back room
See, I ain't sitting with that
Niggas was hitting that glass tube
Yeah, I ain't fuckin' with that
Auntie was smoking that crack too
My mama was dealin' with that
Big skies out in Corpus
Them lights was so gorgeous
In the garage, I made a fortune
I'm still tryna fuck every Mormon
It's amazing how I'm still searching, y'all
Still reaching, man, fuck the law
Above the law, she above the law
Close the blinds, let the lights go off
Duck low in case they raid us all
And take it all with speed and ease
He like me on my knees
Generational trauma things
I wonder how far I could bring
This shit to my existence, my nigga
Can I get a witness? I lived it
Turn into a vicious, I spit it
Looked at me and rip it, just get it

[Bridge]
You ain't the only one that's searching for that 1-9
You gotta go ahead and let that sun shine

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Everything gon' be okay
I'm 'bout to steal a whip and drive that bitch to Montana
My feelings roll, that's when I throw tantrum
LA, LA, LA road
Everything gon' be okay
I'm 'bout to steal a whip and drive that bitch to Montana
My feelings roll, that's when I throw tantrum
LA, LA, LA road

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I left some ghosts in my mama house
Standing alone with the shell of my past
I probably still should be underground
I know that nobody thought this would last
It's been bigger than the music
When it hits you feel it you don't have to try
Why would I care for your validation
When you couldn't look me in the eyes
Clutching your purse in elevators
But I wrote your income off on my taxes
They don't want a social commentator
They just wanna hear a nigga rapping
You start to feel a bit of freedom
Then they wanna stop and frisk you in the boardroom
Everybody wanna tell you what you're worth
Until you know your worth and then they can't ignore you
Wait a minute for what you pray for
Halle Salassie, Halleluja
Word to Buddha, Insha'Alla
I've been falling back into the void
Somewhere in-between overjoyed and annoyed
And I can't feel a fuckin' thing
Take a moment just to blink
Take a breath, let it think
Wash my hands, let 'em sink
