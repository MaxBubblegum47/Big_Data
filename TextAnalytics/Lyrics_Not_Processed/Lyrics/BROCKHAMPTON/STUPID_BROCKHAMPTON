[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
MERLYN! Hopping out the vehicle, I feel like Batman
Hanging with directors, 'bout that action
So please don't stick-and-move in my direction
All I got to lose is my erection

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann & 
Matt Champion
]
I'm a Black man with a deadly weapon
(
What drug reference, huh?
)
I'm a real dog, we all go to heaven
But I been tripping on the steps, and I don't think I'll make it
I'm in this big house, still, I'm suffocating

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Carnival, 
my heart like a Supreme Phantom
Going hundred speed, blowin' steam, I throw a tantrum
Judging by my face, my eyes slit like a python
I think she might hate me for a lifetime, ayy, ayy
Daddy cracking redrum
, blueprint for the pipeline
Going out the weather, leave my name, I'm goin' offline
I just want my shit to fit, tailored just like Tiffany
Oh, they say I'm perfect, on my back, oh, man, they killing me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & 
Merlyn Wood
]
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(
Wha-wha, aqua, for my
)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(
Wha-wha, aqua, for my
)
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(
Wha-wha, aqua, for my
)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(
Wha-wha, aqua, for my
)

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
White burner, black burner, I do not discriminate
I am on a pilgrimage so don't try to insinuate
Building up an instrument to aim it at the human race
Let it off in hopes that all the pain and stress disintegrates
I think you intolerant, when you do the most it's moderate
I come with that gas that'll make you think I had a doctorate
What we do provocative, I ain't no apologist
Don't step to professionals if you still move like novices

[Verse 5: Kevin Abstract]
America's favorite, I do my best and they hate it
It's like I'm stuck in the matrix and I'm stuck losin' patience
While they stuck on they day shift, I hate my boyfriend's fragrance
I'm a faggot, I say it, I scream that shit like I mean it
Yeah, I'm ugly and genius
I went from nothing to sleeping on Jon's couch
To makin' people bounce at every show that's sold out
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout, with ghouls all in my dirty mouth
Boys be on that silly shit, so Billy 'bout to air 'em out

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & 
Merlyn Wood
]
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(
Wha-wha, aqua, for my
)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(
Wha-wha, aqua, for my
)
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(
Wha-wha, aqua, for my
)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(
Wha-wha, aqua, for my
)
