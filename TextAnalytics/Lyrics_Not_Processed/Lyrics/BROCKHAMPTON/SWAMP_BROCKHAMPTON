[Video Intro: Ameer Vann & Robert Ontenient]
I could be here all day. You're gonna tell me what I need to know. You're gonna tell me! Are you gonna tell me? C'mon, spit it out...
Me Ilamo Roberto, y este es el camino al Ã©xito.

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
My daddy taught me how to sell dope
Turn grams into elbows
Light it up when the L rolled
Black mask, used to kick doors
Wasn't no bullets in the guns though
Niggas still never argued
Raid the house like the task force
Me and my niggas like drug dogs
Find the dope then we take off
Fuck my girl with my chain on
Then she tatted my name on it
Yellowstone, I was raised on it
Actavis in my baby bottle
Baby stroller was an Impala
Niggas like to talk down on me
When I see 'em, I don't hear about it

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
(Merlyn! Merlyn!)
Never would've met my friends if not for satellites
Yeah, I'll cuff her even if she do not suck me right (suck me, suck me!)
Always planned to be a rapper when I failed at life
Luckily professor failed me at the proper time (yee! yee!)
Shh-shh, shh, I say "please" all the time, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, I like white collar crime, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, money digital broke and
Shh-shh, shh, Ghana prince in your messages

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I know you hate me for leavin'
Then let's go crazy together
When I tell ya all the things that I'm thinking
Just so that we could get better
But you wanna put my heart on the stretcher
I don't got insurance for this pressure
Wanna find the benefits, I can't measure
Trying not to run out on my temper
I can see the ash and the ember
That was made from emotional texture
I don't know why I took this endeavor
Don't identify with oppressors
Don't identify with surrender
All of my old friends fair-weather
Gotta treat my heart like a treasure
'Cause all I know is no one else will

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?

[Verse 4: Joba]
You do not know me, don't speak of my homies, you are a phony
Quit pinnin' shit on me, you gon' bring out the old me
You don't wanna know what I wanna do when y'all talk down on my name
I don't wanna see you in the street 'cause I might catch a case
People smile when they face to face (woo, woo, woo!)
Then turn their back and switch up words you say (ah, ah, ah!)
Running to the papers everyday (woo, woo, woo!)
I'm running to the paper anyway (ah, ah, ah!)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Matt Champion]
Fucking commas up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
Fu-fucking dollars up from the outside
From the outside, from the outside
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
They been talkin' down on me (huh) what ya say?
