[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
(Everything that's perfect, damn)
You're everything that's perfect, damn

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I know who you are
I know the type of niggas you let in your car
I know I'm not special babe
I know everything you hate
The freckles on your fuckin' face
Makes the most sense to me

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
(Everything that's perfect, damn)
You're everything that's perfect, damn

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Two, O, O, seven
Two, O, O, eight
Two, O, O, nine
You, I can't relate
You, a different place
You, a different space
You, I hesitate, for you I never wait
Never wait

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
(Everything that's perfect, damn)
You're everything that's perfect, damn
