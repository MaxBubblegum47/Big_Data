[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
See, I've been trippin' and fallin'
No more slippin' and stallin'
Got no numbers I'm callin'
Just wanna be in the coffin
All this trouble we've been causin'
Benz I'm crossin', I've been saucin'
Exercising my endorphins
Since you told me you were walkin'
I've been searchin', huntin', crawlin'
What's it costin' me? It ain't doing much
Tossin' me through a loop
I hush the voices in my head
For a minute so I can listen to you
And all I heard was
"I ain't listening", shit is cripplin'

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas on that word of mouth 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
Niggas on that word of mouth 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
Niggas on that word of mouth 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
Niggas on that word of mouth 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I got rubbers in my pocket, niggas like to gossip
If I need to drop 'em, let me know
'Cause I don't do much talkin', unless it's 'bout the money
If you got an offer, let me know
I was sellin cabbage, until I moved to Cali
Money in a mattress on the floor
Until I messed with niggas with fingers on the trigger
We was runnin', kickin' in the doors

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas on that word of mouth til' they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I use protection, my nigga, so fuck your lecture, my nigga
And fuck yo' section, my nigga, I got the rest of my niggas
My niggas rushed on my niggas, 
my niggas love all they niggas
I fell in love with that nigga
, that nigga skipped out the picture
