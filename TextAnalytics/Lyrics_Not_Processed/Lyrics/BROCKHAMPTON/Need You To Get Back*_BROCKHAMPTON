Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Tech-Techinical

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Get you immersed with and burst your bubble
The trouble that we be surfin' through
It hurts to choose, I gotta face the truth
My brother face the judge, I can't face the drugs
And corporates dogs, man, they lace the drugs
Just don't be a weirdo unless it's natural
Like my dreads and my bed, so lonely
Thank God for the homies
Thank God for the groceries that you brought through
'Cause we was gettin' hungry, niggas know that I'm a lot to
I got a lot to lose, when the pressure's on, the light's cool
The box is new, ain't nobody watchin' you
So how could we be robbin' you?
I make more thank you think, I think more than you think
If I keep goin' at this rate, I'll be your brain next week
I moved on in my sleep, I got it done in a week
Been possessed by my old self
Fuckin' with the Devil got me fuckin' hella old still
Money that I owed still, my father paid his phone bill
(That's his karma comin' back)
'Cause I ain't seen his crib still, I ain't met his kids still
I'm tryna have a kid still
Ayy, yo

[Break: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
Need ya, need ya to get back
Need ya, need ya to get (I need you to)
Need ya, need ya to get back
Need ya, need ya to get, I need you to need me
Get back, finding to get physical
Want this to be easy, get back
'Cause you know that easy come and easy go
Need ya, need ya to get, I need you to need me
Get back, finding to get physical
Want this to be easy, get back
'Cause you know that easy come and easy go

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Get back
Get, get, get, get
Back, back, back, back
Get, get, get, get
