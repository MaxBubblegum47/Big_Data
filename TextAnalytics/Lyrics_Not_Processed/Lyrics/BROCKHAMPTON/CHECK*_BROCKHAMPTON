[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Stop 'em all in the projects
Niggas taking our profit
Niggas talking for profit
I'm a prophet, that's [?]
A boyfriend, that's toxic
I want them to stop it
Took a sip and I hopped in
Fucked on my white friends
And learned from my black ones
Yo, I'm definitely my dad's son
With the soul of a Jackson
And the [?] of a Jordan
They rob my nigga for Jordans

[?]

[?] the bleach, plaque golden

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Need me a check
Nigga I need me a check
See how they puttin' my kin in some checks?
See how they puttin' ideas in my head?
I don't understand, go with the plan
Look at my poems, look at my hands
Look at the set, [?]
Dreaming is cursed, [?]
Need me a, need me a, need me a check

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]

[?]
What should believe me
These niggas is demons and [?]
They made a deal with the devil
Had LA on [?]
Stick to your truth cause it's all that you got
In this world full of demon scum

[?]

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Imma keep the bill for a wild one

[?] it's been a wild run

[?] some outcome
All I know is
You a bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch
