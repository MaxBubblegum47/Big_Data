[Verse 1: bearface]
Anyway, I ain't much for the cold
In your car, I felt lost
Cut her legs covered in scars
And erase my doubts for long

[Verse 2: bearface]
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind

[Verse 3: bearface]
Say you've lost your way and come to ask the way out soon
You always knew
Please don't stay far, I wish for more
With you
