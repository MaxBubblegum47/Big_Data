[Intro: Joba]
Angels watchin' over me, god damn
Hope the homies rest in peace, I can't
As I sink into concrete
I throw a prayer to the old me

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Twenty-five, they said twenty-five, no P.O. in sight, he just turned eighteen
Sun shinin' when they hit my cousin, it was like a month past MLK Day
Swear some nights I see him 'tween the shadows and the smoke, mane
God could watch me sin, he turned away from all my flaws, mane

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
.45, he got a .45 and I pray to God he don't bring it, man
Sunset, just another Texan, and that last semester ain't mean a thing
Everything that's evil make me feel alive
Know my niggas on the Southside got my back tonight

[Break: Kevin Abstract]
If you want it, I got it, you want it, I got it
Can you tell that I'm high? (Ooh, ooh)
If you want it, I got it, you want it, I got it, now (High, high)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Kevin Abstract & Jabari Manwa]
Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
Talk down and get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the real still here, what you say? We don't care, yeah, ayy
Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Talk down and get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
And the real still here, what you say? We don't care

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Where my four-four? Where my po-po?
Po-po said can't have more, they say, "I got no drawers"
They say, "drum and you draw" They say, "drum and you lose"
They say, "drum and gun toss", I was very confused
I got friends that kill, I got friends that died
I got many woes, I got many wives
I got enemies, and I roll the dice, ayy-yeah, ayy-yeah-yeah
I got enemies, ayy-yeah, ayy-yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Kevin Abstract & Jabari Manwa]
Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
Talk down and get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the real still here, what you say? We don't care, yeah, ayy
Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Talk down and get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
And the real still here, what you say? We don't care

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
Bendin' round the corner, no sleep, I
Only feel good in my jeans, I
Never got some esteem, ah
I'ma go and get my cheese, high
I'ma just smoke with me, high
Never gon' set me free, ah

[Bridge: bearface]
It's you, love
It's true, love
(It's you, love) Hair down, wash it out
Fuck me up, oh my God (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(It's true, love) Low down, come around
When I see it, you gon' make me (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(It's you, love) Hair down, wash it out
Fuck me up, oh my God (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(It's true, love) Low down, come around
When I see it, you gon' make me (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Outro: bearface, Joba & Jabari Manwa]
It's you, love (It's true, what?)
It's true, love (It's true, what?)
It's you, it's you, love
It's true, love, it's true, love
It's you, love
It's true, true, true, love, true, love
It's true, love, it's true, love
