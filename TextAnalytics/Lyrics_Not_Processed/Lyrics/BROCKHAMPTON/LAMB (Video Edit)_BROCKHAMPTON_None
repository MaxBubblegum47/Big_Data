[Video Intro: Robert Ontenient]
Me llamo Roberto
Y esta es mi familia

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Let me share your couch with you
I thank you for that
You let me wipe my mouth with you
I thank you for that

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

[Verse: Matt Champion]
Better not, better not, better not
Get too dark please
You should call, you should call, you should call
On me to eat
Even when, even when, even when
Night skies bug me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud
What happened to my niggas that I had to pray for
Hands in the dirt, break a little more
Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah
I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy
It's so mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy
