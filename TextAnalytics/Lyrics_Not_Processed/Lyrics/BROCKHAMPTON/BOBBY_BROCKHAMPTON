[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
My decisions, I ain't sure if they the right ones
My daddy used to beat my mommy, I would fight him
But I been thinkin' that I'm kinda just like him
I take a sip and then I go and grab a knife and
I take a drive while I'm high, suspend my license
I'm hanging out the window speedin' on the I-10
I'm headed west, out to Hollywood with my friends
I'm moving out and I don't care if you like it
'Cause I've been sleeping on the roaches, I don't like this
I'm going platinum, then I'm going buy a island
I'm in that water to the creases in my eyelids
I'm out in Austin, I got work on consignment
I met some niggas that was runnin' in apartments
Take the money, take the weed into the darkness
I turned heartless, the barrel barkin'
I break commandments Moses put on stone carvings

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I did business with a homie, now he trippin' 'bout some money
Partially, mainly trippin' 'bout percentages he wanted
Made the trip to California, made the album of a lifetime
Fuck this boyband shit, I just want a life line
I just want my mom back, my sister in a Cadillac
The black, she had the rims to match, the Twitter fuckin' pillow mat
I am not an activist, just because I like dick
Nigga, my existence is enough to end all this shit
I be studyin', 'lotta music coming out that I ain't
Fuckin' with, shit that we makin' sound like Southside
Dungeon shit, we the new Motown
Thugs with no guns 'round, friendship is gangsta

[Outro: Matt Champion]
All my life, I been runnin' with the wrong one
One slip up and I end up in the coffin
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
All my life, I been runnin' with the wrong one
One slip up, and I end up in the coffin
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
Holdin' on my motherfuckin' pride
