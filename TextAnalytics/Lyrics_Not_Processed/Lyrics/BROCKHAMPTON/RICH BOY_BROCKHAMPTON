Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Matt Champion]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse: Matt Champion]
'Round the clock, 'cause anyone could be right on your back
No problem, bruh
Life'll never give you that, you gotta corral 'em up
The world don't shed a tear when the past erupt
Shit, you got in any drama, keep my head low
Better build a empire 'till they see me glow
She get money like (Aw)
She get money like (Aw)
She get money like (Aw)
She get money like
Make a band, make a grand
Make a hunnid, middle man
They gon' hate, they gon' style
Take your blessing, bite the child

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
Bitch boy, rich boy
Baby just want a rich boy
Rich boy, rich boy
Baby just want a pocket full of cash
Want a pocket full of cash
