[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Hallelujah, holy lion‚ word to Judas
How I'm supposed to‚ (Hey) trust what you say is the truest? (Right)
Haile Selassie‚ (Uh) insha'Allah if I gotta (Woo)
Spin my words around as if you wanted a mandala for Nirvana
Singin' a sonata towards our karma
Did a rain dance, bringin' commas from Tacoma to Oaxaca
I got spirits in my heart that make my mind move like it's water
Flow into the moment and avoid the melodrama
Gotta breathe for a second
Can't believe anybody still testin'
My whole team is a force to be reckoned with
Operatin' like specialists
One to the two to the who are you?
Sendin' out projections with prejudice
My attention to detail is in scale with classic impressionists
So the lesson is that prerequisites are irrelevant to my standards (Right)
It's a deficit in your settlement, you better learn to mind all your manners (Right)
My whole troop been goin' bananas
Try and step inside of our jungle (Right)
You can try to take all your chances
We won't help your ass if you stumble‚ nigga (Right)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out
'Stead of feelin' trippy, dawg
You need to help your city out
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out
'Stead of feelin' trippy, dawg
You need to help your city out

[Post-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Couple...
Couple...
Couple...
Couple bands'll‚ couple bands'll—
Couple...
Couple...
Couple bands'll send 'em out
Couple bands'll, couple bands'll—

[Verse 2: Matt Champion and 
Merlyn Wood
]
Watch your back, (Ayy) don't leave your door cracked (Yeah, yeah)
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse (Yeah)
Watch your back, (What?) don't leave your door cracked (Woohoo)
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse (
If you, if you, if you, if you
, hey)

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
If you want a feature, we can figure it out
Want a color for your album? We can figure it out
How you not invite the boys who colored your rollout
Then you copy-paste hard work from the BH house?
I always got somethin' to say when you take food from my mouth
I begged my mommy for money until the day it ran out
They say, "We helped you when and when, now you should figure it out"
Figure it out

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out
'Stead of feelin' trippy, dawg
You need to help your city out
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out
'Stead of feelin' trippy, dawg
You need to help your city out

[Post-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Couple...
Couple...
Couple...
Couple bands'll, couple bands'll—
Couple...
Couple...
Couple bands'll send 'em out
Couple bands'll, couple bands'll—

[Verse 4: Joba]
Waste your breath, watch the tone though
Take you to the dojo
Roll up my doja, sticky fingers
At the door, bruh, Jehovah, you ho bitch
Witness sadistic shit, will come again
Next time I take my belt off, spank you
Bad kid, bad seed, not me, got beef
I leave body, blackout from rage
Childproof my pockets, don't need the options
Romanticizing what I do if I ain't stop me
Can be off me, tread lightly

[Bridge]
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I'm tired of making a fool out of me and you
Is there anything that I can do that'll save us, baby?
Is there anybody lovin' lies and robbin' shotties
45's and still alive, and no drunk drivin'
That's how they killed my brother
(
Walking with Jesus

You know, you know better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better, better, better, bet on it
Better bet on it, better bet on it, hey
(
Walking with Jesus
)
You know, you know better
Better, better, better, bet, bet on it
Bet on it, ayy, ayy, yeah
Ayy, yeah
I wanna sing, I wanna
I wanna sing, ooh
(
Just tell 'em, tell 'em that
)
Ah, cool

Walking with Jesus Christ

Walking with the Lord
