[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Something about him
His car ain't nice and flashy (Yeah, yeah)
There’s something about him
Yeah, his attitude is like magic (Yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
I know I got to have it
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
I really like how you do all the things that you do
I really like how you say all the things that you say (I love him!)
I really like how you do all the things you could do
I really like all the things that you really could say, ayy
I really like how you move when you're out by yourself
I really like all your crew and you can take ’em to hell
Boy, don't you know I fucking got you? Right, right

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
There's something about him
His car ain't nice and flashy (Yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
Yeah, his attitude is like magic (Yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
I know I got to have it
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I love him, I love him
Something about him
