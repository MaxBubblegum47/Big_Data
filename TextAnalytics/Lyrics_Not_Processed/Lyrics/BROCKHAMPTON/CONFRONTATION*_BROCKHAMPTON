Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Matt Champion]
Motherfuckers actin' flagrant, yeah
Streetball, no NBA shit, yeah
Seein' double, heard the mumbles all around
Rides gettin' out the days, yeah, yeah
I would think you're outta pocket
Switchin' up on all your topics
Eyes just side to side
Mighta stepped, you ain't like confrontation
