Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Good mornin', we lookin' for a function
I know you niggas love to push my buttons
Tell the Lord to call me back
Tell Ferg to hit me back, and it'll be a rap
I know my niggas still waitin' on “BANKROLL"
And the album almost done, it's on the way, though
It's like the days we was singin' about Waco
Gotta get it right, so baby, wait though
San Marcos, couldn't afford no queso
I praise to Allah 'cause we all got some pesos
Compose the history like Beethoven
I throw in the moon, what's the froze and the fresh
Just be hopin', we golden, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Are the lights on? I can't find you
This is our song, this is our song
Got my hands up, got my head down
All my tears fall on the dance floor
To our song

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Look how I'm feelin', shakin' it down like that
Nobody comes close to the spot you used to have
Everyone here wants you, yeah, they want what you have
I know that you don't see it, that's what I like about you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's what I like about you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's what I like about you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Are the lights, lights, lights

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Are the lights on? I can't find you
This is our song, this is our song
Got my hands up, got my head down
All my tears fall on the dance floor
To our song

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
All of my– (Yeah), all of my– (Yeah)
All of my– (Yeah), all of my– (Yeah)
Taken for weak, taken for weak
Taken for weak, taken for weak
All of my– (Yeah), all of my– (Yeah)
All of my– (Yeah), all of my– (Yeah)
Taken for weak, taken for weak
Taken for weak, taken for weak
