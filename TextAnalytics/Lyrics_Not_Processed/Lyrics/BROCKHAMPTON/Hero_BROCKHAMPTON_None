[Verse 1: Rodney Tenor]
I'm sorta back, I'll quarterback yo' side chick
Hut, hut, one hike bitch, don't hide her, I'll find it
Hit it once then rewind it, hit it twice, then get blinded
We get blunted, I don't trust em, and I don't act like I love em
I finally finish, she finally famous
I finally did it, I found me a stranger
I took her to dinner, and then I got in it
I told her she ain't shit and then she replaced me
With some other nigga, she told me she hate how I roll
Better than dragging this chick on the road (road, road, road)
Better than taking this chick to my show
Get straight, keep pace or keep space from my face
No taste, a lot of ladies is sixth place
Type to get misplaced, drunk, and throwed
Shawty was getting old, and she ain't know that I was cold
And she always wanted more
Click, clack, boom, bap, goes the beat
When I can't keep shawty on her feet

[Bridge: Joba]
No more tears
No more fears
No more years
To waste on thoughts unclear

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more
Treat me so bad, fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more
Treat me so bad, fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
You can't wait for love, that shit don't last forever
I can’t wait for you, that shit don’t last forever
I know you well, know you better than yourself
Know your ins and outs and curves
You swerving straight into your house
You know my name (know my name)
Say my name, touch yourself
We got issues (we got issues)
Know your frame, know your game
We got issues (we got issues)
Know I’m lame, know you same
We got issues (still got issues)
Keep it strange, no to blame
Fuck you and your shit
Swear you burn like matches' tip
Swear you fucked like half these kids
How'd I love on such a bitch?
Shoulda fucked up on your cousin
She look good even with black eyes
Next time that you say you love me
Baby I'll just ask why, yeah

[Bridge: Joba]
No more tears
No more fears
No more years
To waste on thoughts unclear

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more
Treat me so bad, fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more
Treat me so bad, fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
She put her whole spirit in it
She put her whole spirit in it
She run around and keep her whole spirit in it
She put her whole spirit in it
She turn around, she let the whole squad hit it
She let the whole squad hit it
She turn around, she let the whole squad hit it
She let the whole squad hit it
Ain't that a bitch? Face down that bitch
She turn around, disrespect that bitch
Ain't that a bitch? Face down that bitch
She turn around, disrespect that bitch

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more
Treat me so bad, fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more
Treat me so bad, fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need you, you don't need me, I need you more
Fuck me so good, treat me so bad
Oh yeah that's love, you need a
You need a hero
I don't need you, you don't need me, I need you more
Fuck me so good, treat me so bad
Oh yeah that's love, you need a
You need a hero
You need a hero
