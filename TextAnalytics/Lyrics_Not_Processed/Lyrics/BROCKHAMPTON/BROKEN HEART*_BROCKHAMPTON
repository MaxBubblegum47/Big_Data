[Verse 1: JOBA]
A broken heart is the [?]

[?]
I can't complain
No one to blame, I am sensitive [?]
Forgive me for my feelings
But when I got that feeling
I'm way too supersticious
Let me know where I went wrong
And maybe we could [?]
Have been all on my own

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Hey, don't waste another minute
Gotta get the bag and then I'm in it

[?] and we finish
No way, no way
Cause no matter how [?]
Imma get all of your [?]
Imma be in love, Imma be in love, someday
{Post-Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Someday, someday yeah, someday yeah
(Someday) Imma get it
(Someday) Imma get it
(Someday) Imma get it
Someday

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
She goes [?]

[?]

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
So I go
I just want you to know
I love my people back home
But I gotta take it slow
Never take it slow
