[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
You fired, you fired (For Joie!)
Shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot
Shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot
Shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot
Shawty shot me out the atmosphere, well this one year
I was flyin' high in the pimp plane atmosphere
Shy, shawty, shawty shy, shawty shy, shawty, shawty shy
Shawty, shawty shy, shawty shy, shawty, shawty shy
Shawty, shawty shot me out the sky, well this one year
I was flyin' high in the pimp plane atmosphere

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood & Kevin Abstract]
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora, come home, you been searchin' too long

[Verse 1: Rodney Tenor]
Shit, high-waist jeans with a kid
Shorty always flexin' on the 'gram
Tight, tight jeans with a rack make me go on a rant
Shawty, but your attitude rank
Drunk at the club with your girls only here for the drinks
Untouchable data, unmeasurable playa'
God, the moderator, I ain't sayin', I'm hittin'
I was just wondering if I could call at your number
If I was ever in trouble, if I could take you home
I ain't a doper, you ain't a smoker
I'm hopin' to get to know you
I'm wonderin' if I could get you gone, girl
I was lookin' for ride-or-dies
And there you came through
With your fine disguise, yeah, yeah
I ain't fuckin' around no more
Don't hear me, all she hear was sha-la-la-la

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood & Kevin Abstract]
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora, come home, you been searchin' too long

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
We all gonna die one day, man ain't that crazy? (that cray)
She said thats an odd way convince me to be your lady
That be why you bae, but you is not my baby
I met these three black girls: Ocian, Jurnee, and Mercedes
One's a queen, one's narcoleptic, and one is crazy
Pickin' one lover's just like pickin' one daisy
I need at least a dozen in my DMs on the daily
Why get your nose stuck in one when you can sniff the bouquet?

[Outro: Joba]
La, la, la, la, ooo-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, ooo-la, la, la, la-ah
La, la, la, la, ooo-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, ooo-la, la, la, la-ah
La, la, la, la, (baba-bum-bum) ooo-la, la, la, la (bad-a-bum-bum)
La, la, la, la, (baba-bum-bum) ooo-la, la, la, la (bad-a-bum-bum)
La, la, la, la, (ba-ba) ooo-la, la, la, la (ba-ba, ba-ba)
