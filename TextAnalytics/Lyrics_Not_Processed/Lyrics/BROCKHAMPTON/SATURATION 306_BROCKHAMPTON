[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You ain't shit to me
I'll break a nigga head before I leave
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap
You ain't shit to me
I'll break a nigga head before I leave
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap
You ain't shit to me
I'll break a nigga head before I leave
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap

[Verse: Merlyn Wood]
Coming from a hard place, I'm a resident
What they do right, had my life with embellishment
Representing shit my Instagram I always say
Talking reckless, my brain spin faster than that shit

[Outro]
Find me useless
