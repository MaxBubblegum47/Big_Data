Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: bearface & 
Kevin Abstract
]
Who's gonna find out? (I just know you understand, yeah, ah)
If we run away, yeah, ooh
Baby, you lift me out the struggles that I fell into
But all the crazy things that you put me through
I still wait, keep pushin'
Girl, you pushin'

[Chorus]
I'll take you, oh, forgive me too
And all my love is for you
I sing, "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye"
I'll take you, oh, forgive me too
And all my love is for you
I sing, "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye"
