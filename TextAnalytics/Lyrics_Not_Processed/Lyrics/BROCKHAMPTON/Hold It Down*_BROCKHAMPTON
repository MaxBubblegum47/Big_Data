Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood]
Critique signs, critique harsh
Have a barber at my funeral, make sure my niggas cut right
Lineups like they fresh for a flight, my whole life been glamorized
And dramatized, my sexuality, but baby make it sanitized
Just make the motherfuckers feel it, 'cause it's hammer-sized
Deep in the Atlanta night, we all felt them [?] skies
Move my niggas to Montana, only keep a landline
Holler if you feel me, this feel like the night that 'Pac died
Finna hire more niggas that look like us
And when the ones around your city turn against you, who do I trust?
I seen them lined up and loaded, some of the boys even look like us
Man, I love my couple, double up
And I fuck my thugs, that's love (Merlyn)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control my life, life, life, life
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control ya life, life, life, life

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Merlyn
Fishing in Nazareth, tryna catch a bad bitch
Burnin' big bushes but they never burn to ashes
Catch 'em with the bass line, bring 'em to my palace
Like how my mind sharper than a Samurai tick
One hit of this make the sky really different
Ran for forty nights but I sting like Cassius
Inside her thighs, that's aurora borealis
That's my favorite memory, missionary secondary
Sorry, baby, baby, know you lookin' for a hubby
But the blue faces only thing I wasn't trustin'
Yes, Lord, give it to me, yes, Lord, give it to me
God made melody so I could make money, money

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control my life, life, life, life
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control ya life, life, life, life
