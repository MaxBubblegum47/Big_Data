[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Still trynna make it to tomorrow
My purposes redefining, but my heart still feeling hollow
I stare out the window of my Apollo
It feels like an Impala when I'm whipping thru' the cosmos, alone
Waiting for the reception from the other side
I built this shit to get away from what I couldn't hide
But didn't think that it could turn into my coffin, so far away from home
That love is foreign to my conscience
They said "do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me "do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame?

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why (why?)

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Phone ringing, never outgoing, homebody
Never outgoing, put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish adding notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wide out, wide out
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off kilter, off kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gon' make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a dead head zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't giving up, you should set it off
Tell me "time's up", let the water run, let my body run
