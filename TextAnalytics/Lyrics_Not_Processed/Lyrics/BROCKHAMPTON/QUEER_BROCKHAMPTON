[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Skinny boy, skinny boy, where your muscles at?
Used to walk to work, eight hours, take the bus back
Ain't no time to stop, ain't no time for vacation
Y'all all want my spot 'cause you know that I am A1
All these pretty girls, they come running to our faces
I could do without, I could move without, I could do myself
I get in a rut, I feel depressed, I bang on my chest
I say fuck 'em all 'til I'm dead

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
First off, fuck Dolce & Gabbana (Fuck em, fuck 'em)
Racist mothersuckers tryna be my pana (Pana, pana)
Put that on me auntie and me mama (Mommy, mommy)
Grab the Ghost then I go right back to Ghana (Skrrt)
I came back again (Ayy, ayy), with the platinum (Ayy, ayy)
To the continent (Ayy, ayy), I came back again (Ayy, ayy)
I came back again (Ayy, ayy), with the platinum (Ayy, ayy)
To the continent (Ayy, ayy), I came back again (Ayy, ayy)

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion & 
Kevin Abstract
]
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth 
(Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth 
(W-w-watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth 
(Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth 
(
W-w-watch your lip, baby
)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Got a lot of things to say that I could never finish
Told my mama, "I'll be back, just gotta kill another mission"
Gimme thirty seconds and I'll make off with a billion
Every verse a heist for all your underlying feelings
Got canaries on the window, smell like roses on the ceiling
Oh what a–, oh what a–, oh, how appealing
Candy paint revealing all that bullshit you concealing
Fuck what you been hearing, 
I'm everything they fearing
I'm black and smart and sexy, universally appealing
Genius what I'm dealing, something they ain't stealing
They prohibited the potents, might give you cirrhosis
Spaceship doing donuts,
 
it's written, I'm the POTUS
I'm focused

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion & 
Kevin Abstract
]
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth 
(Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth 
(W-w-watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth 
(Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth 
(W-w-watch your lip, baby)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
Barre Baby, spilled syrup on my big wheel
You could call me lil nigga with the big crib
My lifestyle still the same, just a face lift
Silly niggas got me running out of patience
My whole life slowly turned into a daydream
I hit the bank with a smile on my face, man
Pretty women always pullin' at my waistband
Used to get arrested, all I get is checks now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
