Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Listen, you look so different to me
It's like you barely even know me
You was missin' for me
Swear I'm tired of feelin' lonely
Like, feel mob song, trill mob boy
She been in my ayy far too long, so far
Now catch the conversation, change the conversation
Dollars all I'm chasin', ain't talkin' money, fuck is you sayin'?
Non-comprehensive, money finish sentences
No, I ain't sensitive, nigga, just highly offended

[Chorus: Matt Champion & A$AP Rocky]
Bankroll, lump up in my jeans and that bankroll
Bankroll, limpin' when I walk 'cause of that
Bankroll, never show all them that green, I keep a
Bankroll, I keep a, I keep a, I keep a
Now I'm on my shit you try to get to me (Bankroll)
Every time I tell you differently (Bankroll)
You and him just split, you tryna get with me (Bankroll)
Money be my interest, gotta get the green (Bankroll)

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
The topic today, get a wallet
My lady be spendin', investin'
Whatever you goin', I wallop
Now I get out departments, wylin'
Why I be lookin' like the rich and in college?
Whatever you do, do not stop it
If you wanna salad all up in your pocket
I must be addicted to only the prices
Walk up, buy the diamond, the riches
Whenever they hear this, I wonder what this is
Stop in the field like the different to bridges
I feel like, let's say we run that shit back, and I better keep hittin'
One of them rings on the finger like Rodman and Jordan and Pippen
I had epiphany, I wanna three-peat
I split the wave and they glisten like [?]
Back of the truck with the stack like I'm Scooby-Doo
Waggin' that tail like I'm talkin' dog, who are you?
Bitch in the back and they starin' like, "Who are you?"
Bangin that Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, that "Hootie Hoo"

[Break: Joba]
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
Would you mind?

[Chorus: Matt Champion & A$AP Rocky]
Bankroll, lump up in my jeans and that bankroll
Bankroll, limpin' when I walk 'cause of that
Bankroll, never show all them that green, I keep a
Bankroll, I keep a, I keep a, I keep a
Now I'm on my shit you try to get to me (Bankroll)
Every time I tell you differently (Bankroll)
You and him just split, you tryna get with me (Bankroll)
Money be my interest, gotta get the green (Bankroll)

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
