Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: KRS-One]
Of course all the hardcore heads
This one goes out to you
Crank up the volume one time
Peace to all the real DJs out there
Cause I don't send my music to no garbage DJs
They get me

[Intro: DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything

[Verse: Matt Champion]
Fuck this humble shit, I'm 'bout to run it like a track star
No introduction bitch, I'm 'bout to go that hard
Champion, got the goggles after finals
Sprayin' champagne, askin', "Where the fuck the cork goes?"
Mouths like flamethrowers, down South, all blow
Comin' for the throat like that lil' bitch was down on all fours
Moncler on toes, from the dust I rose
Walkin' on the air, guess the gravity's what I oppose
Hatin' ass dog, gettin' back up on your tip toes
I done seen a lot of y'all worked at Kinko's
I been goin' every night, tryna strike gold
We been itching' for that feelin' like a blown nose
In the kitchen, whippin', flippin' 'til the stove blows
Still a student, I am fluent far as prose goes
Five years ago, nothing, not shit
Five years later, five hundred K, just to spit
And I still can't believe that I ain't done talkin' my shit
I know your ass ain't heard of me
I ain't stopping' 'til I die, just occurred to me
Mo' money, mo' problems, fuck the other ninety nine
Just turned twenty-five and I ain't even in my prime

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything
Yeah

[Outro: Henock Sileshi]
Regardless if you fucking know their name or not
BROCKHAMPTON is a household name, my nigga
Like it or not, it don't matter if you like it
I know that, [?]
Every little sugar
Oh, honeysuckle it
Woo, a crazy expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't be
If a thousand roses
Just wanna [?]
[?]
These are in the making
