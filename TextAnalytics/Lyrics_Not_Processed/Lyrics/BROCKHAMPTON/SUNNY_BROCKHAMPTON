[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
All I do is work and pray (Ay-yah-woo-woo!)
Tryna' find a place to stay (Ay-yah-woo-woo!)
Tryna' find some food today (Ay-yah-woo-woo!)
This shit is real hard okay? (Okay)
Take that, homie got the Lysol spray, ainâ€™t it? (Ain't it?)
You don't wanna see all my bad days, ain't it? (Ain't it?)
You don't wanna see what I got to say, ain't it?
You don't wanna see my boys, man, they ain't friendly

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So it's Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So much Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann & 
Kevin Abstract
]
I just saw my P.O. (What up, nigga?)
He like me, though (He like me, though)
Clean money, tryna stay up out the streets, though
7 days a week though, (
All day!
) it's that heat, though
My daddy called me, said he seen my last video
Looking at a younger me, coulda had a heatstroke
In the middle of the summer with my negros
Cool cuts and snow cones, smoking to the ozone
Smokin' 'til it's all gone, smoking 'til my folks come home

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down

[Outro: bearface & Joba]
Runnin' outta time again
Runnin' outta time again
Runnin' outta time again, mmm
Ay-yeahh, ay-yeahh
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh, ooh
