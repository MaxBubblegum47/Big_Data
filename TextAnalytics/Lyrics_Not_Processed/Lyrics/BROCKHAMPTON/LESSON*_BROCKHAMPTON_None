[Hook: Merlyn Wood]
Never learn my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave
Never learned my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
One more clip for the chamber
I'm gon' live for the labor
I'ma need six hundred lanes
For all of my innovators
Save 'em up for later, pull the gauge up
Cause I'm swinging through the fences
The fire, no consensus
I took a break from college and then became Kanye
They say they throwing three stacks, it make me feel like Andre
I'm losing my archway, coming through the parkway

[Hook: Merlyn Wood]
Never learn my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave
Never learned my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave

[Outro: Joba]
Baby boy, don't cry (baby boy, don't cry)
Where's your sense of pride? (where's your pride?)
I laid it on the line
Won't let you fall behind (fall behind)
