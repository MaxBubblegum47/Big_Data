Lyrics from Snippet

[Ryan Beatty]
Feels like there's somethin' between us
Looks like there's somethin' I dreamed of
When I explain what I'm feelin'
Nobody, nobody understands
Nobody, nobody understands
Nobody, nobody understands
Nobody, nobody understands

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
If you want me by your side, by your side, then I'm ridin' with you
Baby, I'm ridin', yeah-yeah, baby
If you let me spend that night then I'm down to sit in silence with you
Down to sit in silence, down to sit in silence
If you want me by your side, by your side, then I'm ridin' with you
Baby, I'm ridin', yeah-yeah, baby
If you let me spend that night then I'm down to sit in silence with you
Down to sit in silence, down to sit in silence

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Yeah, it's you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it's you (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
Yeah, it's you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it's you (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
You-you, you-you
Yeah...
