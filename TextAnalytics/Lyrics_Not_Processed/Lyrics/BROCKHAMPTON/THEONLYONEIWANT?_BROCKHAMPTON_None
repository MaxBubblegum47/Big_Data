[Intro: BROCKHAMPTON]
Spending all my nights alone, waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waiting for
Tell me what I'm waiting for

[Bridge: DigyBhroniK & BROCKHAMPTON]
Tell me what I'm waiting for
(Do you love me, love me, love me)
Tell me what I'm waiting for
(Do you love me, love me, love me)

[Verse: DigyBhroniK]
All these nights without a call or a text
Tell me what I´m waiting for
Shawty tell me what I´m waiting for
Do I needa wait some more?
Do I needa wait some more?
Do I needa (uh)
Do I needa (uh)
All these nights without a call or a text
You dropped your ex to be with me
Now you got me thinking that I´m next
Tell me what I´m waiting for
Tell me what I´m waiting for
Do I needa wait some more?
Do I needa wait some more?

[Verse: BROCKHAMPTON]
Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
You slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
That lens zooming in, catching all my stripes
Used to trade a joint for some Molly
And she gave me all I need for the night
40s suffice, morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm acting foolish
Could you pick me up around noon-ish?
Half a blunt, yeah we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Time to take a seat and yeah we cruisin'

[Verse: BROCKHAMPTON]
And I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself, but I make it right
Baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you
I'ma make you see that
I want you
I want you

[Chorus: DigyBhroniK & BROCKHAMPTON]
Spending all my nights alone, waiting for you to call me
(Tell me what I´m waiting for)
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
(Tell me what I´m waiting for)

[Outro: DigyBhroniK & BROCKHAMPTON]
So, do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me?
