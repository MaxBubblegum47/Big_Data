[Intro: Jazze Pha]
"Ladies and gentlemen, lions, tigers and bears, giraffes, sea urchins, alligators and all that shit. I am Jazze Phenzel Burgandy Obama Luther King Jr. Jackson 5 the First, and I'd like to introduce to you Block Hemzell, AKA BLOCKHAMPTON! Oh, boy—ladies and gentlemen!"

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Thirty-two hundred on the jacket like Magic Johnson
Got a couple chains off Slauson
Silhouette lookin' like Charlie's Angels
I loose up with a drip of sangria
Wipe that smirk, life ain't that serious
Love when you're double bunned up, like Leia
Make me wanna check my blood pressure
Am I being too obvious?
I got a crush, it's nothing else, I swear, it's nothing else
Wake up, feelin' like Adriana Lima
Wavin' my feet, yo, right up out the Bimmer
Do my dance like ooh, la, la, when she strut like "oh my god"
Make me sweat like exercise, double up, milkshake and fries

[Verse 2: Joba]
I heard a call from the mountain top: "Joba!"
So I put my cloak on and I walked
Coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
Cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
We left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
Just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
Well, now we're eating grapes, and the finest cheese
Achieving wisdom from the wizards we were trying to be
Now other people from our village want to come with me
The thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
You did not believe, they did not believe
You can't tell me things, this was all foreseen
You're not one with me
I bought a horse with the shillings that you took
And then gave back to me
I met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
I bought a castle in the Shire with the moat and the catapult
I keep it clean with my medieval flow

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon & Joba]
Martin had a dream for a nigga like me to show up like this
Why you gotta hate? Looking at my pace
With your face screwed; hope it get stuck like this
Never even cared to appear or adhere my career
Trust me, you don't gotta touch my shit
Pulling every card out the cuff, no bluff is enough to discuss
I won't be the one to rush that shift
Couldn't crush my gift even if I'm in a thousand pieces
Listening to menaces that pledge allegiance
To my every weakness, why they spreading secrets?
Called my dreams facetious, bet they can't believe this
Or they act like the world shoulda knew about me
All I know is they wanted to move without me
How they used to doubt me, but you can’t renounce me
Like la, la, la, la

[Bridge: bearface]
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie, whoop!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Joba]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la, la, la, la

[Outro: Matt Champion]
Thirty-two hundred on the
Thirty-two hundred on the
