Lyrics from Snippets

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
You don't have to say no more, you don't have to say no more
You gon' have to close that door, fuckin' on the hotel floor
I think I need a wake-up call, yeah, that might save us all
Why do we risk it all for some bullshit?

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
That's what I'm tellin' myself (Yeah)
Still gettin' high by myself (Yeah)
Fuckin' these niggas in Dallas (Still)
Still think I'm bi, 'cause she will (Will)
Switchin' lanes, insurance (Uh)
Brought down my endurance (Yeah)
Bounty worth that journey (Yeah)
See what I heard, changin' my ways
I felt like that new, huh (No, no more)

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
You don't have to say no more, you don't have to say no more
You gon' have to close that door, fuckin' on the hotel floor
I think I need a wake-up call, yeah, that might save us all
Why do we risk it all for some bullshit?

[Verse: Matt Champion]
That's what I'm tellin' myself
I'm getting high by myself (I'm getting high), yeah
Arch it up like St. Louis (Arch it like St. Louis)
I see the curts, made me clueless, uh
Pretty back skirt on the curtain (On that curtain)
She layin' back, watch it [?] (Watch it [?])
Usin' her legs without talkin' (Without talkin')
Y'all like that feeling of marble
A little too cold on the knees, uh (Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Shooting in time to one team (Ooh, ooh)
I see the tip through the jeans, huh
Now it gets cold when you speak, huh
Sped up and got in-between, yeah
Love layin' back when I life
I'm in the back for the bitch
She finna ride with a bitch
Speaking, I'll rock with that bitch (Bitch)

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
You don't have to say no more, you ain't gotta say no more, yeah
You gon' have to close that door, fuckin' on the hotel floor
I think we need a wake-up call, yeah, it might save us all
Why do we risk it all for some bullshit?

[Bridge]


First things, fuckin' with the lights on (With the lights on)
Yeah, I'll be fine in the morn'

[Verse: Merlyn Wood]
Ho-ho-ho, bitch, I'm santa
I just know your girl, I'm at her address
No, these hoe-hoe-hoes, oh no-no-no
She a ho-ho-ho, but her name Merlyn
Heard your dare friend, pulled up in her basement
I went, "No-no-no," ain't no Merlyn
Then she let me in, her backdoor-door-door-door
I'm supposed to see your girl and her anus
She pulled the gift out my pants while I get breakfast
I took her cookies back in Indiana
I been gettin' to the cash bro, you cannot tell
I been eatin' good, why they call it brisket
Oh, that's your girl? Don't ever play yourself
Now my genitals in her, it's in pair with Merlyn
I been gettin' to the cash, like cereal
I'm serious
