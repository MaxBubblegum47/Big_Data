[Verse 1]
Hey, little darling
I'm gonna take you out of the darkness
I wanna walk with you in the light, yeah
Hold your head high
Hey, little darling
We better go before it is too late
Sneak out the window, undone the fires here
Hold my hand tight

[Chorus]
Cause we're just run-run-runaways
Run, run, renegades
Run, run to get away
And we just run, run because we ain't
Giving it up, gotta get away
Always a haunted place
Oh, you and I are the ghosts
How I wanna take you home
But we're just run-run-runaways
Run, run, renegades
Nowhere we couldn't stay

[Verse 2]
Hey, little darling
When
 we're not welcome here in this party
They're looking through us, 
I'm going high
, yeah
Hold your head high

[Chorus]
Cause we're just run-run-runaways
Run, run, renegades
Run, run to get away
And we just run, run because we ain't
Giving it up, gotta get away
Always a haunted place
Oh, you and I are the ghosts
How I wanna take you home
But we're just run-run-runaways
Run, run, renegades
Nowhere we couldn't stay

[Outro]
Oh, you and I are the ghosts
How I wanna take you home
But we're just run-run-runaways
Run, run, renegades
Nowhere we couldn't stay
