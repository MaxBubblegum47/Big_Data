[Verse 1]
She drips diamonds like a glacier melts
She's self-made, down to her buckles and belts
And she's really happy, but not with a lot
And she gets her pleasures from her chemist shop

[Pre-Chorus]
She's busy, busy losing the plot
Busy, but her mind is shut
Doesn't really want it to stop
She just says now

[Chorus]
Hey there, sister
That bottle leads to hell
I ain't drinking that
Honey, can't you tell
Jump while they're swimming, this ship is sinking
Got no soul to sell, so
Hey there, mister
Throw some luck away to the wishing well
Throw some luck away to the wishing well

[Verse 2]
Don't start thinking, it messes with your head
Go with instincts, the sweet or the dead
True love is out there, it's waiting with a ring
You'll know her face the second she walks in

[Pre-Chorus]
He's busy, busy losing the plot
Busy, but his mind is shut
He doesn't really want it to stop
He just says now

[Chorus]
Hey there, sister
That bottle leads to hell
I ain't drinking that
Honey, can't you tell
Jump while they're swimming, this ship is sinking
Got no soul to sell, so
Hey there, mister
Throw some luck away to the wishing well
Throw some luck away to the wishing well

Hey there, sister
That bottle leads to hell
I ain't drinking that
Honey, can't you tell
Jump while they're swimming, this ship is sinking
Got no soul to sell, so
Hey there, mister
Throw some luck away to the wishing well
Throw some luck away to the wishing well
