[Verse 1: Heidi Rojas]
Sorry, I'm not sorry
I don't regret a single mistake
You're worth every heartache
Wouldn't try to avoid the grenades
It's a beautiful explosion
Can't walk away

[Chorus: Heidi Rojas]
Now we're standing in the shadows of love
I guess everything just wasn't enough
We'll say we could've tried harder
We'll pray 'til we're out of the dark
Now we're standing in the shadows of love
Now we're standing in the shadows of love
I guess everything just wasn't enough
We'll say we could've tried harder
We'll pray 'til we're out of the dark
Now we're standing in the shadows of love
Torn apart
Torn apart
Now we're standing in the shadows of love

[Break]

[Verse 2: Heidi Rojas]
Sorry, I'm not sorry
I don't regret a single mistake
You're worth every heartache
Wouldn't try to avoid the grenades
It's a beautiful explosion
Can't walk away

[Chorus: Heidi Rojas]
Now we're standing in the shadows of love
I guess everything just wasn't enough
We'll say we could've tried harder
We'll pray 'til we're out of the dark
Now we're standing in the shadows of love
Now we're standing in the shadows of love
I guess everything just wasn't enough
We'll say we could've tried harder
We'll pray 'til we're out of the dark
Now we're standing in the shadows of love
Torn apart
Torn apart
Now we're standing in the shadows of love

[Break]

[Outro: Heidi Rojas]
Now we're standing in the shadows of love
I guess everything just wasn't enough
We'll say we could've tried harder
We'll pray 'til we're out of the dark
Now standing in the shadows of love
