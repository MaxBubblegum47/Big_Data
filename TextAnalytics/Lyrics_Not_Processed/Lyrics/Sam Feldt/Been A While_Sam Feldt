[Verse 1]
It's been a while
Since I let you
Cross my mind
I can let you run

[Chorus]
How could I let you go?
Haven't seen you 'round here for a while
How could I let you go?
Haven't seen you naked for a while

[Break]

[Verse 2]
It's been a while
Since I let you
Drive around
I could choose you, lover

[Chorus]
How could I let you go?
Haven't seen you 'round here for a while
How could I let you go?
Haven't seen you naked for a while

[Break]

[Outro]
Haven't seen you 'round here for a while
Haven't seen you naked for a while
