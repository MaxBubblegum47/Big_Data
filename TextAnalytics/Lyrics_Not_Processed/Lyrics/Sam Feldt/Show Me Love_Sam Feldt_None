Heartbreaks and promises
I've had more than my share
I'm tired of giving my love
And getting nowhere, nowhere

It's been so long since
I've touched your wanting hand
I'll put my love on the line
Yes I hope you'll understand

So, baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, but
You've got to show me love
But, you've got to show me love

I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one night affairs
What I need is somebody who will always be there

Don't you promise me the world
World that I already
This time, call me baby
Actions speak louder than words

If you're looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Come, my love is guaranteed

So, baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, but
You've got to show me love
You give me reason
You've got to show me love
