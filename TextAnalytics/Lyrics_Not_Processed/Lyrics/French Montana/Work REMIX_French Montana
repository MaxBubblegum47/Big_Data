[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
I gotta close the window before I record
‘Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
(Work) 
Stand up!
(Work) Ferg!
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Coogi down to the socks like I'm Biggie Poppa (baby)
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho
‘Cause you know the Fergenstein gettin' plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shinin' in the Benzo
Ballin', got me feelin' like Jim Jones,
 
I'm a pimp though
No limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer, then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the building, semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they gettin' on my nerves
I ain't lyin', lay 'em on the curb
Ridin' on a killer who be comin' at Ferg (damn!)
Girl, you twerk, twerk that kitty, girl, make it purr
Put in work, Flacko put 'em in the dirt
French got the shovel, he gon' put him in the earth
Trinidad maniac with an all-gold hearse
Yeah, uh, put in work
ScHoolboy Q with a pound of the purp
So much work he'll smoke up the Earth
Polo Ground, A$AP World

[Verse 2: French Montana]
(Haaan!) That ain't Kanye
That's Montana, loose cannon
He shot me, so I had to do it
Put him in the dirt, put him in it first
I just sold a swammy with ten homis on it
Her ass fat, you could park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, comin' for your ice
When they bare-faced, they comin' for your life
Baby, don't pray for me, pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean, it help me sleep
Illuminati? I'm from the streets
Never sold my body, we takin' bodies

[Chorus]
Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
Shout out that motherland
12-years-old with guns in hand
They don't ask no questions, nigga
All they do is bang bang bang
They don't ask no questions, all they do is bang bang
I said I do this for them shottas, Trinidad, I love ya
I do this for them shottas, Jamaica, I'm your brother
I know a bitch from VI
Yeah-yeah-yeah, that's my partner
You got a problem with it
Then-then-then-then that's your problem
I fuck with Asian niggas and I fuck with Migos
I fuck with Haitian niggas, all they speak is Creole
I said all I speak is real, y'all niggas might hate me
But that don't get no deal
I said no, that don't get no deal
I just now got my deal, but I been gettin' this money
No green card in this struggle
Immigration give you nothin' but work (put it in work)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
YAWK-YAWK, YAWK-YAWK!
A lot of niggas died, should've been from Hoover Street
No, I do not have a car, but I could buy one every week
Pimpin' like I'm 33,
 
move keys like I'm 36
Ship O's like I'm 28
Tacoma know I'm pushin' weight
O-X-Y,
 I'm in your state
Eatin' off your dinner plate
My heart live where Santa stay
Super fly, I need a cape
Bitches throwin' pussy back and forth, they on my dick
Passion drippin' off her lip
She say she never had a Crip
Uh, put in work, all big booties make it twerk
All big titties lift your shirt
Show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put in work, spray his ass in front of the church
Deacon said I did my shit
The pastor said, "That nigga turnt"
Pop my collar on my shirt
Make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units; Captain Kirk
Takin' xannies, poppin' percs
Might not last, I'll bomb you first
Turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth
Had to give Young Ferg a verse

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
A lot of homies cried, due to crimes, homicide
Drivin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Outta line, pistols barkin' (argh argh), ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that pretty Flacko?
 
Ratchets,
 
designer jackets
The same niggas who jack it
Be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress
Side bitch won a beauty pageant
Got a chick that worked at Magic
But I'm so damn fine make a bitch look average
See, my daddy in Heaven, right next to Ferg's
You know what's up I'm throwin' bucks
Loaded Lux; put in work
