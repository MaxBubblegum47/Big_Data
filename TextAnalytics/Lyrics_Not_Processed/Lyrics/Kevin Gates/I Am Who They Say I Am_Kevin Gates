[Intro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm all who you say I a-a-am
(Shawty say I she feeling me, I ain't never set back tho')
Yessir

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Thug nigga from the trenches never had a heart
Drug dealer, contract killer, loyal from the start (Start)
I put that dope dick down on shawty, I've been servin' raw
They say I'm pussy and they say I'm fake but I say

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm all who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Got into it with my bitch, caught up while I'm tourin'
Tryna see if shawty on my dick, wonder what she doin'
You know me, real G, I text ask her, "How it's goin'"
She responded nothin', lookin' like to me you havin' fun
Look for my mama when I try to look inside my woman
Told my bae, "I wish I woulda found you back when I was bummin'"
Stayed away from all the bullshit, them niggas said I'm runnin'
Time passed over now you see that I was chasin' money
Posted on Maryland, me and Von, his mama tearin' just once
Know you seen up in the parish, like check it out that's my lil' youngin'
Nigga don't wanna sell me a brick of dope, act like my money funny
Damn what you sayin' gangsta, you gon' make me take it from you
Some hoes say I'm handsome, some of them they say I'm ugly
Some say that I'm the realest but I still ain't sayin' nothin'
'Cause

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I'm all who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh
I upgraded from nobody to the one who the man, yeah (To the man, yeah)
I'm all who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 3: Quando Rondo]
Tryna run me up a check, late nights, early mornings
Diamonds 'round my neck, they really wet, I could've copped a foreign
Givenchy shoes, I came a long way from Ralph Lauren
Cut off my ex because my new bitch put that pussy on me
They watchin' every move I make, I guess I'm settin' trends
I had to focus on the check, told myself, "Fuck a friend"
Committed crimes so many times but I don't give a damn
I are who you say I am
Posted on high street, me and roof 'cause we been really thuggin'
Convicted felon with a dirty pistol, bitch I'm steady clutchin'
No drama sittin' in my cell like check out my lil' cousin
Can't trust these hoes because I know they come a dime a dozen
RIP to Quahfee, know my nigga at them Heaven gates
She ain't never really made love, I'm him just like Kevin Gates

[Verse 4: Kevin Gates]
20 of 'em comin', I switched to another spot
Reversible stock carbon, a new convertible drop
I was gambling with shawty, I put some work on the block
I tested her, she held a lil' quarter bird at her spot
I ain't into bustin' down a Rollie, bustin' down on bales
Don't wanna fuck me, I won't argue baby, oh well
The 18 Willard, the lever get 'em movin' mils
Millionaire dollar bond in 30 minutes and I made bail
I graduated, the square's outta town, at the room cookin' at the hotel (yeah, yeah)
Aux is outta reach, I'ma move the race car (Vroom)
Hated on us and they know who they are
Still livin' large as I aim for the stars
I'm a BreadWinner don and I came from the slums
I got a stain on my arm, weather through the storm
If I tell you that I love you then you can't do nothin' wrong
Surrounded by steppers, I got control in this bitch
I'll book you for a show and get you showed in this bitch
Tell that curb boy Trell I love you with all my heart
Now we ride around in Wraiths with a push button start (vroom)

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Cause I'm all who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh
I upgraded from nobody to the one who the man, yeah (to the man, yeah)
I'm all who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
