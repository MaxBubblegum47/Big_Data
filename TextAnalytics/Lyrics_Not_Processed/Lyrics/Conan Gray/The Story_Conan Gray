[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a story about a boy and a girl
It's kinda short, kinda boring, but the end is a whirl
They were just sixteen when the people were mean
So they didn't love themselves, and now they're gone
Headstones on a lawn

[Verse 2]
And when I was younger, I knew a boy and a boy
Best friends with each other, but always wished they were more
'Cause they loved one another, but never discovered
'Cause they were too afraid of what they'd say
Moved to different states

[Chorus]
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story

[Verse 3]
Now it's on to the sequel about me and my friend
Both our parents were evil, so we both made a bet
If we worked and we saved, we could both run away
And we'd have a better life, and I was right
I wonder if she's alright

[Chorus]
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story
Okay

[Bridge]
And the movie's always runnin' in my head
All the people, all the lovers, all my friends
And I hope that they all get their happy end
In the end

[Chorus]
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It’s not the end of the story, hmm, hmm
