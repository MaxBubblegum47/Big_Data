[Intro]
Why why why why
Why why why why
Why why why

[Verse 1]
I was off keying cars parked on radium lawns
By suburbian moms
I called a friend, "Let's meet at ten"
Go wherever we want
'Cause no one cares that we're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
This town don't got much to do
And you and I haven't got much to lose
So do you wanna rot in your room like we always do?
Talk about how fast we grew
And all the big dreams that we won't pursue
Then get in your car and laugh 'til we both turn blue

[Chorus]
'Cause we are the helpless, selfish, one of a kind
Millennium kids, that all wanna die
Walking in the street with no light inside our eyes
We are the worthless, cursed with too much time
We get into trouble and lose our minds
Something that I've heard a million times in my life
Generation Why

[Verse 2]
Parents think we're fast asleep
But as soon as we're home we're sneaking out the window
'Cause at this rate of earth decay
Our world's ending at noon
Could we all just move to the moon?

[Pre-Chorus]
This town don't got much to do
And you and I haven't got much to lose
So do you wanna leave everyone in this place for good?

[Chorus]
'Cause we are the helpless, selfish, one of a kind
Millennium kids, that all wanna die
Walking in the street with no light inside our eyes
We are the worthless, cursed with too much time
We get into trouble and lose our minds
Something that I've heard a million times in my life
Generation Why

[Bridge]
Why why why why why why why why why
We're livin' night to night
Why why why why why why why why why
Since we're bound to die, oh
Why why why why why why why why why
Oh, what's the use in trying?
Why why why why why why why why why
And it's exactly why

[Chorus]
We are the helpless, selfish, one of a kind
Millennium kids, that all wanna die
Walking in the street with no light inside our eyes
We are the worthless, cursed with too much time
We get into trouble and lose our minds
Something that I've heard a million times in my life
Generation why

[Outro]
Why why why why why why why why
Why why why why why why why why
Why why why why why why why why
Why why why why why why why why
