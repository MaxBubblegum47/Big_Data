[Verse 1]
Let's go back to the summer night
When we met eyes, it’s like a movie line
Kissin' underneath the city lights
But now you're laying in another guy’s arms
'Cause I'm all gone

[Chorus]
But when you look in his eyes
Do you think of mine?
And when you look at that smile
Do I cross your mind?
I know in your head
You see me instead
'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then
Baby don't lie
He's just a lookalike

[Verse 2]
Can't redo what's already done
Can’t compete ’cause I've already won
Sayin’ this time, "It's really love"
But honey, you're not fooling anyone
Don't you know we’re done?

[Chorus]
But when you look in his eyes
Do you think of mine?
And when you look at that smile
Do I cross your mind?
I know in your head
You see me instead
'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then
Baby don't lie
He's just a lookalike

[Bridge]
And I'll admit that I sometimes, maybe, might
Think about you at night, well, almost every night
No matter how I try to hide
And erase you from my mind
I'm dying
To find a lookalike

[Chorus]
'Cause when you look in his eyes
Hope you think of mine
And when you look at that smile
Hope I cross your mind
I hope in your head
You see me instead
'Cause you've been in mine every day since then
Maybe it's time to find a lookalike

[Outro]
No, I can't lie
I need a lookalike
