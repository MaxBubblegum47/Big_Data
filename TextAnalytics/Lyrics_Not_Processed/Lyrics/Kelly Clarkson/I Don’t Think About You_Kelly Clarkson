[Verse 1]
When you're lost in the moment
You can't see where you're goin'
I didnâ€™t know who I could trust
So I put all my faith in us
Oh, you tore me to pieces
Turned my strength into weakness
I didn't want it all to fall apart
So I decided just to play the part

[Pre-Chorus]
But honestly, I'd do it all again
Puttin' up with all the bullshit
It made me strong enough to do this

[Chorus]
It used to bother me, thought I could never leave
After all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove
No, no, no, I don't think about you
Weighing down on me
I lost my sanity
And now that we are through, nothin' left to lose
No, no, no, I don't think about you

[Verse 2]
I feel freedom where I stand now
And I feel proud of who I am now
Yeah, I learned a lot along the way
I love the woman that I became

[Pre-Chorus]
I was patient, but not anymore
It's back in my hands
And you swore I'd never do it
But it's your time to face the music

[Chorus]
It used to bother me, thought I could never leave
After all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove
No, no, no, I don't think about you
Weighing down on me
I lost my own sanity
And now that we are through, nothin' left to lose
No, no, no, I don't think about you

[Bridge]
It was hard to hold on
Days and nights I thought I'd never make it at all
Couldn't make it at all
Now I stand tall
Feeling like myself again, no worries at all
Breathe
No one can stop me from livin' this moment for me
I found my heartbeat
After all that I've been through
No, I don't think about you

[Chorus]
It used to bother me, thought I could never leave
After all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove
No, no, no, I don't think about you
Weighing down on me
I found my sanity
And now that we are through, nothin' left to lose
No, no, no, I don't think about you

[Outro]
I don't think about you (no)
(No, no, no) No, no, no
(Not anymore) Not anymore
No, no, no, I don't think about you
