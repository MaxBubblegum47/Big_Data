[Intro: Travis Scott & Yung Lean]
I could jump off a bridge and let you walk over me
I tend to stay inside myself, I don't want you to take over me
I've been jet skiin', jet skiin' in Dubai
I've been jet skiin', jet skiin' in Dubai

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Dubai shit, Dubai whips
Different place, different chips (Yeah)
ATL, this shit ludicrous (Yeah, yeah)
Oh well, they like who that is (Straight up)
Yeah, Dubai shit, Dubai whips (It's lit)
Different place, different chips (Yeah)
ATL, this shit ludicrous (Alright)
Know me well, know who that is (Yah)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
I don't know, where to go (Yah)

Give those here, you can't handle those (It's lit)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Trampoline (Trampo'), Michael Jordan dreams (Jordan)

Want straight cash, no checks please (Cash)
Shoot out that coupe (Brrt), what you gon' do? (Who?)

[Verse 3: Quavo & Offset]
Fish bowl (Fishes), Super Bowl (Super Bowl)
I played with Montana and Rice before (White rice)
Huncho not tellin' no lie, oh, it's so hot in Dubai
I see your soul in your eyes (Soul), I let the opium dry (Drank)
Good drank (drank), mixed with antidote (Anna')
I put her on Molly, Cac' put her on snow (Montana)
Never was a fan of the O's (No), came from the land of the Nawf'
Whippin' the pan on the stove (Stove), whip it 'til your hand grow mold (Yeah)
