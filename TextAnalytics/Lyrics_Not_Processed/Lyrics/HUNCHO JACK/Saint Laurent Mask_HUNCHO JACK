[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Ain't givin' out no freebees

Take them bars, no 3G, yeah
Live fast, live life easy
Pour a 'lil drop in my sweet tea
X-rated, no PG

She don't wanna keep 'em (Yeah)
She fuck 'em then leave 'em (Yeah, smash)
She hope I hit her (Brrt, brrt)

She want me to get her a bag, a house or maybe a Bimmer (Skrr-skrr)
I might say some shit out of my mouth, but still won't leave her (Still, still)

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
I might say some shit out of my mouth, call my paralegal, uh
I done did some shit in my life ridin' in that Regal, uh

Can't live backwards, live life, that shit evil
