[Intro: Travis Scott]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Murda on the beat, so it's not nice

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, mama built a saint (Saint, yeah)
Yeah, countin' up the O's, I thank (Thank, alright)
Yeah, lookin' at the O's I drank (Aw, it's lit)
You can't see that on the road, I blank
Yeah, mama built a saint (Saint, yeah)
Yeah, countin' up the O's, I thank (Thank, alright)
Yeah, lookin' at the O's I drank (Aw, it's lit)
You can't see that on the road, I blank

[Verse 1: Quavo]
(Huncho)
What I bought (What you buy?)
I'm just lookin' at this mansion I bought (Straight cash)
It just came with fifteen rooms and a vault (Fifteen)
Ocean in the back, top floor a loft (Woo), ayy
We gonna slide today (We gonna slide, slide, slide)
She drowning, swim in the Ace
Mob ties, no lace, putting young niggas in place (Mob ties)
Remember back then I finessed on my face (Finesse)
JanSport book bag and a throwaway (Gone)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, mama built a saint (Saint, yeah)
Yeah, countin' up the O's, I thank (Thank, alright)
Yeah, lookin' at the O's I drank (Aw, it's lit)
You can't see that on the road, I blank

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Quavo]
Nah, lit ain't lit for me, yeah, yeah
A four in Brisk, that's my cup of tea, yeah
Look behind the blinds, nobody can see, yeah
Collect the platinum hits like they jewelry, yeah
I might charge you fifty thousand for the sauce (Sauce and drip)
Ace Ventura, Marino, I play with dolphins (Dolphins, splash)
Count up the deads, no coffin (Coffins, deads)
Pullin' out that fire, out that arson
A lot of jelly on this PJ, made it say 4K (Yah)
You niggas 'round runnin' down my juice, I ran it back, OJ (It's lit)
Rubber bands make 'em twerk, diamonds make 'em twerk (Pop it, pop it)
Out in LIV every Sunday like you goin' to church
Fuck wrong with these niggas? (Ooh)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, mama built a saint (Saint, yeah!)
Yeah, countin' up the O's, I thank (Thank, alright!)
Yeah, lookin' at the O's I drank (Aw, it's lit!)
You can't see that on the road, I blank
