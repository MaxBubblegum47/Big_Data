[Verse 1]
I know you're thinking 'bout my kiss
You're staring at my lips, just tell me what you want from me
(Tell me what you want from me)
I know it 'cause I feel it, too
But I need to hear the truth, yeah, tell me what you want from me
(Tell me what you want from me)

[Chorus]
Take me to the bridge, lay me on the ground
No more holding back now, time is running out
Come on, baby, truth or dare? Truth or dare?
Now that we're alone, show me who you are
Tell me that you want me, take me in your arms
Come on, baby, truth or dare? Truth or dare?

[Post-Chorus]
Truth or dare?

[Verse 2]
I'm daring you to cross the line
I can't wait another night, just tell me what you want from me
(Tell me what you want from me)
And you're telling me that you're too shy
But I see it in your eyes, so tell me what you want from me
(Tell me what you want from me)

[Chorus]
Take me to the bridge, lay me on the ground
No more holding back now, time is running out
Come on, baby, truth or dare? Truth or dare?
Now that we're alone, show me who you are
Tell me that you want me, take me in your arms
Come on, baby, truth or dare? Truth or dare?

[Post-Chorus]
Truth or dare?

[Bridge]
I'm not a ghost love, just wanna lose control
We could be so free, you and me
I wanna feel the head rush, wanna feel your touch
Baby, take me there, truth or dare?

[Outro]
Truth or dare?
