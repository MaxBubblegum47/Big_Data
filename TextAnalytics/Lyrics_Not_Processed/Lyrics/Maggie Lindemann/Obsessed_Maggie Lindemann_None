[Verse 1]
Baby, you got something special
Your body is a work of art
But we got a little issue
I feel your chest, but I can't find your heart
Got more muscles than the ocean
Sculpted like an ancient god
Full of yourself, but no emotion
Yeah, I like to touch, but I can't feel no love

[Pre-Chorus]
You're looking in my eyes, just to see your own
See your own reflection, your own reflection
Your body's overpriced 'cause you pay yourself
Way too much attention, too much attention

[Chorus]
You're so obsessed with yourself
Maybe you should undress with yourself? Hey
Get a table for two, your ego and you
Take him home and make a move
So obsessed with yourself, obsessed with yourself

[Verse 2]
Baby, like your lady special
Picture perfect beauty bells
Only looking surface level
That's if you can take your eyes of yourself
Gonna end up with nobody, nobody
Even though we form a line, oh yeah
But I don't even think you're worried
If you've got a mirror, baby, you're fine

[Pre-Chorus]
You're looking in my eyes, just to see your own
See your own reflection, your own reflection
Your body's overpriced 'cause you pay yourself
Way too much attention, too much attention

[Chorus]
You're so obsessed with yourself
Maybe you should undress with yourself? Hey
Get a take of the two, your ego and you
Take him home and make a move
So obsessed with yourself, obsessed with yourself
You're so obsessed with yourself
Maybe you should undress with yourself? Hey
Get a table for two, your ego and you
Take him home and make a move
So obsessed with yourself, obsessed with yourself

[Outro]
Do it, baby, like you do
I love it and I hate it too
Do it, baby, like you do
'Cause I'm obsessed with myself too
