[Verse 1: $NOT]
I see my name in the back, now I'm in the fuckin' front (Haha)
Two-door coupe foreign, no roof, with a blunt (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Maggie Lindemann]
Ain't no place in this world I won't go
We just turn the suitcase into a home
And I like when we take it too far
But I'd, I'd rather be closer
Play with me like a video game
Sayin' you like when I'm taking control
If my love can't be your fix, then
What are we up all night for?

[Chorus: $NOT]
Okay, I hop up in my coupe, yeah (Wassup?)
Wassup? Do you wanna go far with me? (With me)
Hold my hand, I ain't really goin' far (Uh-uh)
Bitch, I'll take you to the moon and the stars (And the stars)
'Kay, I hop up in my coupe, yeah (Wassup?)
Wassup? Do you wanna go far with me? (With me)
Hold my hand, I ain't really goin' far (Uh-uh)
Bitch, I'll take you to the moon and the stars (And the stars)
