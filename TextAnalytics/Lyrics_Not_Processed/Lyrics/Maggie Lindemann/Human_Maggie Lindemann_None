[Verse 1]
I’ve got like 30 missed calls
Staying in another night
And I've been talking to the walls
Feel a bit out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You don't even know, you don't even know
What is going on, what is going on
I could try to smile, done it for a while
But nobody knows it like I

[Chorus]
I wish, I wish I was human
I wish that I could say shit like you did
Where it's any other time but it's useless, nah nah
And if you saw through my eyes you'd understand why
I wish I was human
I wish that I could see shit like you did
Where it's sunny all the time but it's useless, nah nah
And if you saw through my eyes you'd understand why

[Verse 2]
I've been trying to drink away
All the nights I can't forget
And the voices screaming in my head
‘Bout the things I most regret

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't even know, you don't even know
Nobody knows it like I

[Chorus]
I wish, I wish I was human
I wish that I could say shit like you did
Where it's any other time but it's useless, nah nah
And if you saw through my eyes you'd understand why
I wish I was human
I wish that I could see shit like you did
Where it's sunny all the time but it's useless, nah nah
And if you saw through my eyes you'd understand why

[Bridge]
Oooh (Nah nah nah nah nah)
Oooh (Wish I, wish I was)
Oooh (Nah nah nah nah)
Oooh

[Chorus]
I wish I was human
I wish that I could say shit like you did
Where it's any other time but it's useless, nah nah
And if you saw through my eyes you'd understand why
