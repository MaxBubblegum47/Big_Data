[Verse 1]
Don't know what I should do
Sometimes I wish we could go somewhere
I feel it all around, I know you're seeing it too

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to know if these words are enough
Sometimes you got to give it up
Sometimes you better not be rough
'Cause I need to know when I'm down and in trouble

[Chorus]
Jump in the water
Jump in the waterfall
Jump in the waterfall

[Verse 2]
I want to work this out
The words you say don't fit right now
I hear your name around
Sometimes it takes too long

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to know if these words are enough
Sometimes you've got to give things up
Sometimes you better not let go
'Cause I need to know when I'm down and in trouble

[Chorus]
Jump in the water
Jump in the waterfall
Jump in the waterfall
Jump in the waterfall
Jump in the waterfall
Jump in the waterfall
Jump in the waterfall

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh huh
Oh oh oh huh
Jump in the water
Jump in the water
Oh oh oh huh
Oh oh oh huh
Jump in the water
Jump in the water

[Outro]
Oh oh oh huh
Oh oh oh huh
Jump in the water
Jump in the waterfall
Oh oh oh huh
Oh oh oh huh
Jump in the water
Jump in the waterfall
