[Intro]
And if you step into his world, with his mind
You will see it quickly change into a beautiful, exciting world of fantasy

[Verse 1]
We face the adventure
Try to survive everyday
Please let us fade out the routine
To make us live forever

[Chorus]
Waking up
Spend the day
Let's get drunk
And once again
Waking up
Spend the day
Let's get drunk
And once again
Waking up (forever)
Spend the day (forever)
Let's get drunk (forever)
And once again
Waking up
And once again

[Outro]
Exciting world of fantasy
Try to fade out the routine
To make us leave forever
