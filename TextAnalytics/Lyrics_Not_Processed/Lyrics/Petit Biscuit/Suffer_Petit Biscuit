[Chorus]
Do you know, do you know, do you know me at all?
You think that you can stand when I fall
Domino, domino, domino all you want
You're better off when we are apart
Do you know, do you know, do you know me at all?
You think that you can stand when I fall
Domino, domino, domino all you want
You're better off when we are apart
Do you know, do you know, do you know me at all?
You think that you can stand when I fall
Domino, domino, domino all you want
You're better off when we are apart

[Verse]
I'm hanging on my own, my own
I'm going out for dinner, having whisky on my own
I'm hanging out alone, alone
Make coffee, get a hobby, feeling awesome on my own
I'm hanging on my own, my own
I'm going out for dinner, having whisky on my own
I'm hanging out alone, alone
Make coffee, get a hobby, feeling awesome on my own

[Chorus]
Do you know, do you know, do you know me at all?
You think that you can stand when I fall
Domino, domino, domino all you want
You're better off when we are apart
Do you know, do you know, do you know me at all?
You think that you can stand when I fall
Domino, domino, domino all you want
You're better off when we are apart
Do you know, do you know, do you know me at all?
You think that you can stand when I fall
Domino, domino, domino all you want
You're better off when we are apart

[Outro]
I'm hanging on my own (My own)
I'm hanging out alone (Alone)
Alone
