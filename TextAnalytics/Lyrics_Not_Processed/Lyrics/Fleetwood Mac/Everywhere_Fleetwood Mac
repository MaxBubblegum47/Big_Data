[Intro: Christine McVie]
Calling out your name
Calling out your name

[Verse 1: Christine McVie]
Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud
And I can't get the words out

[Chorus: Christine McVie]
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly
Come along, baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

[Chorus: Christine McVie]
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3: Christine McVie]
Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
Come along, baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

[Chorus: Christine McVie]
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere
