[Verse 1]
To all my fallen squad
Write your name across the sky
While I flame one to the brain and gon' get high
And regardless of the pain I ain't gon' cry
Cuz I can never let no fuck nigga see me stuck nigga
Hustle hard for them bucks nigga
Thats a must nigga
I done lost so many real niggas
I can't trust niggas
So I keep my distance from niggas
Squad with me bet I won't get touched nigga
Got shots for him, shots for him
Niggas sayin fuck Rocblock, send shots at them
10-0 on the scoreboard, sent shots again
Keep going nonstop til we drop lots of men
And I swear I lost so many of my guys
So im sippin Remy, smokin 50's for my guys
Never let a nigga blow any of my guys
Ain't nobody fuckin with NoLimit in my eyes
Missin my niggas
Kushy and liquor, 4's of the lean
RIP Richie, hand me a swisha
Paint up a picture
Of me and the squad still on the block
Before it went wrong
And Kobe wasn't gone and Joc was still home
Man, I remember
Now my heart is cold as December
Get money the only thing thats on my agenda
Cuz its too many gone, but im still livin on
Stayin strong, put my farewells in this song

[Bridge]
Squad
RIP my niggas man
Welcome to Fazoland the Mixtape
Ball like Im Kobe
RIP Vito, Chico, Fazo, Lil Roc
RIP Pistol P man
For all my niggas gone man
We just gonna write yall name across the sky man
RIP my squad

[Verse 2]
I'll give up the money, fuck the fame, all the jewels
All the hoes, all the clothes and all the shoes
Just bring my niggas back
But I know I'll never get em back
So if a pussy disrespect then he gettin wacked
And I hear niggas at my neck, I'm like "where they at?"
Cuz I be right there on the set with the biggest gat
Got so many niggas thats hatin, ion even know em
And so many fellings of hatred, I dont even show em
Can I just get some money? cuz I know niggas broke and bummy
They ain't even funny
I know they prolly wanna rob me
They hate me prolly
But they only gonna make Mally come catch a body
They won't get nothin from me
From the hellhole wheres its full of zombies
Where they catch the most bodies across the country
Where they took all of my homies from me
Man, RIP my homies, gotta get this money
SQUAD, RIP the L's
Free the L's why you niggas wanna be the L's
No Limit MB, bitch we the L's
RIP White Folks, I can't see a L
Squad, and we gotta stay winnin
Rollin in 4's with them semis and they tinted
Pull up on the oppas, pose' to be there and they hidin'
Cuz they scored when we ain't have them heaters
But they didn't!
HANN!
