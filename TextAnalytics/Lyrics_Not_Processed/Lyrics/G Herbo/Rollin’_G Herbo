When we at the club man, we 150 deep, you already know
We ain't on shit though, man, just keep eyes to yourself, nigga
Watch your step
Bad bitches to the right, weak bitches to the left
Like I said man we here to party
You do what you gone do
If you smoke, you gone smoke
If you drink, you gone drink
If you gone roll, you gone roll
Do your thing just don't step on these all white G Fazos
Gang! Turn up

[Hook]
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm bussin' it's bussin', I'm bussin' it's bussin'
Somebody pass me a water or something
I'm bussin', I'm bussin', I'm bussin', it's bussin'
Somebody pass me a water or something
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
Now everywhere I go, I'm with my niggas
Everywhere I go, I let my chain swang
You a fuck nigga, stay in your lane
This ain't nothin' to us cause we gang bang

[Verse 1]
Herbo steppin' out, everything designer
Off of Louie V, drinkin' Fiji water
Belt Louie V, sag my Truey jeans
Hit the club deep and we off them yoppas
All my niggas fly, we came for the bitches
But don't get it twisted, we still for the drama
Pop a lot of bottles, all my niggas with me
The ones you don't see? Outside with them choppas
Back to what I said, we here for the hoes
All them bitches love me now
I'm gettin' money, I might pull up in a Rov
Came from nothin', I just had to let them know
So don't mix me up in this rap shit
I don't rap beef, get you wrapped quick
I be in the streets, every nigga know me
If you lookin' for me, you can get to me
150 with me, my shooters with me
All they know is kill, show no sympathy
And they kill for free, don't get killed for me
Lil bro got it on him off a pill or three
We don't show ID, couple shorties with me
Tottin' thirty clips only sixteen
Fly my bros out, buy some new poles
Spend a few cheese, that's a sixteen

[Pre-Hook]
And who this nigga approachin'? Don't know him
If he do somethin' put infrared on him
He make a move and you know we start blowin'
They rollin', they rollin', they rollin', they rollin'
Bitch in my section and I know she on me
After I stroke her, leave her pussy soakin'
Suck me up then and we gone fuck til the mornin'
I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin', we rollin'

[Hook]
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm bussin' it's bussin', I'm bussin' it's bussin'
Somebody pass me a water or something
I'm bussin', I'm bussin', I'm bussin', it's bussin'
Somebody pass me a water or something
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
Now everywhere I go, I'm with my niggas
Everywhere I go, I let my chain swang
You a fuck nigga, stay in your lane
This ain't nothin' to us cause we gang bang

[Verse 2]
This ain't nothin' to us cause we (gang bang)
So don't fuck with us if you don't (gang bang)
My momma ask me why I gotta (gang bang)
Cause I can't make no money and still (gang bang)
But for my dead homies gotta (gang bang)
Cause I know they was on the same thang
Ridin' focus, I can't even change lanes
Forgiatos, fully autos, bang bang
This one's for my niggas
I woulda said it was for the bitches but I dont got shit for the bitches
Shame all on you niggas all on the Instagram stuntin' for them bitches
Frontin' under pictures
And you can catch me over east my nigga
Don't like talkin' under pictures
If he was a threat, we'll get on that left by where he living
All I know is hustle, move it by the muscle
I won't move a muscle have my shooters touch you
I got nina with me, I know she don't trust you
Nina nice and little but she still'll fuck you
Glizzy's with the drums, play with them for fun
Got so many guns I don't know which one
Tahoes in them chops, ridin' flippin' blocks
If we see the opps make some windows drop

[Pre-Hook]
And who this nigga approachin'? Don't know him
If he do somethin' put infrared on him
He make a move and you know we start blowin'
They rollin', they rollin', they rollin', they rollin'
Bitch in my section and I know she on me
After I stroke her, leave her pussy soakin'
Suck me up then and we gone fuck til the mornin'
I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin', we rollin'

[Hook]
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm bussin' it's bussin', I'm bussin' it's bussin'
Somebody pass me a water or something
I'm bussin', I'm bussin', I'm bussin', it's bussin'
Somebody pass me a water or something
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
I'm rollin, I'm rollin I'm rollin, I'm rollin
Now everywhere I go, I'm with my niggas
Everywhere I go, I let my chain swang
You a fuck nigga, stay in your lane
This ain't nothin' to us cause we gang bang
