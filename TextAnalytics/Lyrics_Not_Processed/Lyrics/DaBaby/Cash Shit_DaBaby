Call him a trick and he don't get off', hold up
Bitch, I'm a star, got these niggas wishin'

I don't be stressin' 'bout none of these niggas
When they be talkin', I don't even listen
Tellin' me secrets, I probably forget it
But I'ma tune in when he say he gon' lick it
He told 'em send me a pic 'cause he miss me
I told him send me a stack if he really
I don't be trusting these tricks 'cause they tricky
Send him a pic of somebody else titties
I'm a finesser and I'm a fly dresser
Move to the top floor and flew in my dresser
My bitches hustle, make money together
Your bitches birds and they flockin' together
I can't decide if I want the new Louis
Dapper Dan yellow, I'm always in Gucci
Your mama don't bring your dad to the mall
'Cause when he be in there she know he be choosin'
