[Intro: YNW Melly]
Chopsquad
Young Grizzley World, baby (Young Grizzley Word)
No, no, no (Young Grizzley World, baby)
No, no, no, no, no, no (Young Grizzley World, baby)
No, no, no (Young Grizzley World, baby)
Nowadays, niggas change on the gang
Switch lanes, then come in and try to hang with us
Nigga ain't really with that shit
On that snake shit, fake ass nigga, that ain't what's up
(Young Grizzley World, baby)
Pussy nigga, that ain't what's up, oh
(Young Nigga World, baby)

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
Nowadays, niggas change for the fame
Niggas switch on the gang, then come and try to hang with us
He was just rich two years ago
Now the nigga in the middle of the road on angel dust
We ain't had shit, we was on our dick
And them hoes ain't even really wanna hang with us
Niggas switch on some snake shit, fake shit
Hell nah, pussy ass nigga, that ain't what's up
Nigga fuckin' with the crew, say he really with the shit
Hell nah, we a clique full of murderers
Don't trust my nigga, my niggas really creep
They slime, and they will murder ya
Nigga sayin' that he body bagging, toe-tagging shit, fuck nigga
But we ain't ever heard of ya
You can keep all the stories to yourself, fuck nigga
You ain't on that shit, we never heard of ya
Pussy jit, we ain't heard of ya
Fuck nigga, we ain't heard of ya
Fuck nigga, we ain't heard of ya
Clique full of murderers
Fuck nigga, we ain't heard of ya

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
I got a new bitch for the summer
They wait for the bus and they throw me right under
My watch and baguettes, I don't know what's exactly the price
But it cost me way over a hundred
Bro had the drink, I had thought it was soda
I sipped it and felt like I was in a coma
I'm covered in water, I need me a floater
She suckin' my dick and I don't even know her
All my guys ride
You fight, I fight
I'm fly, you're fly
My guys, my guys
My guys, fight if I fight
Kill, stab, die, die
I tried too many times
I cried too many times

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
Nigga watch who you play with (Stop playin')
Before I catch a premeditated (Bah)
Got a lot of niggas dead and I still see they faces (Woo)
I'm a rap star, I could've been a mental patient
Hit you with the bag, you still ain't paid me (What?)
You must want a nigga come and do you like a stranger
I ain't even trippin', money older than a pager
Niggas see you shine and forget you really dangerous
They won't let you help 'em (They won't let you help 'em)
They gon' make you nail 'em (Fuck it, go'n kill him)
My nigga got life, he call every day
I don't know what to tell him (I can't help my nigga)
We gon' get more time than murder, they catch us with this shit we sellin' (We gotta be level)
Y'all went from high school to college
We went from babies to felons, nigga (That's on my mama)
I done really survived everything these streets offered (Did all that shit)
I been through the mud, almost gave up
I done really survived everything these streets offered (Did all that shit)
I been caged up (Yeah), I done dodged them slugs (Yeah, ayy)

[Verse 3: YNW Melly]
I got a nine hour, I got a nine hour
I got a nine hour flight
I got a nine hour, I got a nine hour
I got a nine hour flight
Load up the K, load up the carbon
This shit is off the dome
D caught a body, Trell caught a body
My niggas ain't comin' home
I know that Lil Trell comin' home
But they give Lil D fifty years
His mama keep cryin' them tears (Start cryin' on me)
His mama keep cryin' them tears (Start cryin', ah)
It's a Draco in the back of the car
And the police here behind you
Better do what you do, better run, or skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Boy, you better run
Lil' Melly comin' for ya
And he strapped up with the gun
An anaconda in your circle, and you don't even know
They tryna snake ya, take your money, but they claim they your bro
And where was she when a young nigga was so damn broke?
And where was she when a nigga ain't have no hope? Huh
Dirty mattress (Yeah, slatt, slatt)
Man, these pussy niggas actin' (Man, these pussy niggas actin')
Ho, hell nah, ain't no lackin'
Big B's, double-oh-twenty, baby, what's brackin'?
Fuck boy get 
actin'
Pick him up like some motherfuckin' laundry
Nigga play, hell nah, Armanis
These hoes gon' fuck up our lease
Balenciagas, Saint Laurents
This bitch wanna fuck, she rollin' my blunts
I don't even smoke, you like to toke
We totin' the tommy gun, got free smoke for anyone

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
Nowadays, niggas change for the fame
Niggas switch on the gang, then come and try to hang with us
He was just rich two years ago
Now the nigga in the middle of the road on angel dust
We ain't had shit, we was on our dick
