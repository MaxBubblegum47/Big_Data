[Intro]
Loved each other way more than we loved life
Was so close, people thought we had a love life
We loved each other way more than we loved life
Helluva made this beat, baby
Still do (Ayy, JB)

[Verse 1]
I used to be like, "I don't need security" (Street niggas)
I don't want these niggas thinking that it's fear in me (At all)
Told my driver, "Be on point," he wasn't hearing' me (Driver)
Those shots went off, I'm steady callin', you ain't answerin', you scarin' me (Hello?)
In my city, if you winnin', you can't stay
They call bein' broke, "Real," they call gettin' money, "Fake"
I gave you a bitch, why you still lookin' at my date?
I gave you some food, why you still lookin' at my plate, nigga?
They say they love us, but that love might be hate
I can't really tell the difference, salt and sugar look the same
 (It's tricky)
Look how they did Dex
, 
look how they did Blade (Damn)
Look how they tried to do me, but got JB
Man, that jealousy so real, man, that hate so deep
Man, that envy shit so real, you make it out these streets
You saw it wasn't me and still shot, what she do to you? (What she do to you?)
We was just winnin', now I'm cryin' at your funeral
But every tear I shed another thousand on your head, nigga (That's on my fuckin' mama)
Now show your face and think I'm playin', nigga
Every tear I shed another thousand on your head, boy (On my daddy grave)
Now show your face and think I'm playin'
Ayy, JB, I wish I was sittin' outside with you
And I was in that bank with you
You know your favorite rapper wouldn't have never let them guys get you
I would've shot 'em, left 'em dyin', leakin' in the street
Wouldn't have ran, would've smoke the Runtz and watch that man go to sleep
And you think they came for her? Man, you know they came for me
They took my heart and my brains, niggas know that I can't think
How I'm playin' with these drums, niggas know I'm like Tay Keith
Eyes bloodshot red, niggas know I ain't been sleepin'
But all these dead loved ones make it hard to sleep (Make it hard to sleep)
All this anger inside make it hard to grieve (Make it hard to grieve)
Ayy, all this nicotine make it hard to breathe (Make it hard to breathe)
All these tears in my eyes make it hard to sleep (Make it hard to sleep)
They found a murder weapon, bro, it's gon' be hard to beat (It's gon' be hard to beat)
First offer fifty years, so it's hard to plea, ayy (It's gon' be hard to plea)
And if they do somethin' to us, then they known for it (They known for it)
But if we do somethin' to them, then we wrong for it (Then we wrong for it)

[Chorus]
Fuck that, if you take mines, I take yours, homie (I take yours, homie)
Then gon' pray to the Lord, "Don't be too hard on me" (Please)
Yeah, you drop one, I drop four, homie (I drop four, homie)
They be like, "God, please don't be too hard on me" (Please)

[Verse 2]
If we tear this bitch up, they gon' say I'm dead wrong (Dead wrong)
Fuck that, these niggas got my auntie with a headstone (Damn)
Niggas tellin' me what to do like they smart as me (What?)
But they ain't take your heart from you, they took my heart from me (Bitch)
I got one less person that wanted more from me
Ready to kill whoever play with me or shorted me (Don't play)
I got your kids, I got Nanni, I got Nell too
I got your babies, Kee and Zi and Gabrielle too (Oh)
I got your sister and your mommy and your fam' too (I got 'em)
How the fuck you gon' die on me? I can't stand you (Damn)
I pray they don't go to jail, I want 'em dead
I'm just listenin' to the streets, hearin' everything they sayin'
I'm just waitin' on a name, I'm just prayin' that they say it
Give a fuck if it's the Mayor, nigga, million on his head, ayy, ayy (Whole ticket on his top)
Wish I could wake you up and beat your ass
'Cause I was just tellin' you about them dreams I had (Free my mama)
Ayy, niggas snatched my heart out my chest, can't nobody replace it
Wouldn't have ever believed you was fuckin' with your baby
"Make sure Tee good" is all I ever heard you sayin'
Tryna hold my head, I don't know if I'ma make it (Mhm)
This shit been eatin' me (Eatin' up)
I don't know what you seen in me, but you believed in me ('Lieved in me)
Tell them "Keep that fake love, let me grieve in peace" (Fuck that shit)

[Chorus]
You drop mines, I drop yours, homie (I drop yours)
You drop one, I drop four, homie (I drop it four)
Then be like, "God, please don't be too hard on me" (God, please)
God, please don't close the door on me (Please)
