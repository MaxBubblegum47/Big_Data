[Intro: YNW Melly & Tee Grizzley]
Coolin' in the cut with my shooters (Bah)
(Yeah, I fuck with this beat)
(I don't even know who the fuck on this bitch)
(Grizzley? Hahaha)
Boolin' in the cut with my shooters (Bah-bah-bah)
Thirty clip hangin' out the Ruger (Brrt)
And I got a clique full of shooters (Brrt)
And I'm in your dreams, Freddy Krueger (Bah)
Fuckin' with my niggas, bet they do ya

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
Coolin' in the cut with my shooters (Cut with my shooters)
Thirty clip hangin' out the Ruger (Right out my Ruger)
And I'm in yo dreams, Freddy Krueger (Slimes on your Ave)
Don't fuck with me, my young niggas'll do ya
Blood they gon' do ya, my young niggas'll do ya
Do ya, do ya, do ya, my young niggas'll do ya (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
She on her knees and she screaming hallelujah (She screaming)
She on her knees and she screaming hallelujah

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
Posted in the alley with that Draco (Brrat)
We comfortable in places niggas can't go (Pull up)
Touch my nigga, Melly, let that thang go (Bow, bow)
These rap niggas pussy, where your chain go?
The spots in Detroit, I supply them (Dope)
I'm talking loud we going by him (Come here)
Can't cook but I'm gonna fry him (Bitch)
My advice, don't stand by him (Don't)
Fifty round chopper clip big on the K
Niggas talk crazy on the 'Gram every day
See the stick with me like I got a kid on the way
Fuck that, see if he can talk shit from the grave
Don't come over here tryna flex (Don't do it)
You gon' get all that shit took (Gimme that!)
Used to get sauce from the west (Dope)
Shoot it to the east, get it cooked (Hard)
Monday through Friday I'm booked (Facts)
Ninety on the skelly, how it look? (Bling)
Still pull a kick door quick
Drop everybody in the house, John Wick (Bow)

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
Coolin' in the cut with my shooters (Cut with my shooters)
Thirty clip hangin' out the Ruger (Right out my Ruger)
And I'm in yo dreams, Freddy Krueger (Slimes on your Ave)
Don't fuck with me, my young niggas'll do ya
Blood they gon' do ya, my young niggas'll do ya
Do ya, do ya, do ya, my young niggas'll do ya (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
She on her knees and she screaming hallelujah (She screaming)
She on her knees and she screaming hallelujah

[Interlude: YNW Melly]
Ayy, hold the fuck up, man
Ayy, hold up, man, stop the beat real quick, hold up

[Verse 2: YNW Melly]
Free my nigga D, he caught a body (Slatt, slatt)
Bitch, I'm booted in the cut like I'm Scotty
Free my nigga, free my nigga, yeah, he due (He due)
And I got a mystery like ooh (Like ooh)
In a van, with a stick, with my dog, Scooby-Doo (Ooh)
And that bitch gon' slurp that dick just like a flurry (A flurry)
And my diamonds VVS, they ain't blurry (Water)
Heard you signed a deal with the white man
And they sayin' that you're Illuminati (No)
Boy, don't listen to them fucking critics
They gon' make me and Grizzley catch a body
I just be rolling, I be sober (Sober)
My mama's house got put inside foreblosure (Blatt)
I'm a blood so you know that means foreclosure (Suwoo)
Don't fuck with us, them Detroit niggas slump you over (They'll slump you over)
That pussy mushy, gushy, nasty like some yogurt (Just like some yogurt)
I up the Glock and leave your ass looking like you did yoga (Oh)
I don't want no pressure, hell no, my slime gon' slump you over (Slatt, yeah, slump you over)
Where we at, we eatin' lovely (Lovely)
Fuck your bitch from the back and hit my Dougie (Yeah, yeah)
I am not your boyfriend, bitch, you just my buddy (Just my buddy, bitch)
And a nigga no Blac Youngsta but I'm tryna Kid Kid Cudi (Cudi)

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
Coolin' in the cut with my shooters (Cut with my shooters)
Thirty clip hangin' out the Ruger (Right out my Ruger)
And I'm in yo dreams, Freddy Krueger (Slimes on your Ave)
Don't fuck with me, my young niggas'll do ya
Blood they gon' do ya, my young niggas'll do ya
Do ya, do ya, do ya, my young niggas'll do ya (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
She on her knees and she screaming hallelujah (She screaming)
She on her knees and she screaming hallelujah
