[Verse 1]
You said just put the ball in the ref's hand
When you cross that goal line
Just lay the bat down, touch 'em all
When you go yard for the first time
You said I see the rebel in you like me
You're gonna stir up a little hell
Remember stand tall and chest out
When they throw you in the jail cell

[Chorus]
Like you've been there before
Like it ain't no thing
Like it ain't your first trip around that block
Keep a grip on your cool like a ball and a chain
On that ankle, a convict breaking rock
Roll with it, don't let it show
Like it ain't your first rodeo
Like the Cowboys in '94
Like you've been there before

[Verse 2]
You said play a little hard to get
When you find the one you need
And don't take what she don't wanna give
And boy take it easy in the backseat

[Chorus]
Like you've been there before
Like it ain't no thing
Like it ain't your first trip around that block
Keep a grip on your cool like a ball and a chain
On that ankle, a convict breaking rock
Roll with it, don't let it show
Like it ain't your first rodeo
Like Earnhardt in '94
Like you've been there before
That's right

[Verse 3]
You said I pray you find a girl, son
Like your mama, she's the real deal
The kind that's in it for the long run
The kind that makes heaven feel
Like you've been there before

[Chorus]
Like you've been there before
Like it ain't no thing
Like it ain't your first trip around that block
Keep a grip on your cool like a ball and a chain
On that ankle, a convict breaking rock
Roll with it, don't let it show
Like it ain't your first rodeo
Like a soldier going back to war
Like you've been there before
Like the Cowboys in '94
Like you've been there before

[Outro]
Yeah
Like you've been there before
