[Verse 1]
I had every Eagles record
Center console in a stack
When we split up, she still had Desperado
And I never asked for it back
So I'm missing one

[Verse 2]
She's the reason that I quit 'em
Yeah she was always on my ass
But she ain't here to check my jacket pocket
So I bought a brand new pack
Now it's missing one
Oh yeah I'm missing one

[Chorus]
I hate the way it hurts like hell
I wanna want somebody else
Girls in here can't help tonight
Cause I'm missing one

[Verse 3]
It used to race like Kentucky
And it'd go crazy in her arms
Skipping beats sending thunder through these veins
Back when I had a heart
Now I'm missing one
Oh yeah I'm missing one

[Chorus]
I hate the way it hurts like hell
I wanna want somebody else
Girls in here can't help tonight
Cause I'm missing one, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah I'm missing one, missing one, missing one
Yeah I'm missing one, missing one, missing one
Oh I'm missing one, missing one, missing one

[Chorus]
I hate the way it hurts like hell
I wanna want somebody else
Girls in here can't help tonight
Cause I'm missing one
Oh I'm missing one, yeah
Oh I'm missing one, missing one, missing one
