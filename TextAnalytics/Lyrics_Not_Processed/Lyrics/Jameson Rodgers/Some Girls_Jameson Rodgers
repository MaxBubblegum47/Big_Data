[Verse 1]
Pictures on her phone and tears in her eyes
Waterproof makeup ain't made for a breakup on a Saturday night
Then it's hey how you been, good how 'bout you
Funny how seeing you once after a few months
Gets you locked out
Right back to telling folks you know I know
All about some new guy taking you out
Then you unfollow me then follow me back
Just so I know you're still around

[Chorus]
Some girls get their mama on the phone
Take a trip back home, pretend they never knew the guy
Some girls drink a bottle of wine
Got an old ex to text to get 'em through the getting by
Sometimes it's a clean break, stay gone
Clean slate moving on to something new
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
But some girls never do

[Verse 2]
Some hearts stay broke, some hearts don't skip a beat
Some people say goodbye then try to make it alright
Just like you're doing to me, but tonight I'm letting it ring

[Chorus]
Some girls get their mama on the phone
Take a trip back home, pretend they never knew the guy
Some girls drink a bottle of wine
Got an old ex to text to get 'em through the getting by
Sometimes it's a clean break, stay gone
Clean slate, moving on to something new
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
But some girls never do
No some girls never do

[Bridge]
Yeah some girls know when they've got something
Worth holding on to, but some girls never do

[Chorus]
Some girls get their mama on the phone
Take a trip back home, pretend they never knew the guy
Some girls drink a bottle of wine
Got an old ex to text to get 'em through the getting by
Sometimes it's a clean break, stay gone
Clean slate, moving on to something new
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
But some girls never do

[Outro]
Yeah some girls never do
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
But some girls never do
