[Chorus: HARDY]
Take me down where the beer is cold
The fish get fried and the fireflies glow
Roll me down an old outta town road
Show me where the river runs

[Verse 1: HARDY]
I need a break from the loud and the mad
And the fast interstates and a big town
I'm just a down-homesick, tryna-make-a-buck boy
Lookin’ for a little slow down
Need to trade a skyscraper for a silo
Couple stop lights, only three or four or five-oh
Need to hear a little "ma'am" after "no"
And pump before you pay at the Texaco

[Chorus: HARDY]
Take me down where the beer is cold
The fish get fried and the fireflies glow
Roll me down an old outta town road
Show me where the river runs
Somewhere the dirt'll stain your boot soles
Red like the words I was raised up on
Back porch at night, singin’ with the crickets
That kinda life is my kinda livin', yeah
Yeah, that kinda life is my kinda livin'
Yeah, that kinda life is my kinda livin'

[Verse 2: Hunter Phelps]
Yeah, I've been throwin' windshield waves
At strangers in the other lane, but they never wave back
It's all "y'all" and "yonder" rollin’ off my lips
I need a trip where people still say that
Less busy, more laid back

[Chorus: Hunter Phelps]
Take me down where the beer is cold
The fish get fried and the fireflies glow
Roll me down an old outta town road
Show me where the river runs
Somewhere the dirt’ll stain your boot soles
Red like the words I was raised up on
Mason jar lightnin', cast iron skillets
That kinda life is my kinda livin’
Yeah, that kinda life is my kinda livin'
Yeah, that kinda life is my kinda livin'

[Bridge: Jameson Rodgers]
If I ain't built a house on a hill out there
By the time I take my last breath
Put me in a pine box, say a little prayer
And fulfill my last request (Take me down)

[Chorus: Jameson Rodgers]
Take me down where the beer is cold
The fish get fried and the fireflies glow (The fireflies glow)
Roll me down an old outta town road
Show me where the river runs (Where the river runs)
Somewhere the dirt’ll stain your boot soles (Hey)
Red like the words I was raised up on
Leave my headstone with one thing written
That kinda life is my kinda livin', yeah
Yeah, that kinda life is my kinda livin'
Yeah, that kinda life is my kinda livin', mmm
