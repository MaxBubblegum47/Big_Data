[Verse 1]
You see I'm at the bar when you walk in
Already drinking for free
Looking like trouble with her girlfriends
And for good ole' boys like me

[Bridge]
They're always wearing something short and sexy
When they walk up and ask you if you've got a light
They love to dance, when they get the chance
They'll wreck your heart and your Saturday night

[Chorus]
Gotta quit hanging with them girls that smoke
Stealing little sips out your whiskey and Coke
They'll burn you down to ashes, man it ain't no joke
Gotta quit hanging with them girls that smoke

[Verse 2]
I just put a five on the pool game
But I might as well kiss it goodbye
'cos I just caught her looking over my way
Now it's just a matter of time

[Bridge]
They're always wearing something short and sexy
When they walk up and ask you if you've got a light
They love to dance, when they get the chance
They'll wreck your heart and your Saturday night

[Chorus]
Gotta quit hanging with them girls that smoke
Stealing little sips out your whiskey and Coke
They'll burn you down to ashes, man it ain't no joke
Gotta quit hanging with them girls that smoke

[Bridge 2]
She's empty now
She'll let you spin her around
Everybody you can bet
When they play the last song
The lights kick on
She'll put you out like a cigarette

[Chorus]
Gotta quit hanging out with them girls that smoke
Stealing little sips out your whiskey and Coke
They'll burn you down to ashes, man it ain't no joke

[Bridge]
They're always wearing something short and sexy
When they walk up and ask you if you've got a light
They love to dance when they get the chance
But they'll wreck your heart and your Saturday night

[Chorus]
Gotta quit hanging out with them girls that smoke
Stealing little sips out your whiskey and Coke
They'll burn you down to ashes, man it ain't no joke
Gotta quit hanging with them girls that smoke
