[Verse 1]
Yeah, I wonder if
My name has ever crossed your mind
Even for a second
Know it's been a second
Since we last talked
Or faced each other eye to eye
Know it's been hectic
Yeah, I shoulda said this

[Pre-Chorus]
It kinda hurts 'cause it's insane
Yeah, we walk by and it's like
I don't even know you
Like I've never met you
I see our pictures on my phone
And question why we didn't try
But we were just habits
Thought we'd always have it

[Chorus]
So to my ex-best friend
I thought I'd know til the end
Sorry I know things aren't going as we planned
To my once ride or die
The one who always knew me right
We would swear it'd always end up you and I
We really messed up this time

[Post-Chorus]
We really messed up this time

[Verse 2]
What about all the nights
Where we'd talked about our lives?
We were just wishing
Wish I would have listened

[Pre-Chorus]
It kinda hurts 'cause it's insane
Yea we walk by and it's like
I don't even know you
Like I've never met you
I see our pictures on my phone
And question why we didn't try
But we were just habits
Thought we'd always have it

[Chorus]
So to my ex-best friend
I thought I'd know till the end
Sorry I know things aren't going as we planned
To my once ride or die
The one who always knew me right
We would swear it'd always end up you and I
We really messed up this time
