[Verse 1]
I've been keeping things inside
Taking up space 'til I got someone
I could open my mind up to
I guess it worked pretty good 'til now
But shit's kinda getting serious
I think I'm running out of room

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyone's got someone built custom
To give their darkness to
I wish I had someone, could trust 'em
But loyalty don't come for free

[Chorus]
'Cause all my friends are fake, fake, fake, fake
They just want me for the day, day, until they don't
I stay up wondering
What if I broke my legs?
What if I changed my name?
Would you still love me the same?
Or are you just as fake?
Like, all my friends are fake

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I got you wrong
Didn't mean to judge you by a cover
I've been burnt so many times
It's hard to turn it off

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyone's got people they see through
But I see through everyone
So if you want me to believe you and need you
Might take some time to recognize

[Chorus]
'Cause all my friends are fake, fake, fake, fake
They just want me for the day, day, until they don't
I stay up wondering
What if I broke my legs?
What if I changed my name?
Would you still love me the same?
Or are you just as fake?
Like, all my friends are fake

[Bridge]
Sorry if I got you wrong
Didn't mean to judge you by a cover
I've been burnt so many times
It's hard to turn it off

[Chorus]
All my friends are fake, fake, fake, fake
They just want me for the day, day, until they don't
I stay up wondering
What if I broke my legs?
What if I changed my name?
Would you still love me the same?
Or are you just as fake?
Like, all my friends are fake
Like, all my friends are fake
