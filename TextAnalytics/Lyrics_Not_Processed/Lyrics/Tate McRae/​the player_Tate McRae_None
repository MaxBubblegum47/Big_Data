[Verse 1]
Hey, guess we haven't talked in awhile
Maybe you've been missin' my smile
But lately that's been harder to do
I see that you've been talkin' with her
Why? Bet you don't even remember
Guess that's what happens with you

[Pre-Chorus]
All my friends, they warned me you were no good
But I didn't believe that you would

[Chorus]
Be the player that plays with the games in our heads
The faker that makes you do things you'll regret
The player, player
The player, player
The person that leads you to think that they're real
Leadin' you on to control how you feel
To break her, break her
Like the player you are

[Verse 2]
Did you actually think that I'd care enough
To spend all my hours thinkin' of us?
Oh, boy, you've got it all wrong
Just wanted to let you know I'm fed up
With all the 3 A.M. talks 'cause
They dragged on for way too long

[Pre-Chorus]
All my friends, they warned me you were no good
But I didn't believe that you would

[Chorus]
Be the player that plays with the games in our heads
The faker that makes you do things you'll regret
The player, player
The player, oh
The person that leads you to think that they're real
Leadin' you on to control how you feel
To break her, break her
Like the player you are
