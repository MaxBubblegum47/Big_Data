[Verse 1]
People ask me all the time
What do you look for in a guy?
And honestly I got no type
But in my head this is what I describe

[Chorus]
I want those late nights and long drives
Starin' at your goddamn smile
Makin’ me fall harder than the first time
And playlists with the music
Our parents gotten used to it
Whisper in my ear, I'll never lose you
I'll steal all your hoodies
We’ll laugh 'til we can't breathe
Makin' me feel stupid when you tease me

[Post-Chorus]
But I ain't lookin' for perfect, the perfect picture
Just someone who'll be there when I get home
And I ain't lookin’ for perfect, just a mixture
Of a shoulder and a hand that I can hold, tonight

[Verse 2]
They say I’m unapproachable
But I'm not the girl who gets emotional
And if I like you then my walls won’t close
So let's just see how this goes

[Chorus]
I want those late nights and long drives
Starin' at your goddamn smile
Makin' me fall harder than the first time
And playlists with the music
Our parents gotten used to it
Whisper in my ear, I’ll never lose you
I'll steal all your hoodies
We'll laugh until we can't breathe
Makin' me feel stupid when you tease me

[Post-Chorus]
But I ain't lookin' for perfect, the perfect picture
Just someone who'll be there when I get home
And I ain't lookin' for perfect, just a mixture
Of a shoulder and a hand that I can hold, tonight
