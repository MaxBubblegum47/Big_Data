[Intro]
JD On Tha Track
Iceberg want a 
bag
, bitch

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 1: Polo G]
She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace
Lil' bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 2: Lil TJay]
I call lil' bro, he said he ready for the stain (Said he ready for the stain)
What you claim? You a lame, you ain't never put in pain (Put in pain)
Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state (State) 'cause I had a bag to make (Bag to make)
I risked my life but it's aight 'cause God ain't let me pass away (Pass away)
Fuck tomorrow, spin the block, just know we comin' back today (Back today)
I call Polo, he come dolo, we get 'em the fast way

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane
