Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, for you, I would've done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, while I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring

[Chorus]
You think I'm stupid, bitch now you really a dub
I don't want none of your love
I can name all of the lies you have told me
It's crazy 'cause I really gave you my trust
Before the fame, you ain't think I would make it
But baby girl, now I'ma show you what's up
And it's a shame I just had to be patient, I swear on my momma I'm 'bout to blow up
You think I'm stupid, bitch now you really a dub
I don't want none of your love
I can name all of the lies you have told me
It's crazy 'cause I really gave you my trust
Before the fame, you ain't think I would make it
But baby girl, now I'ma show you what's up
And it's a shame I just had to be patient, I swear on my momma I'm 'bout to blow up

[Verse]
I'ma make something from nothin', you tried to say you was there but you wasn't
I would've gave you a kid, we was rushin'
Sleepin' with niggas, I swear it's disgustin'
Bitch, now you broke, where the paper you touchin'?
I could be grimy and fuck with your cousin
But nah, I'ma just focus on me, yeah, that's rappin' and shit
Time to get money and laugh at the bitch
And I swear I worked hard, had to practice for this
I be the type to assassin a bitch
I remember the time when I was clappin' your shit
With your archin' your back on my mattress and shit
And I'ma get money regardless, you part of the reason I'm heartless
Now it's time to throw money in Starlet's
And these other lil' niggas is garbage
You was there when I was fightin' my charges
I was stuck in that jail for a year long, I was treatin' you like you my real jawn
And you throwin' no money for bail bond
But I'm still goin', still flowin'
Run up on me and I'm still blowin'
Baby, baby, baby, baby, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, for you, I would've done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, while I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring

[Chorus]
You think I'm stupid, bitch now you really a dub
I don't want none of your love
I can name all of the lies you have told me
It's crazy 'cause I really gave you my trust
Before the fame, you ain't think I would make it
But baby girl, now I'ma show you what's up
And it's a shame I just had to be patient, I swear on my momma I'm 'bout to blow up
You think I'm stupid, bitch now you really a dub
I don't want none of your love
I can name all of the lies you have told me
It's crazy 'cause I really gave you my trust
Before the fame, you ain't think I would make it
But baby girl, now I'ma show you what's up
And it's a shame I just had to be patient, I swear on my momma I'm 'bout to blow up
