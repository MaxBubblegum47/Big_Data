[Intro]
Sonic

[Chorus]
And I heard that a nigga wanna battle me, my nigga you 'gon lose
'Cause a dude walk around in savagery, my niggas clappin' tools
And I walk around with this ratchet on me 'cause I got the juice
And I told that bitch don't lie to me, lil' bitch, you tell the truth
Bitch, I'm grindin' and I hope you understand
But fuck that love shit, I'ma leave it in the past
I've been trappin', lil' bitch, yeah, I'm in my bag
Niggas disrespect, I swear that 40 blast
Use your head 'fore I take it off your neck
I'm a OG, they gon' pay me my respect
Lil Bro OC and he run around with that tech
Keep it lowkey, but you fuck around and be next

[Verse]
Bitch, I come from bendin' blocks, and sendin' shots
Tell 'em we only duck from cops, we send shots at opps, ayy
Watch a nigga fall, watch his body drop, ayy
She gon' take my soul, lick it like a lollipop
Ain't no losin' focus, bitch, I'm on it
Put my wrist in motion, 'cause I want it frozen
Niggas know I ball, like DeRozan
Niggas swear they hard, but they foldin'

[Chorus]
And I heard that a nigga wanna battle me, my nigga you 'gon lose
'Cause a dude walk around in savagery, my niggas clappin' tools
And I walk around with this ratchet on me 'cause I got the juice
And I told that bitch don't lie to me, lil' bitch, you tell the truth
Bitch, I'm grindin' and I hope you understand
But fuck that love shit, I'ma leave it in the past
I've been trappin', lil' bitch, yeah, I'm in my bag
Niggas disrespect, I swear that 40 blast
Use your head 'fore I take it off your neck
I'm a OG, they gon' pay me my respect
Lil Bro OC and he run around with that tech
Keep it lowkey, but you fuck around and be next
