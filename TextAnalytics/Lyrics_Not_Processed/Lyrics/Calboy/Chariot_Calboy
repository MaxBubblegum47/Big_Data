[Intro]
P-P-Papamitrou, boy

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Fresh out the trap and they know how I carry it
I fell in love with the game and I married it
200 thou' for the walk on a Saturday
I threw the wrap on the Phantom, it's matte today
Pushin' that bitch through the 'jects like a chariot
Diamonds on diamonds, they comin' in various
I gave that bitch $20,000 for charity
Counted me out and I'm back, and I'm havin' it, ayy

[Verse 1: Calboy]
I'm from the trenches where I had to get it
I'm so used to trappin', I get it and flip it
I know that you be actin', I know you ain't with it
Bro, throw me the package, I wrap it and flip it
They say I got money so I'm actin' different
Get it by my lonely, so I never listen
Stay callin' my phone, this lil' bitch, she trippin'
Just leave me alone, I'm handlin' business
Work hard, I gotta get it (I gotta get it)
Trap hard, we in the kitchen
Diamonds so cold, light even bend
And my niggas don't fold, they never bendin'
Took a loss, but shit happens, I get it
With the bosses, I'm payin' attention
Told that bitch I ain't wastin' no time
So, no, I can't wait, not a minute
And I pray to the Lord for better days
I'm flexin' hard like a heavyweight
Spent some racks and I bust down the bezel face
Got this .30 on me, make 'em run away, yeah
Bitch, I'm gettin' paid
I was in the trap whippin' shit like a slave
Can't put trust in these bitches, these bitches changed
On the block with them niggas, was goin' insane, yeah
I ain't come to play
Can't fuck with lil' shawty, she in the way (You in the way)
No time to waste
Gotta get to this money, I'm runnin' late, yeah (I'm runnin' late)
Better keep a K
Boy, these bullets get drawn like anime
I'ma hop in that foreign and do the race
Yeah, I got the Bentley, Meek got the Wraith, yeah

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Fresh out the trap and they know how I carry it
I fell in love with the game and I married it
200 thou' for the walk on a Saturday
I threw the wrap on the Phantom, it's matte today
Pushin' that bitch through the 'jects like a chariot
Diamonds on diamonds, they comin' in various
I gave that bitch $20,000 for charity
Counted me out and I'm back, and I'm havin' it, ayy

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Woo, ayy
Fuck on a private jet
Then he hop in his 'Gatti with a jet motor (Rrt)
Ayy, I just had bought out the plug
I got enough drugs to never be sober, yeah
I can't hop in with a scrub
I don't carry dubs in none of my clothin', yeah
I told this bitch to cool off
She was overexcited 'bout my golds, yeah, uh (Woo)
Choke on the beans, I'm fuckin' her friend
They doin' my chores, yeah
He fresh out the can and I gave him a wifey
Nigga, that's yours, yeah (No cap)
I sleep with a K and a couple grenades
I'm ready for war, yeah
Nipsey blue Range Rover SVR
Racks in the safe, I stack it like Lays
My diamonds all colors like a gay parade (Woo)
Go on your bitch, I could've just laid
But I alley-oop'd to my homie, he ate (He just scored)
I cooked that fishscale, he slimed out the plate
Got 52 watches and I still come in late
You a sassy bitch, but I don't go on dates
Diamonds canary, stone lemon cakes
Show me attention when I'm in your city
I'm so used to fuckin' on all of your bitches
They wanna fuck us and they know that we pimpin'
Giuseppe Zanotti, I cop by the 50, yeah
I work the backstreets in all of the cities
Yes, I paid for her thighs, lips, ass, and her titties, yeah
Skydweller get wet as Pacific
I ain't sold a drug, but my wrist on the chicken, yeah (Woo, woo)

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Lil Durk]
Fresh out the trap and they know how I carry it
I fell in love with the game and I married it
200 thou' for the walk on a Saturday
I threw the wrap on the Phantom, it's matte today
Pushin' that bitch through the 'jects like a chariot
Diamonds on diamonds, they comin' in various
I gave that bitch $20,000 for charity (Yeah, yeah)
Counted me out and I'm back, and I'm havin' it, ayy (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
Look at my clarity, my diamonds is serious
I got out of jail and I fucked on her period
I know they racist, Gucci interior
Came from a corner to ownin' my cereal
Meek, we don't need a stylist
Percs, weed, even my balance
Alexander McQueen Margielas (Yeah)
I kill in the streets, you tellin' (Skrrt)
Don't run, don't run
Make it home to my son (To my son)
I be with killers who kill other killers
I'm hangin' with Von
You'd rather buy the bitches back
I'd rather give a new house to my mom
Some niggas rather pray to the Bible
When I converted, I pray with my palms
See, keepin' my Glock when I'm in the field (Gang)
Hop in the Track and I burn out the wheels (Skrrt)
I fuck with the gangsters, don't fuck with my peers
Fresh out of Jeffrey's, I hop on the Lear
Grippin' that .40, not talkin' a beer
Flawless the diamonds, I boog out the ear
Bentley do wheelies, I pop it in gear
Eight in my cup when I'm walkin' through, clear
Mm-mm-mm-mm, this lifestyle
Man, that X is fuckin' my pupil
Just turn these lights down
I'm just a wild, wild boy
Chopper ridin' 'round for him
I need my mils like Meek
I'm a thug like Thug and Cal, Calboy

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Lil Durk]
Fresh out the trap and they know how I carry it (Trappin')
I fell in love with the game and I married it (Trappin')
200 thou' for the walk on a Saturday (Uh)
I threw the wrap on the Phantom, it's matte today (Oh)
Pushin' that bitch through the 'jects like a chariot (Yeah)
Diamonds on diamonds, they comin' in various (Clear)
I gave that bitch $20,000 for charity (Gave the bitch)
Counted me out and I'm back, and I'm havin' it, ayy (Uh oh)

[Outro: Lil Durk]
Mm-mm, uh oh
Mm-mm, uh oh
Mm-mm, uh oh
