[Intro: Vedo, 
with Natasha Mosley
]
Yeah
Don't worry
Ain't nobody gon' know
You ready? Come on
Oh, no, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1: Natasha Mosley, 
Vedo
]
You know I got that act right
That be home by three
That put you straight to sleep (
Is that right?
)
You know I got that love me long time
So, how deep is your love? Come show me what's up
And if I give it to you, promise you won't tell nobody
'Cause it ain't nobody business
Want you to touch all the right spots
Guaranteed to make you hot
Go on and dive deep, I know you feel me

[Pre-Chorus: Natasha Mosley]
Can't nobody do my body like you do my body
Make love to me, make me forget about my problems
Your secret's safe with me
So what you tryna do? I'ma leave it up to you

[Chorus: Vedo, 
Natasha Mosley
]
These four walls (
Four walls
)
They gon' see everything, tell me all your fantasies (
Everything
)
These four walls (These four walls) (
Oh-oh-oh
)
They won't tell a soul, we can keep it on the low
Within these four walls
Hickeys on your neck
All the way down to your chest, baby
These four walls
They gon' hear you screaming "Yes"
Baby, you bring out the best (Behind these walls)

[Verse 2: Vedo]
Put on some 
12 Play
, I got what you want
I hear your body (Calling), calling for me (Ah-ah)
In the middle of the night 'cause you want that loving, loving
I'ma give it to you right, ain't no discussion, 'scussion
So, come over and leave your problems at the door
Leave your emotions in the hallway
Throw your panties on the floor
'Cause I (I, I)
Want to make you feel like it's your first time (Woah-oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Vedo, 
with Natasha Mosley
]
Can't nobody do your body like I do your body (Oh-oh)
Make love to you, make you forget about your problems (Oh)
Your secret's safe with me
 (Woah-oh-oh)
So what you wanna do? Im gon' leave it up to you (Oh)

[Chorus: Vedo, 
Natasha Mosley
]
These four walls (These four walls)
They gon' see everything (
Everything
)
Tell me all your fantasies (Oh, no-no)
These four walls (These four walls) (Woah-oh-oh, na-na)
They won't tell a soul, we can keep it on the low (
Say "Yeah"
)
Within these four walls
Hickeys on your neck
All the way down to your chest, baby
These four walls (Yeah)
They gon' hear you screaming "Yes"
Baby, you bring out the best (Hey)

[Outro: Vedo, 
Natasha Mosley
]
These four walls (
Four walls
)
They gon' see everything (
Four walls
)
Tell me all your fantasies (
Four walls
)
These four walls (These four walls) (
Oh, right, yeah
)
They won't tell a soul, we can keep it on the low (
On the low
)
Within these four walls (
Ooh-ooh

Hickeys on your neck
All the way down to your chest, baby (
Right down to my chest, baby
)
These four walls (
Baby
)
They gon' hear you screaming "Yes"
Baby, you bring out the best (Behind these walls)
