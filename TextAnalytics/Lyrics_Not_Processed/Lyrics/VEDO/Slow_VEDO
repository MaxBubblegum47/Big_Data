[Intro]
Na Na Na Na     Na Na Na Na
Noooo ooohhh ye-yeahhh
Vedo baby (Rock me baby)
Look

[Verse 1]
You let niggas get the best
I know that you ain’t got much left
But I say fuck it I’ll do some construction
And work with it gimme the rest
Girl you need me and I need you too
I’ll play my part and I’ll wait for you
Yeah oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
Love you with my mind
Deep conversation tell me what you want
Kiss you with my body
Touch every spot, turn you on before I make love to you
Girl we'll become one when you ready, I won't pressure you
Girl, I ain’t got nothin' but time

[Chorus]
We can take it slow
'Cause I want much more from you
It’s been a while so baby
Girl let’s take it slow
Trust me girl ain’t no rush, ooh I’ll make time for us
We can take it slow, take it slow

[Verse 2]
Take my time make sure you get yours before I do
Girl I know exactly what to do
Turn off your phone, girl we don’t need no interruptions
Oh baby cuz I

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you right next to me
I want you all over me
Swim good when I’m divin' deep
Hold my breath don’t rescue me
Make you feel it in your knees
Please excuse the Hennessy
And I ain’t got nothin’ but time

[Chorus]
We can take it slow
'Cause I want much more from you
It’s been a while so baby
Girl let’s take it slow
Trust me girl ain’t no rush, ooh I’ll make time for us

[Bridge]
Kissin’ you (Slow)
Lovin’ you (Slow)
Touchin’ you (slow)
On top don't speed it up, go slow (Take your time)
Go slow (Look in the eyes)
Go slow
Girl I want all of you

[Chorus]
We can take it slow
Cuz I want much more from you
It’s been a while so baby
Girl let’s take it slow
Trust me girl ain’t no rush
Oh I’ll make time for us

Oh I make time
Take it slow
