[Intro]
It's Vedo, baby (Rock me, baby... well ho you like it?)

[Verse 1]
I know that you don’t need me
It’s kinda sexy when I want it, but you tease me
And you don’t let ‘em get us outta your head
'Cause you know when I leave I’ll be back to your bed
'Cause girl we got a good thang
So I can let ‘em fuck this up ready for wedding rings
One of a kind, glad your mind such a blessin’
Future baby mama if you’re ready
You know that I would do it
So don't test me lookin’ sexy
You bring out the best me, they gon’ copy (ah-hoa)
Shawty, you’re the best I've ever had by far
So imma treat ‘cha betta than your last by far

[Chorus]
No matter what you do
Ain't nobody tell me shit ‘bout you
I really can't explain the things you do
But it makes me crazy over you (Crazy over you)
No matter what you do
All I think about is you
And if they got a problem with my boo
Then they got a problem with me too

[Verse 2]
I love your conversation
Your touch is motivation
Swim good dive in your ocean
Back stroke na-nahh
Couldn't see before, but now I'm woke na-nah
First class neva fly coach na-nah
Girl, you get the best, I don’t see the rest you know
Shawty, you’re the best I ever had thus far
So i'ma treat ‘cha betta than your last by far

[Chorus]
No matter what you do
Ain't nobody tell me shit ‘bout you
I really can't explain the things you do
But it makes me crazy over you (Crazy over you)
No matter what you do
All I think about is you
And if they got a problem with my boo
Then they got a problem with me too

[Bridge]
I love you, and I need you
And I love you, and I need you

[Chorus]
No matter what you do
Ain't nobody tell me shit ‘bout you (Tell me shit about you)
I really can't explain the things you do (Oh)
But it makes me crazy over you (Crazy over you)
No matter what you do (No matter what you do)
All I think about is you (All I think about is you)
And if they got a problem with my boo (They got a problem)
Then they got a problem with me too
Yeah, yeah…
