[Intro: Ann Marie]
If I got you, and you got me
Yeah yeah

[Chorus: Ann Marie & 
Vedo
]
If I got you, you got me, it don't matter what they say
They just wish that they could be the one that's chillin' at your place
It ain't perfect but it's worth it every second of the day
Fuck this drama, count these commas, and get high as outer space, yeah
They gon' hate but that's okay, got no worries, girl we straight
'Bout my baby I don't play, put any nigga in they place
It don't matter, we gon' fight, 
be my Bey
, I'll 
be your Jay
Fuck that drama, on my mama, I'll pay what I gotta pay for loyalty

[Verse 1: Ann Marie]
Boy be the one that I can call on
They sayin' that we ain't gon' make it, well let's prove 'em wrong
Don't entertain these other niggas, you're the one I want
You and this money is the only thing I'm focused on
You're the only one
That get this pussy drippin' like the month of May
If I got you baby then I know I'm straight
Remain honest and you know I do the same
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

If I got you, you got me, it don't matter what they say

They gon' hate but that's okay, got no worries, girl we straight
'Bout my baby I don't play, put any nigga in they place
It don't matter, we gon' fight, be my Bey, I'll be your Jay
Fuck that drama, on my mama, I'll pay what I gotta pay for loyalty

[Verse 2: Vedo]
I need someone that's not gon' change on me
Promise if shit get hard you'll be there through the rain for me
Someone to keep it real, and tell me how they feel
Give my all 'cause I know that you
Only get freaky for me, call and make sure that I eat, oh yeah
'Cause a nigga be busy sometimes, that shit be slippin' my mind, oh yeah
Make you better, get you wetter, girl you know
Girl I got you, I'm gon' always keep you close

Pick up when you call, yeah, you deserve it all, yeah
