[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Y'all know what this is!

[Verse 1: Usher]
My mind was changed, I'm glad you made it
Intoxicated, your vibe's amazing
Feel the love in the air, baby, you know (You know)
Ain't no rush, we've been at it, where the time go? (Oh, oh-oh)
You gon' end up showin' me now
'Cause I done had one too many drinks
And I know that you feel me the way I (I) been feelin' you
And it's cool, that you
You got a motive and I think I like it
I know all your insecurities
I hope that you're open, my body gives notice
And I want your energy, girl, gimme that (Girl, gimme that)

[Chorus: Usher]
Good lovin', no questions
Reach out and you'll touch me
Bad habits, don't judge me
Just don't waste my time
Good lovin', no questions, babe (Ooh)
Reach out and you'll touch me (Ooh)
Bad habits, don't judge me (Ooh)
Just don't waste my time

[Verse 2: Ella Mai]
Ooh, late night
Coffee in the morning, what a date night
Better play right
Don't be timid when you in it, better lay right (Yeah, yeah)
I know you wanna go there
I see it, stop frontin', come here
I know you can drive it, chauffeur
Anticipate your touch down (Down)
Put me down like right now (Now)
Let's be 
lovers and friends
, let's rendezvous
Boy, 
I got plans for you
 (Yeah)
'Cause I'm motivated, I'm yours for the taking
Look no further, I got what you need (Ha, ooh)
Baby, I'm open (Yeah), you got my attention
Undivided, oh, baby, come give me that

[Chorus: Usher, 
Ella Mai

Bad habits, don't judge me
Just don't waste my time

[Bridge: Usher,

Girl, it's about to go down (Ooh)
And I ain't here to play around (Ooh)
Ladies, if you're here with somebody
And you know you want their body
Go and let 'em hear you say it loud
Boy, it's about to go down
 (Ooh,

Hear what you're sayin', come and show me now

Fellas, if you with somebody
And you know you want their body
Then let me hear you say it loud

Reach out and you'll touch me (Ooh)
Bad habits,
