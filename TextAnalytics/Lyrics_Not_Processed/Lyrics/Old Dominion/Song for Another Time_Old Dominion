[Verse 1]
Right now we both know
We're Marina Del Ray
Planes gonna fly away
And you'll be on it
And by This Time Tomorrow
I'll be singing Yesterday
The sunshine's gonna fade
And we can't stop it
So before we turn in, I Can't Make You Love Me

[Chorus]
Let's be Brown Eyed Girl, Sweet Caroline
Freefallin' Small Town Saturday Night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go Dancing on the Ceiling
Keep on living that Teenage Dream
Paradise City, where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry
But that's a song for another time

[Verse 2]
Just for One More Day, What Do You Say?
Baby be my Pretty Woman
Because we know Sunday morning's coming down
Let's take a drive, you and I
Down some old country road
Talk about growing old in one of those Pink Houses
Yeah we might be a Candle in the Wind
But let's pretend we're

[Chorus]
Brown Eyed Girl sweet Caroline
Freefallin' small town Saturday night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go dancing on the ceiling
Keep on living that teenage dream
Paradise city where the grass is green
Pretty soon you'll be always on my mind
But that's a song for another time

[Bridge]
So before we're singing I will always love you

[Chorus]
Let's sing brown eyed girl sweet Caroline
Freefallin' small town Saturday night
Before you lose that loving feeling
Let's go dancing on the ceiling
Keep on living that teenage dream
Paradise city where the grass is green
Pretty soon I'll be so lonesome I could cry
But that's a song for another time

[Outro]
Yeah that's a song for another time
(Brown eyed girl sweet Caroline)
Yeah, that's a song for another time
(Freefallin' small town Saturday night)
That's a song for another time
