[Verse 1]
Well, it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words were "do not disturb"
Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in 'til three

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

[Verse 2]
Well, I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah

[Bridge]
We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but

[Chorus]
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

[Outro]
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key, ooh
She kept the hotel key
