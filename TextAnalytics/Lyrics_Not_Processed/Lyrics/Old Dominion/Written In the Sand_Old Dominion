[Verse 1]
Turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend
And you won’t say the words that I want but you flirt when you’re drinkin’
I see those bubbles pop up like you’re texting then they disappear
Lets cut through the shit then let’s get to what we’re doing here

[Chorus]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause i’m tired of asking myself

[Chorus]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand
Are we last call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen, baby tell me what it is or what it isn't
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand

[Outro]
Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number I should wash right off my hand
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand
