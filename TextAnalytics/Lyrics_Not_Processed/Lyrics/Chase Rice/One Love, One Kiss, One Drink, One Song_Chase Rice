[Verse 1]
You know, I really thought I was moving on
'Til that George Strait song came on
Goin' on about his ex from Texas
Guess with me, that's a memory, yeah, I don't mess
Well, 'til the king brought you up in the speakers of this truck
Now you're stuck here in my mind

[Chorus]
Everybody got that one love, that one kiss
Keep thinking 'bout what you're gonna miss (You're gonna miss)
As soon as they go
Everybody got that one drink, that one song
Drowns you out, takes you along (Takes you along)
Down memory road
I drive my Chevy, crank the music
Roll to her place, no, don't do it
Okay, go in, here we go again
Just how it goes when that's what you know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you know

[Verse 2]
What you know, I hit Tin Roof
And sure I know it's just plain bad news
J Griff serves my old go-to
And like clockwork, incoming call from you, yeah

[Chorus]
Everybody got that one love, that one kiss
Keep thinking 'bout what you're gonna miss (You're gonna miss)
As soon as they go
Everybody got that one drink, that one song
Drowns you out, takes you along (Takes you along)
Down memory road
I drive my Chevy, crank the music
Roll to her place, no, don't do it
Okay, go in, here we go again
Just how it goes when that's what you know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you know

[Bridge]
My truck, my keys, third time this week
My low beams down that same old street
One love, one kiss, one drink, one song
I think of you, one sip, I'm gone

[Chorus]
Yeah, everybody got that one love, that one kiss
Keep thinking 'bout what you're gonna miss
As soon as they go
Everybody got that one drink, that one song
Drowns you out, takes you along
Down memory road
I drive my Chevy, crank the music
Roll to her place, no, don't do it
Okay, go in, here we go again
Just how it goes when that's what you know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you know
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you know

[Bridge]
My truck, my keys, third time this week
My low beams down that same old street
One love, one kiss, one drink, one song
I think of you, one sip, I'm gone, yeah

[Outro]
You know, I really thought I was moving on
'Til that George Strait song came on
