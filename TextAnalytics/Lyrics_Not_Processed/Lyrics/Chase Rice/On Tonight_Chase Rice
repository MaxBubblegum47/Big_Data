[Verse 1]
Little red dress hanging on a hanger
You only wear it when you're feeling dangerous
Hope you slip it on slow in the mirror
And it makes you want to drink too much
When you can't unzip yourself, so you ask for a little help
Through a red wine, kiss-me smile
I hope it's on tonight

[Chorus]
I hope 1:15 rolls around
And you need me, like I need you right now
I don't care, what we said
If I'm on your mind, it ain't over, not yet
Yeah, you and me are kinda like that blinking caution light
We've been on again and off again so many times
I hope it's on tonight
I hope it's on tonight

[Verse 2]
Hope you're in the back of a yellow cab
And a song comes on from way back when
When it flips that switch inside you
Makes you wanna pull me in
And when you sing right up the stairs
While you're taking down your hair
And it sets the room on fire
I hope it's on tonight

[Chorus]
And I hope 1:15 rolls around
And you need me, like I need you right now
I don't care, what we said
If I'm on your mind, it ain't over, not yet
Yeah, you and me are kinda like that blinking caution light
We've been on again and off again so many times
I hope it's on tonight
I hope it's on tonight

[Bridge]
I hope your head is on your phone
And you don't wanna be alone
I really don't wanna be alone

[Chorus]
If 1:15 rolls around
And you need me, like I need you right now
Yeah, I don't care, what we said
If I'm on your mind, it ain't over, not yet
Yeah, you and me are kinda like that blinking caution light
We've been on again and off again so many times
I hope it's on tonight
I hope it's on tonight
