[Verse 1]
There's a Tennessee two-lane sky
Shakes the Broadway bars at night
Makes you wanna get a little too close
To a Cali girl watchin' windshield satellites
It's a soundtrack to our lives
It's the only reason why
A kid from Carolina would drive to Nashville
To chase a dream without a dime

[Chorus 1]
It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand in the neon lights
Sweet Home Alabama
 and a 
Ring of Fire
I could sing along 'til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in the bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one
And she whispers, "Turn it up"

[Post-Chorus]
And for a second, we're bulletproof
We get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
And three chords and the truth

[Verse 2]
I see you blinkin' through your blue eyes
How a song can turn back time
You can almost feel the sand on your feet
From the passenger seat
Singing anything but mine
And don't you know that we were raised on the radio?

[Chorus 2]
It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand in the neon lights
Copperhead Road and
 
Mama tried
I could sing along 'til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in the bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one
And she whispers, "Turn it up"

[Post-Chorus]
And for a second, we're bulletproof
We get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
And three chords and the truth

[Bridge]
It's Muscle Shoals to rock n' roll
It's a steel guitar that steals your soul
It's a country song that takes you home again

[Chorus 3]
It's why we drink too much on Friday nights
Raise our hand in church pew aisles
Amazing Grace, Sweet By and By
I could sing along 'til the day I die
Why we break up, fall back in love
Why we roll around in the bed of a truck
Why we all stop when we hear that one
And she whispers, "Turn it up"

[Post-Chorus]
And for a second we're bulletproof
Get lost in a song or two
The world don't move, and all I need is you
And three chords and the truth
