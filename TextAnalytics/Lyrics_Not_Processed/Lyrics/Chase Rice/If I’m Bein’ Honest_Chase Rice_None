[Verse 1]
I don’t stay up late in the middle of the night
Drink from a bottle, half empty as me
I don’t cruise down Villa Place sometimes
Wonder why your car ain’t parked in the street
No way not me I'm way too tough
I ain’t tore up with what went down with us

[Chorus 1]
But if I'm being honest, baby, I'm still crazy about you
I fucked things up and now I’m man enough to finally face that truth
Since I'm being honest, baby, I got no clue what to do
So I stay drunk and high all the time to get me over you
If I'm being honest, if I'm being honest

[Verse 2]
My mom don't call to check on me
Cause she knows I'm good, yeah, doin’ just fine
And when I see my friends on Demonbreun street
I'm all calm and cool and having a hell of a time
I ain't masquerading your memory
No way no how, no that ain’t me

[Chorus 1]
But if I'm being honest, baby, I'm still crazy about you
I fucked things up and now i’m man enough to finally face that truth
Since I'm being honest, baby, i got no clue what to do
So i stay drink and high all the time to get me over you
If I'm being honest, if I'm being honest

[Bridge]
I don’t talk to god each night and pray, to him that you’re ok
And Come to think, I don’t think of you at all and wonder where you are today

[Chorus 2]
But if I'm being honest, baby, I'm still crazy about you
I fucked things up and now I’m man enough to finally face that truth
Since I'm being honest, baby, i got no clue what to do
So I string four cords and the truth, and rhymes and hope it reaches you
If I'm being honest, if I'm being honest
