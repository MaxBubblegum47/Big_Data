[Verse 1]
It's the sheets wrinkled up at the foot of the bed
It's your hair in a knot on the top of your head
It's the crawlin' in the backseat, knockin' over everything
'Cause we couldn't wait to get home
Baby, lovin' you, it ain't always pretty
But as long as you let me
I'll take the messy, oh

[Verse 2]
It's the mascara running away from those hold me eyes
And you don't know why you cried, but I'm still gonna hold you tight
It's the cabernet spilling, and all of those feelings we’ve been bottling up
Baby, lovin' you, it ain't always pretty
But as long as you let me

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you the best that I can
Even when you can't stand me
Even when you can't even stand yourself
I'm telling you I ain't going nowhere
I swear, don't care, I'm here, ain't anywhere else I'd rather be
And as long as you let me
I'll take the messy, oh

[Verse 3]
It's the way that I need to learn to hold my tongue
And you give it right back, but we never give up
It's the taking a breather, but nobody's leaving
You better believe it, baby, I mean it

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you the best that I can
Even when you can't stand me
Even when you can't even stand yourself
I'm telling you I ain't going nowhere
I swear, don't care, I'm here, ain't anywhere else I'd rather be
And as long as you let me
I'll take the heavy, unsteady
It don't scare me, baby, I'm ready for messy, oh

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you the best that I can
Even when you can't stand me
Even when you can't even stand yourself
I'm telling you I ain't going nowhere
I swear, don't care, I'm here, ain't anywhere else I'd rather be
And as long as you let me
I'll take the messy, oh
