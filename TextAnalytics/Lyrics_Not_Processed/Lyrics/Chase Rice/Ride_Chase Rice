[Intro]
Oh oh oh
Woah woah woah yeah
Oh oh oh yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Take off those heels, lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pulling on your hair
Poison in our veins but we don't even care
Candles dripping on your body, baby this ain't truth or dare

Everybody wonders where we run off to
My body on your body baby sticking like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty girl, it's only one or two
The fever's fucking running, feel the heat between us too

[Chorus]
I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride
I'm gon ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me

I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride, I'm gon ride
I'm gon ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet

Yeah girl, we can go slow
Yeah, we can go slow

[Verse 2]
Lay on your back, like you right there
Don't have to say it twice, love, there's nothing here to fear
Taking it back, back to where it's clear
Rolling on and on, sounds of loving in the air

[Chorus]
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon' make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet

[Bridge]
The sun's coming up, you're on my side
I rub your thigh, you look in my eyes
And I just see the sky, I'm so high
And I ain't smoked yet, I'm just coming down from it

[Chorus]
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'ma take care of your body, I'll be gentle, don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me

I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride on you baby, on you lady all night, all night
I'm gon make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet
