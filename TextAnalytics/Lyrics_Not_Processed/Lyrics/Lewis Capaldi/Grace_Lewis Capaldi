[Intro]
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes

[Verse 1]
I can't seem to drown you out long enough
I fell victim to the sound of your love
You're like a song that I ain't ready to stop
I got nothing but you on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste
Till I found salvation in the form of your...

[Chorus]
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away

[Verse 2]
On the verge of almost bleeding you out
Are we too wounded now to ever come down?
Oh, how I long for us to find common ground
I got nothing but you on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste
Till I found salvation in the form of your...

[Chorus]
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it, take it

[Bridge]
Way too close to colour your comfort
All dressed up, but kept undercover
Way too close to colour your comfort
All dressed up, but kept undercover

[Chorus]
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste
Till I found salvation in the form of your...

[Chorus]
Your grace (Your grace)
Your grace (Your grace)
Your grace (Your grace)
Don't take it away
Your grace (Your grace)
Your grace (Your grace)
Your grace
Don't take it away
