I don't mind, if you won't be around
I'm no longer broken, wish you could see me now
You know i don't mind, if you won't be around
Cause I've already started dreaming on my own again
And i try so hard to forget you
But somehow i know i will never have enough
And i try so hard not to see you
So now there is only one thing left for me to do
I've got to find another you
I've got to find another you
I don't mind, if you won't be around
I'm no longer broken, wish you could see me now
And i try so hard to forget you
But somehow i know i will never have enough
And i try so hard not to see you
So now there is only one thing for me left to do
I've got to find another you
I've got to find another you
I've got to find
I've got to find
I've got to find another you
I've got to find another you
I've got to find another you
I've got to find another you
