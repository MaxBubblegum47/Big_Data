I got myself together
And no, you ain't no friend of mine
There’ll be no more tears for you now
You see, I’m moving on fast
Finally got the pass
Gonna leave this pain behind
You cut deep, babe, but you don't see
You don't care, you don't bleed
You blow my mind like dynamite
You go boom, boom, boom

You cut deep, and now I know
Sweet, sweet words were all for show
The fuse is set, the dynamite
It goes boom boom
Boom, Boom, Boom (8x)

There will be no more retribution, no
So you better no waste your time
I don't miss your arms around me
You know I put my hands in the fire
When it burns me once
I don't need it for a second time

You cut deep, but you don't see
You don't care, you don't bleed
You blow my mind like dynamite
You go boom, boom, boom

You cut deep, and now I know
Sweet sweet words were all for show
The fuse is set, the dynamite
It goes boom, boom
Boom, Boom, Boom (8x)

I wish we ironed out the creases
Way before we ran out of steam
And I don't want to sound defeated
But if you still don't get it
You'll never gonna get it
How could you be a friend of mine?

You cut deep, but you don't see
You don't care, and you don't bleed
You blow my mind like dynamite
You go boom, boom, boom

You cut deep, and now I know
Sweet sweet words were all for show
The fuse is set, the dynamite
It goes boom, boom
Boom, Boom, Boom(8x)

You cut deep, but you don't see
You don't care, and you don't bleed
You blow my mind like dynamite
You go boom, boom, boom

You cut deep, and now I know
Sweet sweet words were all for show
The fuse is set, the dynamite
It goes boom, boom
