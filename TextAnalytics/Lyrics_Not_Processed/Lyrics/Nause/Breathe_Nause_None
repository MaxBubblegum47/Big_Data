[Verse 1]
Won't you, won't you sleep with me tonight?
Come and, come and love me for a while
I need more than conversation
I feel my body's running out of patience

Tell me, tell me I'm the one you want
Hold me, hold me close and keep me warm
'Cause you've been gone and I've been waiting
And lately it's been harder to be patient

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I could lose my mind
[Driving?] for your touch
Lose my psycho [vibe?]
Gasping for your love

[Chorus]
I need you to breathe
Breathe me in and out
Now baby, won't you breathe?
Make me come alive

I need you to breathe
Breathe me in and out
Now baby, won't you breathe?
Make me come alive

[Verse 2]
Feel my, feel my lust for your perfume
Tell the, tell the lie or tell the truth
'Cause even though my heart is aching
You're the only medicine I'm taking

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I could lose my mind
[Driving?] for your touch
Lose my psycho [vibe?]
Gasping for your love

[Chorus]
I need you to breathe
Breathe me in and out
Now baby, won't you breathe-breathe?
(Breathe me in and out)
Make me come alive

[Chorus]
I need you to breathe
Breathe me in and out
Now baby, won't you breathe-breathe?
Make me come alive

[Outro]
So put your fingers on my skin
Make me shiver, make me sin
Won't you give me everything [?]

I need you to breathe
Breathe me in
Breathe me in and out
