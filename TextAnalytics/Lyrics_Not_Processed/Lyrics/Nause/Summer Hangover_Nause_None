[Verse 1]
Wanna tell me how your summer has been
We haven't really talked about it
I really haven't asked about it
I did just fine without it
Won't tell you all the places I've seen
Feel kinda bad about it
Nothing I regret about it
Try to dig deep, but I won't allow it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
How, can I feel like I did yesterday?
When the sun's away
Our love, wasn't strong enough to stand the rain
Who's to blame?

[Chorus]
(How, how?)
Worry it'll be over
(How, how?)
Summer hangover
(How, how?)
Don't worry, it'll be over
(How, how?)

In the end we had nothing to gain
Let's not fight about it
Now's the time to drop it
Try to live without it

No time to be waiting
We waiting for tears or laughter
Then just close the chapter
I hear the songs out there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
How, can I feel like I did yesterday?
When the sun's away
Friday, thirsty for another love
One not enough

[Chorus]
(How, how?)
Don't worry, it'll be over
(How, how?)
Summer hangover
(How, how?)
Don't worry, it'll be over
(How, how?)
Summer hangover
Don't worry, it'll be over
(How, how?)

[Bridge]
Don't worry, it'll be over
This chilly October
No body showed up
Don't wait for your summer
It's just getting harder
Harder and brigher

[Chorus]
(How, how?)
Don't worry, it'll be over
(How, how?)
Summer hangover
(How, how?)
Don't worry, it'll be over
(How, how?)
Summer hangover
Don't worry, it'll be over
(How, how?)
