[Verse 1]
Aqualung, we were young
Dancing through the water
Like we could turn the tide
Just you and I
We always survive
Crashing into eachother
Like when two waves collide

[Chorus 1]
Well please don't let me drown
Suffocating water
Deep water, deep water
And if you drag me down
Aqualung breathe harder
Breathe harder, breathe harder

[Post-Chorus]
Aqualung

[Verse 2]
Put the anchor down
Deeper under ground
Lost in endless ocean
Where no one can be found
Drifting out in the blank
Floating on her back
We ignore the warning, no red flag

[Chorus 2]
Well please don't let me drown
Suffocating water
Deep water, deep water
And if you drag me down
Aqualung breathe harder
Breathe harder, breathe harder
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life
Please don't let me drown
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life
Please don't drag me down
Further and further and further we go
Deeper and deeper, we're lost in the storm
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life
Aqualung

[Bridge]
Gotta, gotta, gotta swim for my life, swim for my life
Yes, I gotta swim for my life, swim for my life
I'm gonna swim for my life, swim for my life
Gotta, gotta, gotta swim for my life, swim for my life
Yes, I gotta swim for my life, swim for my life
I'm gonna swim for my life, swim for my life
Gotta, gotta, gotta swim for my life, swim for my life
Yes, I gotta swim for my life, swim for my life
I'm gonna swim for my life, swim for my life

[Chorus 3]
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life
Please don't let me drown
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life
Aqualung, aqualung
Please don't drag me down
Please don't drag me down
Aqualung
Gonna swim for my life
Gonna swim for my life
Please don't let me drown

[Outro]
Gonna swim for my life
