[Verse 1]
I know I messed it up with every other guy
I swear you're different and this time I'm gonna try
We can start fresh if you'd just let go of the past yeah
I don't I don't I don't get it cause I don't judge you like that
Can't just love me in pieces gotta love it all
You try to make me feel like being humans wrong
You got a lot to say about me and my past
Well I don't, I don't, I don't get it cause I don't judge you like that

[Chorus]
Got me runnin' other places in my mind in my mind
How could you even say I never try never try
And you're acting like I been around with every single guy
Got me running other places in my mind in my mind yeah
Da da da da da da da da da da yeah
You're acting like I been around with every single guy got me running other places in my mind in my mind, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know that I could be with any other man
But none of them can do it quite the way you can
Thought we were stronger why you doubting all the time
Well I don't, I don't, I don't get it cause I'm so sweet all the time
Our love is effortless, stop acting like you're scared
I get down on my knees but you're not playing fair
My heart breaks down when you question if you're mine
When I don't, I don't, I don't get it
Cause I'm so sweet all the time

[Chorus]
Got me running other places in my mind, in my mind
How could you even say I never tried, never tried
And you acting like I been around with every single guy
Got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam, yeah
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam
And you acting like I been around with every single guy
You got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah

[Bridge]
Got me running to places where no body else has gone
And I tried to take you with me baby then it went all wrong
And I said, "I'm here to stay but I need to get away"
So I'm running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah

[Outro]
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam, yeah
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam (Ooh yeah)
And you acting like I been around with every single guy
You got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam
And you acting like I been around with every single guy
You got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah
