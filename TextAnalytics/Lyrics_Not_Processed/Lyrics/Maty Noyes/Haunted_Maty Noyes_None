Love, you left me haunted
Love, I’m just a shadow now

Dark in the night
Dark in the day
The messages won't go away

Love, you left me madness
Turn me (in)to a monster now

(Let the light in)

Love, I think I’m dying
Love, the monster’s got me now
Love, I think I’m dying
Love, the shadow's all around

Lost in years
Lost in the days
Lost, and it just won’t go away

Let the light in
Let the light in

Love, I feel you near me
Love is no more shadow now

Love, I feel you near me
Love is no more monster now
