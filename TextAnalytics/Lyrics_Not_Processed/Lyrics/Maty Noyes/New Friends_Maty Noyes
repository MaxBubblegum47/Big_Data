[Verse 1]
Naked pictures of your ex
Man, I didn't need to see that shit
Now I'm thinking about y'all having sex
Maybe you should keep it to yourself
You can't come over when you please
Just because you have a key
You sit around my house and smoke
No wonder your ass is always broke

[Pre-Chorus]
And my best friend just got a boyfriend
And I don't hear from her anymore
And my other best friend just got a girlfriend
I don't hear from him anymore

[Chorus]
Ooh, ah, we never get along
I think, 
I think Drake got it all wrong
Ooh, ah, I call you out again
I think, I think I need some new friends
New friends, new friends, yeah
I think, I think I need some new friends
New friends, new friends, hey
I think, I think I need some new friends

[Verse 2]
If you can't pay for your Uber here
Then I might never see you, dear
Spent it all up at the bar
Should have put the gas up in your car

[Pre-Chorus]
And my best friend just got a boyfriend
And I don't hear from her anymore
And my other best friend just got a girlfriend
Man, fuck this shit

[Chorus]
Ooh, ah, we never get along
I think, I think Drake got it all wrong
Ooh, ah, I call you out again
I think, I think I need some new friends
New friends, new friends, yeah
I think, I think I need some new friends
New friends, new friends, hey
I think, I think I need some new friends

[Bridge]
You need to help with the rent, the groceries, I would assume
You could take out the dog, I would do it for you
And if you pause to think about it, know I got a life, too
Y'all just don't respect me like I respect you
And why'd you hit my boyfriend up on Instagram
Letting him know that you know he got a nice dick
(What the fuck?)
I can forgive but I won't forget
Baby I give but I never get
Man, you really need to stop this shit
Damn, I'm really over it

[Chorus]
Ooh, ah, we never get along
I think, I think Drake got it all wrong
Ooh, ah, I call you out again
I think, I think I need some new friends
New friends, new friends, hey
I think, I think I need some new friends
New friends, new friends, yeah
I think, I think I need some new friends
New friends, new friends, hey
I think, I think I need some new friends
