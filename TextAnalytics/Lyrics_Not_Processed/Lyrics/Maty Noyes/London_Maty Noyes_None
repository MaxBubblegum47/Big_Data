[Intro]
Now you know
I'm not scared
Cause I don't need you, need you, need you, need you there

[Chorus]
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London

[Verse 1]
The fear escaped my bones when I
Told you I wasn't coming home, yeah
Thought I should let you know like an adult
And the airplanes said they wanna get high
With me up in the sky
And oh please tell me who am I to deny them?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Explosions and there is no controlling the emotions, whoa

[Chorus]
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London

[Verse 2]
I've got a brand new style
This world hasn't seen in a while, yeah
We all have our time now it's mine (dun dun dun)
I'll go round this world I claim
'Til it knows me by my first name, yeah
I've got my own life and baby it's calling

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Explosion, oh you're gonna feel it in my motions, whoa

[Chorus]
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London

[Bridge]
And when you start to miss my voice
Turn on the radio
And all you'll hear is Noyes
We all wanna change the world
I got a choice and baby I'm trying
And I will wait another day
Just to hear you have to say
I'm not going
Finally living like I should
It feels so good to be the queen of diamonds

[Chorus]
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
Mon to the munk and tree to the trunk and I'm gonna go to London
