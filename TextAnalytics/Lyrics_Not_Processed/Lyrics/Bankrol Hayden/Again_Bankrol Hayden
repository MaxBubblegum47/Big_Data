[Intro]
Ooh, J Mak

[Chorus]
When my niggas slide, you know they hide the evidence
'Cause we don't wanna go through it again
Baby girl, nah, I ain't lyin', I tell you she's just a friend
Nah, nah, I don't wanna go through this again
When we hoppin' out the [?] straight to [?]
Nah, we don't wanna go through this again
And my niggas, take care of them, ain't got no time to make new friends
Nah, nah, we don't wanna go through it again

[Verse 1]
Cut that shit talk (Talk), cut that shit talk
Me and my niggas, they drip-walk (Walk),  my niggas, they drip-walk, baby
Baby, I'm gettin' cheddar, all of the bands, I don't got time to make new friends
I'm on the road, they watchin' my friends, me and Eddie want big M's
Get her off of mе, off of me, she keep callin' me, callin' mе
She lets her [?] me, I got a fifth, keep on barkin', G
I got a money fetish (Fetish), I love the green lettuce (Lettuce)
Look at my team steppin' (Steppin'), we got the whole city reppin', God

[Chorus]
When my niggas slide, you know they hide the evidence
'Cause we don't wanna go through it again
Baby girl, nah, I ain't lyin', I tell you she's just a friend
Nah, nah, I don't wanna go through this again
When we hoppin' out the [?] straight to [?]
Nah, we don't wanna go through this again
And my niggas, take care of them, ain't got no time to make new friends
Nah, nah, we don't wanna go through it again (Look, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I paid ten thousand for my fit, this shit get sticky on 'em
I stay one thousand to myself, I can't depend upon 'em
Diamonds froze like ice age, my links got blizzards on 'em
I heard they lookin' for me, no, they ain't got that Glizzy on 'em
Hop out a Benz and I'm with three hoes in the Range Rove'
Got a bad bitch from out the way in Louis V raincoats
Better use your mind up in these streets, sit back, lay low
I'm in the 6 for the night, I'm posted where you can't go

[Chorus]
When my niggas slide, you know they hide the evidence
'Cause we don't wanna go through it again
Baby girl, nah, I ain't lyin', I tell you she's just a friend
Nah, nah, I don't wanna go through this again
When we hoppin' out the [?] straight to [?]
Nah, we don't wanna go through this again
And my niggas, take care of them, ain't got no time to make new friends
Nah, nah, we don't wanna go through it again

[Verse 3]
She said she don't wanna go through it again
But when she with my nigga, she never want it to end
They kickin' strong, they kickin' like Jackie Chan
And you birds ain't gettin' no bread, you just chirpin' up out your hand
Mama told me keep your pen 'cause they can snake you in the end
There's a party up at my pen, girl, you can bring one of your friends
We been ballin' since [?], we get up higher up than the rim
All of my niggas, they get it in, yeah, my niggas, they get it in

[Chorus]
When my niggas slide, you know they hide the evidence
'Cause we don't wanna go through it again
Baby girl, nah, I ain't lyin', I tell you she's just a friend
Nah, nah, I don't wanna go through this again
When we hoppin' out the [?] straight to [?]
Nah, we don't wanna go through this again
And my niggas, take care of them, ain't got no time to make new friends
Nah, nah, we don't wanna go through it again
