[Verse 1: Bankrol Hayden]
Look, look
I’m just looking for a female I can vibe wit' on the daily
Bust a couple bands, make it out and have a baby
See these haters gonna hate but hell nah they ain’t phase me
You can do some wrong shit, I'ma still love you crazy
I'ma love you regardless, I ain’t gon’ ever do you shady
Without a doubt you gon’ be my lucky lady
Ayy, ayy, you gon' be my lucky lady you gon' be my lucky lady
Look, I'ma ride for ya, die for ya
Never switch sides on you
Why would I lie if I was giving all this time to you?
You gon’ have to use your mind boo
Shit, if you tryna cut it’s fine too
No new friends but she new to the crew
Shawty try to play me I'ma have to let her loose
Draw to much for one now you out here tryna choose
Silly hoes say I’m cheatin' but there ain’t no fucking proof
Cops they saw me nigga, why you fucking with them goose?
You won’t ever see me lyin' I'ma always tell the truth
And if you do me dirty I'ma pass her to the crew
Ayy, I'ma pass her to the crew

[Chorus: Cal]
I need a girl on her ten toes, yeah she gotta ride for me
Someone I know that’s really gonna slide
If I do time she’ll be right there when every thought get's you free
I know that she would be by my side

[Verse 2: Bankrol Hayden]
I'ma ride for you, die for you, never switch sides on you
Why would I lie if I was giving all this time to you
You gon’ have to use your mind boo
Shit, if your tryna cut it’s fine too

[Verse 3: Cal]
I’m not the nigga they say I am
See they be talking shit, see they try to slither in your lane
But I’m just being who I am
And that’s why niggas steady hate
Couldn't get up on my game ahh
I’m just about to make it happen, win some, lose some
I’m about the action, but you are my attraction
And I’m not actin'
This is as real as it get's no talk out the neck
I’m with your with them, forgive not forget
It doesn’t only
Us so don’t you trip off not bitches I’m on it

[Refrain: Bankrol Hayden]
And you don’t need to rock that makeup, grown
Forever together we can get that cake up
Stay real and we don’t ever have to breakup
And we don’t ever have to breakup

[Bridge: Cal]
And we don’t ever have to break up
And we don’t ever have to
Break up ahh

[Chorus: Cal]
I need a girl on her ten toes, yeah she gotta ride for me
Someone I know that’s really gonna slide
If I do time she’ll be right there when every thought get's you free
I know that she would be by my side
