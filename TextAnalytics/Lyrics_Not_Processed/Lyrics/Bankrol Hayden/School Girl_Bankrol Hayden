[Chorus]
Love just what it do, girl
In love just with a school girl
But I ride with twenty-two's, girl
With you was deja vu, girl
A model, I don't play with you, girl
In love just with a school girl

[Verse]
Fool me once and fool me twice
You fuck with my whole world
Shame on me and blame on me
But baby you my girl
Love for my brothers, plus my motherfuckin' sisters
Bitch I'm eighteen and I made seven fuckin' figures
Why you so in denial, in denial?
Hold me close, yeah 'til tomorrow
It's me, it's never you
I say, "Lil' baby, a throwback"
Lean in and kiss you, your lips chapped
You do your games and I play that
Without you my world is pitch black

[Bridge]
Hoes ain't fold like clothes
How she move, it shows
Hoes ain't fold like clothes
How she move, it shows
Yeah

[Chorus]
Love just what it do, girl
In love just with a school girl
But I ride with twenty-two's, girl
With you was déjà vu, girl
A model, I don't play with you, girl
In love just with a school girl
