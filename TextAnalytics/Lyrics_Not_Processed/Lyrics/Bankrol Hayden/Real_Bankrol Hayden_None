[Verse 1]
They switched up, something like a switchblade
Real situations poppin' off, they turning bitch made
Fuck the broke shit, I want a big house and big maze, let's get paid
How you claim you Bankrol but you diss gang?
By any means, regardless I gotta do it
Yeah my life was on the line, almost died, [?] almost lose it
No Juice WRLD shit but my dreams, they feeling lucid
Gotta move it, a dream on mind, I gotta prove it like
My inspiration to the youth and yeah they feel that
Scars on my body, when you see them you can feel that
Free Big Bricks, she had the packs, she concealed it yeah
It's love for Dave and DN, yeah they got me, they gon' peel back
Peel back, something like bananas
We been getting to the bag, they hating and they can't stand us
Broke ass back, it got me walking like a grandpa
Got a bag full of goodies, it got me looking like I'm Santa
Yeah, ayy, go get your act right
Tell them little hoes they better go'n get they act right
Car crash happened, G-O-D that was a sad night
It made me who I am, but socially I'm turning anti

[Chorus]
This for the real, so fuck just how you feel
I was taught to stay consistent and one day we'll touch a mil
Remember popping them pills, recording up [?] feel
Bands on medical bills, forgetting just how them feel like
And y'all ain't never felt my pain
Got me pouring out my feelings when I'm walking through the rain
Reminiscing 'bout them days I was going through some things
Got me six feet down, I almost died up in that grave

[Verse 2]
But I'm still standing here today
Stayed down for the come up, I know my future finna pay
I'm talking each and every day, and I been eating shrimp and steak
Nothing to something, I'm planning moving to LA

[Chorus]
This for the real, so fuck just how you feel
I was taught to stay consistent and one day we'll touch a mil
Remember popping them pills, recording up [?] feel
Bands on medical bills, forgetting just how them feel like
And y'all ain't never felt my pain
Got me pouring out my feelings when I'm walking through the rain
Reminiscing 'bout them days I was going through some things
Got me six feet down, I almost died up in that grave
