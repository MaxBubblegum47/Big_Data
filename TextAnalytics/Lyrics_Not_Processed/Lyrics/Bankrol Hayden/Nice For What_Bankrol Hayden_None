[Verse]
Ayy, look
Without no money would you still love me?
Without my password would you still trust me?
We really rich as fuck on these haters
We gotta get rich as fuck and count this paper
I know we is
I know you hate me for all the of things that I fucking did
I'm truly sorry for all of the things that I fucking did
I know you hurting in pain and you can't trust shit
But fuck the drugs ride for me I'll be your substance
Ayy, yuh
'Cause you a bad thing
Class of 2020 together we get a class ring
I was broke barely had shit, I never had things
Let's take a trip to the top and touch a bag bae
Let's give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout
Girl they only hating on us 'cause we poppin' now
'Cause we poppin' now
Girl they only hating on us 'cause we poppin' now
