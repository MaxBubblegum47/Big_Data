[Verse 1]
Long nights with you
When the worst gets said
But it ends in bed and bad attitude
I overreact but you throw it back and

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's so hard to understand
We both wanna stop it but we can't

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'mma give you all my blood, sweat, tears (ah-ooh!)
And when it hurts I'm gonna stay right here (ah-ooh!)
Throw my heart out on the pavement, cut it up and take it
I just wanna die with you
So baby you can take my blood, sweat, tears (ah-ooh!)

[Verse 2]
Don't go away, we can take a ride
We can take some time, yeah
Some people fade
And I don't know why I can't say goodbye, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's so hard to understand
Oh, we both wanna stop it but we can't

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'mma give you all my blood, sweat, tears (ah-ooh!)
And when it hurts I'm gonna stay right here (ah-ooh!)
Throw my heart out on the pavement, cut it up and take it
I just wanna die with you
So baby you can take my blood, sweat, tears (ah-ooh!)

[Hook]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Yeah, I'mma give you all my blood, sweat, tears, ohh

[Chorus]
Yeah, Imma give you all my blood, sweat, tears (ah-ooh!)
And when it hurts I'm gonna stay right here (ah-ooh!)
Throw my heart out on the pavement, cut it up and take it
I just wanna die with you
So baby you can take my blood, sweat, tears (ah-ooh!)

[Outro]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
