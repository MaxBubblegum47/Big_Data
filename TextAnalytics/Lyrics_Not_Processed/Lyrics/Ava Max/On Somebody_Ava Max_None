[Verse 1]
Heartbreak, heartbreak is a motherfucker
I know, I know but I found a way to
Deal though, deal though, it took work to get the wheels are moving on, wheels are moving on
Can't stay, can't stay on a used lover
I know, I've been better off without it
You though, you thought it took work to get these feelings turning off, feelings turning off

[Chorus]
Oh, my, my, my, my, my
I see you moving side to side, side, side, side, side
Two hands on you that aren't mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
You never know how much you're on somebody 'til they're on somebody else
So my, my, my, my, my
I wish my eyes knew how to lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
And tell my body I'll be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You never know how much you're on somebody 'til they're on somebody else

[Verse 2]
Heartbreak, heartbreak is a motherfucker
Lay low, lay low, that's how they tell you to
Let go, letting go went out the window
Soon as I saw you pull up from two

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the break of every wave crash into me (Crashing)
Wishing I went somewhere else and left you in my dreams

[Chorus]
Oh, my, my, my, my, my
I see you moving side to side, side, side, side, side
Two hands on you that aren't mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
You never know how much you're on somebody 'til they're on somebody else
So my, my, my, my, my
I wish my eyes knew how to lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
And tell my body I'll be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You never know how much you're on somebody 'til they're on somebody else

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the break of every wave crash into me
Wishing I went somewhere else and left you in my dreams (Haha)

[Chorus]
Oh, my, my, my, my, my
I see you moving side to side, side, side, side, side
Two hands on you that aren't mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
You never know how much you're on somebody 'til they're on somebody else
So my, my, my, my, my
I wish my eyes knew how to lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
And tell my body I'll be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You never know how much you're on somebody 'til they're on somebody else

[Outro]
Oh, when you're on somebody, when you're on somebody
(Oh, baby, on somebody else)
Oh, when you're on somebody, when you're on somebody
'Til they're on somebody else
