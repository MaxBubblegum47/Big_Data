[Intro]
I need you, I need you
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Boy, you're driving me crazy
You know that I’ve been missing you lately
And boy, you've got me losing my mind
You know I wanna be with you all the time
'Cause I need you, I need you
I’m going crazy without you
I need you, I want you
Boy, I can't get you out of my mind, oh

[Chorus]
When you gonna be with me, with me?
When you gonna kiss me, kiss me?
When you gonna touch me, touch me?
I'm so in love with you
Ever since I met you, met you
I've been tryna get through, get through (Get through)
‘Cause I wanna let you, let you into my life

[Verse 2]
Boy,there's something about you (Oh)
You really get under my skin (Oh, oh)
And now you're the addiction
I'm fighting and I just can't win
I need you (Oh, come on)
I need you
Every moment of every day
I need you, I want you
But there’s something I’ve got to say, (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
When you gonna be with me, with me?
When you gonna kiss me, kiss me?
When you gonna touch me, touch me?
I'm so in love with you
Ever since I met you, met you (Oh, met you)
I’ve been tryna get through, get through (Get through)
‘Cause I wanna let you, let you into my life

[Bridge]
Now I'm aware
I will find you
Always, I'll be thinking of you, oh

[Chorus]
When you gonna be with me, with me?
When you gonna kiss me, kiss me?
When you gonna touch me, touch me?
I'm so in love with you
Ever since I met you, met you (Since I met you)
I’ve been tryna get through, get through
‘Cause I wanna let you, let you into my life

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Come on
Oh, oh
I need you
I need you
I need you
Oh, oh, I want you
I need you
I want you
