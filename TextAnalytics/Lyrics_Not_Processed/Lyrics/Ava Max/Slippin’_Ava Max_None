[Verse 1: Ava Max]
You're not afraid to touch me
But you're afraid to love me
Why you scared?
'Cause baby, I'm right here
You should know you're lucky
That you can have some of me
Tell me why you scared
'Cause baby, I'm right here

[Pre-Chorus: Ava Max]
I'm not sayin' you're heartless
You're just using your heart a little less
I'm not trying to be obsessed
Just not ready to let you go yet

[Chorus: Ava Max]
You're slippin', slippin through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'
Slippin', slippin' through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'

[Verse 2: Ava Max]
Last week in the sauna
Yeah, we made our genre
But then you disappeared
Baby, I'm right here
If you want good karma
Why you causin' drama?
I smell your fear
Let's get one thing clear

[Pre-Chorus: Ava Max]
I'm not sayin' you're heartless
You're just using your heart a little less
I'm not trying to be obsessed
Just not ready to let you go yet

[Chorus: Ava Max]
You're slippin', slippin through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'
Slippin', slippin' through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'

[Verse 3: GASHI]
Slippin', fallin'
I'm tryna get up now
I never knew what love is
Show me that right now
You know I copped you the foreign
You know that I'm never boring
You the one that always ignorin'
I'm the one always that's callin'
I swear that they prayin' that we broke up
Put it on me like a coaster
Everyday we gettin' closer
Stuck to you just like a poster
Wearin' my heart over my sleeve
You got your head on my shoulder
You know that I'm never gon' leave
I'm in it till it's over

[Chorus: Ava Max]
You're slippin', slippin through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'
Slippin', slippin' through my fingers
And I'm grippin', grippin' on your body
Where do you think that you're goin'?
Ain't no one better you know it
Boy you're slippin', baby, you're slippin'
