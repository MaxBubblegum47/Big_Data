[Verse 1]
Forgive me for making you wait up for me
I'll pull you in like the waves of the sea
I promise
Yeah, I promise
It's hard to forget me, just wait and you'll see
I cannot help it, it comes naturally
If I'm honest
I'm never honest

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll be screaming out my name
Cursing me for getting oh so close
Didn't mean to cause no pain
But it's just out of my control, oh boy
And you're better off on your own
Uh, yeah

[Chorus]
Belladonna, belladonna, belladonna, belladonna
Poisonous, contagious, get you high in my cabana
Belladonna, belladonna, belladonna, belladonna
Dangerous, addictive, don't come here unless you wanna
Belladonna, belladonna
Belladonna

[Verse 2]
Uh, sweet like a flower at the beginning
But nothing is ever the way that it seems
But I like it
I can't deny it
Soon as I'm done, I just get up and leave
I swear I don't do it intentionally
I can't help it
A little selfish, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll be screaming out my name (Oh)
Cursing me for getting oh so close
Didn't mean to cause no pain (Oh)
But it's just out of my control, oh boy
And you're better off on your own

[Chorus]
Belladonna, belladonna, belladonna, belladonna (Yeah, oh, yes)
Poisonous, contagious, get you high in my cabana
Belladonna, belladonna, belladonna, belladonna (Oh, yes)
Dangerous, addictive, don't come here unless you wanna
Belladonna, belladonna
Belladonna

[Outro]
Oh (Let's go)
Oh
Ooh, ooh
Oh (Belladonna)
Oh (Belladonna)
(Belladonna)
