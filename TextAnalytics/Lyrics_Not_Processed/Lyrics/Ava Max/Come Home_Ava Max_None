[Verse 1]
I'm all alone, thinking in my head
Begin the words that I'd never say
Feels just like yesterday, you left my bed
You were the match and we were heaven sent

[Pre-Chorus]
Thought that I could catch myself from falling
Underneath the spell you put upon me
Now I see you every time I close my eyes
I close my eyes

[Chorus]
I tried it all but nothing, nothing compares
I miss your hands just running straight through my hair
I have no life without you giving me air
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home
I tried to fall again but it wasn't the same
I missed your heartbeat on me everyday
I'm a disaster pouring harder than rain
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home

[Verse 2]
You're going wild, gonna bring you close
I'm getting wild at my head at home
Where are you now? Yet, I never know
Come feels you spreading through my every bone

[Pre-Chorus]
Thought that I could catch myself from falling
Underneath the spell you put upon me
Now I see you every time I close my eyes
I close my eyes

[Chorus]
I tried it all but nothing, nothing compares
I miss your hands just running straight through my hair
I have no life without you giving me air
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home
I tried to fall again but it wasn't the same
I missed your heartbeat on me everyday
I'm a disaster pouring harder than rain
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home

[Bridge]
And no one can do what you do
Oh, no one can move like you move
I shouldn't have left like a fool
Oh, no one can do what you do

[Chorus]
I tried it all but nothing, nothing compares
I miss your hands just running straight through my hair
I have no life without you giving me air
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home
I tried to fall again but it wasn't the same
I missed your heartbeat on me everyday
I'm a disaster pouring harder than rain
Oh, baby come home, oh, baby come home

[Outro]
Cause no one can do like you do
So, come home
Cause no one can move like you move
