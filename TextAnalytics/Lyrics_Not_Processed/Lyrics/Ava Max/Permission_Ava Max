[Pre-Chorus: Ava Max]
Know you really like what I do, up and down in these shoes
Got you asking my daddy for permission
Say you really like what you see
Wanna get to know me
Oh, you know that you've got my permission
Give it to me now

[Chorus: Ava Max]
Ooh, oh-ah-ah
Oh, oh-ah-ah
Ooh, you got my permission
Ooh, oh-ah-ah
Oh, oh-ah-ah
Ooh, you got my permission

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Permission to touch, permission to kiss
I need permission to watch you dance, girl
Permission for that, permission for this
All you gotta do is take my hand, girl
And I can take you there, there
Just let me take you there, there
Somewhere where nobody could see how we do it
And I pull your hair, girl
Try not to be obvious, cause we kinda got an audience
All these girls up inside this club
And im feeling on you (Feeling on you)
Im tryna be a gentleman, but its hard with them jeans you in
Make sure you tell all your friens that im leaving with you
