[Intro: Ava Max]
(Tonight)

[Chorus: Ava Max]
I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I
If you let me, I’ll be
Out of my dress and into your arms tonight
Yeah, I'm lost without it
Feels like I'm always waitin’
I need you to come get me
Out of my head, and into your arms tonight
Tonight
(Tonight)
(Tonight)
I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I
If you let me, I'll be
Out of my head, and into your arms tonight
Tonight
(Tonight)

[Verse: Witt Lowry]
I don't mean to make you wait, just the pressure's been gettin' heavy
I know if I fuck us up, we'll be over, done, you'll forget me
Forget me, I’m feelin’ bad that I act this way, 'cause you let me
They call me king, but I know my queen will be there to check me
Last year, was runnin’ 'round 45th lookin' for SoHo
Last night, was ridin' down Rodeo lookin’ for no ho
It's crazy what can change in a year, think that you know though
Go back and forth like a yo-yo, they live their life for the photos, like

[Chorus: Ava Max]
I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I
If you let me, I'll be
Out of my dress and into your arms tonight
Yeah, I'm lost without it
Feels like I'm always waitin'
I need you to come get me
Out of my head, and into your arms tonight
Tonight
(Tonight)
I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I
If you let me, I'll be
Out of my head, and into your arms tonight
Tonight
