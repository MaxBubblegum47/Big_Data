[Intro]
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 1]
She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong
Let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying "No, no"
Then saying "Yes, yes, yes"
'Cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 2]
See, someone said, don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugar coat it

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong
Let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying "No (no, no, no), no (no)"
Then saying "Yes, yes, yes"
'Cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Bridge]
You're just like me, you're out your mind
I know it's strange, we're both the crazy kind
You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
