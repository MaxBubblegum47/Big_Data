[Verse 1]
Never did I ever
Mean to make a mess
How I'm gonna get home
Is anybody's guess
Money where your mouth was
Gonna wake up in debt
And my car ain't fixed yet
Oh, no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Crazy stupid love
Let the the beat do what it does
Let the music lift you up
Tonight we got enough
Crazy stupid love
Let the the beat do what it does
Let the music lift you up
Tonight we got enough

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, aah
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, aah

[Verse 2]
Never did I ever
Mean to send a text
Maybe in the morning
We can make amends
Keep on running my mouth
You keep getting obsessed
Baby, don't be upset

[Pre-Chorus]
Crazy stupid love
Let the the beat do what it does
Let the music lift you up
Tonight we got enough

[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, aah
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, aah
Ah-ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, aah

[Post-Chorus]
Crazy stupid love
Let the the beat do what it does
Let the music lift you up
Tonight we got enough
Crazy stupid love
Let the the beat do what it does
Let the music lift you up
Tonight we got enough
