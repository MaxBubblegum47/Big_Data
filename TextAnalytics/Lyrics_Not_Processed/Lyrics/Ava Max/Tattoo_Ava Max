[Verse 1]
The kind of lover that stays on your mind
See me wherever you go, yeah
You want forever after just a night
You'll never leave it alone, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
A permanent mark that won't fade away
Boy, you can't erase me

[Chorus]
I'm like a tattoo that's over your heart
'Cause once I put this love on you, it never comes off
I'm like a tattoo that's under your skin
So write my name in cursive 'cause you'll never forget
Ooh na-na, ooh na-na, ooh na-na (Ooh)
Ooh na-na, ooh na-na, ooh na-na (Ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
You want my kisses to start at your neck
Cover your body all over
Can't keep it hidden, I'm stuck in your head
But that don't mean that I'm yours, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
A permanent mark that won't fade away
Boy, you can't erase me, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm like a tattoo (Tattoo) that's over your heart (Your heart)
'Cause once I put this love on you, it never comes off
I'm like a tattoo (Tattoo) that's under your skin (Under your skin)
So write my name in cursive 'cause you'll never forget (Never forget)
Ooh na-na, ooh na-na, ooh na-na (Ooh)
Ooh na-na, ooh na-na, ooh na-na (Ooh-ooh)
Baby, you'll never forget, oh
Ooh na-na, ooh na-na, ooh na-na (Ooh)
Ooh na-na, ooh na-na, ooh na-na (Oh, na-na-na, ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
Real love, you're gettin' your first one, and you like it
It's gonna hurt, but you can't run, so don't fight it
Real love, you're gettin' your first one, and you like it
And you like it, oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm like a tattoo that's over your heart (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause once I put this love on you, it never comes off
I'm like a tattoo that's under your skin (Oh, baby)
So write my name in cursive 'cause you'll never forget (Oh, ooh)
Ooh na-na, ooh na-na, ooh na-na (Ooh)
Ooh na-na, ooh na-na, ooh na-na (Ooh-ooh)

[Outro]
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
