[Chorus]
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
By anyone but you
Anyone but you

[Verse 1]
You were the one I started falling
You got me down on the down low
Waiting for something
You are my baby, you call me baby
How could I've been so wrong?
Ho-how could I've been so wrong?

[Pre-Chorus]
You think I'm burning in hell while you out in paradise?
Well I got news for you, baby, I got some plans tonight
And all I'm gonna do, all I'm gonna do
All I'm gonna do, baby
Is anyone but you

[Chorus]
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
By anyone but you
Anyone but you
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
By anyone but you
Anyone but you

[Verse 2]
You left my side
When I needed, needed a hand to hold on to
And some loving
You are my baby, you call me baby
How could I've been so wrong?
Ho-how could I've been so wrong?

[Pre-Chorus]
You think I'm burning in hell while you out in paradise?
Well I got news for you, baby, I got some plans tonight
And all I'm gonna do, all I'm gonna do
All I'm gonna do, baby
Is anyone but you

[Chorus]
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
By anyone but you
Anyone but you
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
By anyone but you
Anyone but you

[Outro]
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
By anyone but you
Anyone but you
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
Just wanna be loved
By anyone but you
Anyone but you
