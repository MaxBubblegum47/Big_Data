Lyrics from Snippet

How are you, how you been?
Where you living these days?
I saw you moved on with it
Everyone, everything said you needed a change
But can I be honest?

Seeing you again makes me wanna try again
Makes me really wanna try again
Takes me back to when we thought it would never end
Can we try and go back to then?

You make me wanna try again
