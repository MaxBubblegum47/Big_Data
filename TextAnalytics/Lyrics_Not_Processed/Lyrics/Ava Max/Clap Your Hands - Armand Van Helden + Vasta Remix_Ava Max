[Intro]
Just clap your hands... [throughout]

[Verse 1]
Crazy stupid love
Let the the beat do what it does
Let the music lift you up
Tonight we got enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Just clap your hands...

[Chorus]
Crazy stupid love
Let the the beat do what it does
Let the music lift you up
Tonight we got enough

[Outro]
Just clap your hands...
