[Verse 1]
Never knew the sting of a stranger
Never felt the words like a razor
But I won't give a damn 'bout it later
All the little digs doesn't matter
Writin' down a brand new chapter
Where there's only love, never anger

[Pre-Chorus]
So lonely in your bed
Does breakin' me make you feel good?
Guess you don't understand
What goes around, comes around

[Chorus]
Don't ya know that I'm stronger?
Don't ya see me in all black?
Don't ya cry like a baby
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?
Know that it's over
Don't ya know I won't call back?
Don't ya cry like a baby
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?

[Verse 2]
You'll never see me blue, never bleedin'
Hope you understand how I'm feelin'
I'm turnin' off my phone like I'm leaving (Bye)
Pushed me to the edge, now it's over
Shuttin' off the hate, gettin' closure
This will be the dust when I'm older

[Pre-Chorus]
So lonely in your bed
Does breakin' me make you feel good?
Guess you don't understand
What goes around, comes around

[Chorus]
Don't ya know that I'm stronger?
Don't ya see me in all black?
Don't ya cry like a baby
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?
Know that it's over
Don't ya know I won't call back?
Don't ya cry like a baby
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?

[Post-Chorus]
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?

[Bridge]
It's comical, hysterical
So ridiculous, think you messed me up

[Chorus]
Don't ya know that I'm stronger?
Don't ya see me in all black?
Don't ya cry like a baby (Oh)
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?
Know that it's over
Don't ya know I won't call back? (Call back)
Don't ya cry like a baby
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?
