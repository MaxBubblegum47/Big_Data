[Chorus]
Play that song I like
Pull it on me right
Got Heaven on my mind
But I'm No Angel
No promises tonight
Show me your darker side
Got Heaven on my mind
But I'm No Angel

[Post-Chorus]
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh!
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh!
I'm no angel
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh!
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh!
I'm no angel

[Verse 1]
He, he, he doesn't know me
Got me fee, fee, feeling for more
I wanna see, see, see what I shouldn't
Wanna knock, knock, knock on the door

[Chorus]
Play that song I like
Pull it on me right
Got Heaven on my mind
But I'm No Angel
No promises tonight
Show me your darker side
Got Heaven on my mind
But I'm No Angel

[Post-Chorus]
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh!
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh!
I'm no angel
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh!
Oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh!
I'm no angel

[Verse 2]
He, he, he doesn't know me
Got me fee, fee, feeling for more
I wanna see, see, see what I shouldn't
Wanna knock, knock, knock on the door
