[Verse 1]
Never knew the sting of a stranger
Never felt the words like a razor
But I won't give a damn 'bout it later
All the little digs doesn't matter
Writin' down a brand new chapter
Where there's only love, never anger

[Pre-Chorus]
So lonely in your bed
Does breakin' me make you feel good?
Guess you don't understand
What goes around, comes around

[Chorus]
Don't ya know that I'm stronger?
Don't ya see me in all black?
Don't ya cry like a baby
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now? (Now, now, now, now)
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Baby
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?

[Verse 2]
You'll never see me bluе, never bleedin'
Hope you undеrstand how I'm feelin'
I'm turnin' off my phone like I'm leaving (Bye)
Pushed me to the edge, now it's over
Shuttin' off the hate, gettin' closure
This will be the dust when I'm older

[Pre-Chorus]
So lonely in your bed
Does breakin' me make you feel good?
Guess you don't understand
What goes around, comes around

[Chorus]
Don't ya know that I'm stronger?
Don't ya see me in all black?
Don't ya cry like a baby
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now? (Now, now, now, now)
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Baby
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?

[Outro]
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Who's laughing now?
