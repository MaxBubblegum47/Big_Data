[Chorus: Ava Max]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 1: Ava Max]
Can you hear the whispers all across the room?
You feel her eyes all over you like cheap perfume
You're beautiful, but misunderstood
So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood?

[Pre-Chorus: Ava Max]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this

[Chorus: Ava Max]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 2: Taeyong]
Baby, 맞아 내 속은 베베베 꼬였고 (Yo)
난 같지 Grinch 혹 녹색의 Berserker (Yo)
내 맘속에 친구 태용인 미아인지
오래 오랜 기간 동안
체류중이야 어딘가에서 난
난 누구일까?

[Pre-Chorus: Mark]
Baby you lit, so am I
I think you real, so am I
I like your walk and your vibe (And your vibe, and your vibe)
Baby you lit, so am I
I think you real, so am I
I know that you, you meant I
Just tell me one time

[Chorus: Ava Max & Jaehyun]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Bridge: Ava Max]
(Ah-ah-ah)
You're king and you're queen
You're strong then you're weak
You're bound but so free
(Ah-ah-ah)
So come and join me
And call me Harley
And we'll make 'em scream

[Chorus: Ava Max]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)
