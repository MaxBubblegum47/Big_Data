[Verse 1]
You, you take all of the li-li-light away
But, but then you give me fireworks
I, I think of leaving ni-ni-night and day
But, but then you always find the words

[Pre-Chorus]
You're contagious, baby
Love when you love me, hate me
The way you rock, ro-ro-rock my body lately
You set the rain on fire
I wish the lows were higher
Wish I could stop, stop, stop to save me

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna stay, wanna walk out the door
Oh no, right now, baby, I’m torn
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now, baby, I’m torn
You dry my tears and make it pour
You show me love and give me war
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn

[Verse 2]
I, I always want to run, run, run away
But, but then I crawl into your arms
It, it's like we're starting drama every day
But, but you know that's my favorite part

[Pre-Chorus]
You're contagious, baby
Love when you love me, hate me
The way you rock, ro-ro-rock my body lately
You set the rain on fire
I wish the lows were higher
Wish I could stop, stop, stop to save me

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna stay, wanna walk out the door
Oh no, right now, baby, I’m torn
I can’t get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now, baby, I’m torn
You dry my tears and make it pour
You show me love and give me war
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn

[Post-Chorus]
(Torn, torn, baby, I’m torn, torn)
(Torn, torn, baby, I'm torn, torn)

[Bridge]
Torn from the pages out of our book
A beautiful tragedy
I'm torn in-between Heaven and Hell
'Cause, baby, when I'm with you
I just don't know where I'd rather be

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna stay, wanna walk out the door
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn (Oh)
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn
You dry my tears and make it pour (Oh yeah)
You show me love and give me war
I can't get enough, can't take anymore (Oh woah)
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn
