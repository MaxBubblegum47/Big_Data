[Intro]
(Save Me)

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
(If all of the kings)

[Verse 1]
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours
(If all of the kings)

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
Wе would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who arе fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
(To all of the queens)

[Verse 2]
Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But I'm stronger than I ever was before

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
(If all of the kings)
(If all of the kings)
(If all of the kings)

[Bridge]
In chess, the king can move one space at a time
But queens are free to go wherever they like
You get too close, you'll get a royalty high
So breathe it in to feel alive

[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
(To all of the queens)
