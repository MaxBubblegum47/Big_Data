[Verse 1]
I had no way to know it
You should have given a clue
Cause I belong to somebody else
Now what the fuck am I supposed to do
I wish that you would've told me
'Cause I was feeling it too
And now I'm stuck living every day
In a imaginary world with you

[Chorus]
I hear you calling out my name
No one will never be ashamed
I feel you running through my veins
You always take away the pain, you always take away the pain
You always take away the pain

[Verse 2]
I wish that you would've noticed
You should have told me the truth
Now you belong to somebody and
So tell me what am I supposed to do
I'm hanging on by a moment
I hope it's killing you too
'Cause now I'm stuck living every day
In a imaginary world with you

[Chorus]
I hear you calling out my name
No one will never be ashamed
I feel you running through my veins
You always take away the pain, you always take away the pain
You always take away the pain, you always take away the pain
