[Verse 1]
You, you take all of the li-li-light away
But, but then you give me fireworks
I, I think of leaving ni-ni-night and day
But, but then you always find the words

[Pre-Chorus]
You're contagious, baby
Love when you love me, hate me
The way you rock, ro-ro-rock my body lately
You set the rain on fire
I wish the lows were higher
Wish I could stop, stop, stop to save me (Me, me...)

[Chorus]
I, I always want to run, run, run away
You, you take all of the li-li-light away
I, I always want to run, run, run away (Oh)
You, you take all of the li-li-light away
Torn, torn, oh
Torn, torn

[Verse 2]
I, I always want to run, run, run away
But, but then I crawl into your arms
It, it's like we're starting drama every day
But, but you know that's my favorite part

[Pre-Chorus]
You're contagious, baby
Love when you love me, hate me
The way you rock, ro-ro-rock my body lately
You set the rain on fire
I wish the lows were higher
Wish I could stop, stop, stop to save me (Me, me...)

[Chorus]
I, I always want to run, run, run away
You, you take all of the li-li-light away
I, I always want to run, run, run away (Oh)
You, you take all of the li-li-light away
Torn, torn, oh
Torn, torn
