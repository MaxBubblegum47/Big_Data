[Verse 1]
Wrap me in designer sheets and trace along this frame
Ask me why they used to say that trouble was my name
I've been playin’ a fool since I stepped into the game
Tell me I'm like Heaven, take the good Lord's name in vain

[Pre-Chorus]
But when I play my cards, keep ’em close to my chest
Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet
But underneath, I just need to forget
So come and get me undressed

[Chorus]
Well, you can take off all my clothes
And never see me naked
See me for real
If you don't know my heart
You're never gonna break it
Baby
Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul
I wanna show you my deepest secrets
I think I'm ready to be exposed
I want you watching me
When you take off all my clothes
And really see me naked
See me for real

[Verse 2]
If I let you leave the light on and I drop my guard
Promise that you'll see me for my truth and not my scars

[Pre-Chorus]
But when I play my cards, keep 'em close to my chest
Never fall in love, everybody loses their bet
But underneath, I just need to forget
So come and get me undressed

[Chorus]
Well, you can take off all my clothes
And never see me naked
See me for real
If you don't know my heart
You’re never gonna break it
Baby
Tell me if it’s safe to bare my soul
I wanna show you my deepest secrets
I think I'm ready to be exposed
I want you watching me
When you take off all my clothes
And really see me naked
See me for real

[Bridge]
If I keep my distance, I can’t connect with you
Lay my head on your chest and just surrender
Just surrender to you

[Chorus]
Well, you can take off all my clothes
And never see me naked
If you don't know my heart
You're never gonna break it, yeah
(Oh, you) Tell me if it's safe to bare my soul
I wanna show you my deepest secrets
I think I’m ready to be exposed
I want you watching me
When you take off all my clothes
And really see me naked
See me for real
