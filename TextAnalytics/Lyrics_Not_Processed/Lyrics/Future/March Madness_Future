[Intro]
Dress it up and make it real for me
Hahaha

(
808 Mafia

[Chorus]
Dirty soda in a Styrofoam (Yee)
Spend a day to get my mind blown (Mind blown)
Dress it up and go to NASA (Yeah)
Two hundred miles on the dash (Woo)
Gotta roll a pound up and gas it (Swear)
Switchin' lanes in a Grand Rapid (Switch)
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
'Til these niggas started actin' (We did it)
Shoot a nigga like a film, made a movie
Nigga, go'n let 'em have it (We did)
We ballin' like the March Madness (Yeah)
All these cops shootin' a nigga, tragic (Boom)
I'm the one that's livin' lavish (I'm the one)
Like I'm playin' for the Mavericks (Ballin')
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch (Woo)
The molly made me fuck her even though she average

[Verse 1]
Dirty muddy in the cup (Cup)
The .45 by my gut
My young nigga in the cut (Swear)
Take you out for some Jordans (Pluto)
Let's count this money, no rushin' (Freebandz)
I'm on a one way flushin' (Flushin')
Loud pack smellin' musty (Musty)
These fuckin' police can't touch me (Nah)
These bogus police can't touch me (Nah)
These fuckin' niggas can't touch me (Freeband Gang)
Apply the pressure with the VVS (Yeah, yeah)
I drive the foreign like it was a Chevy (Woo)
Drive the foreign like it was a Chevy (Skrrt)
Lift it up and go'n and offset it (Pluto)
Fuck a cougar like she Halle Berry (Pluto)
Future Hendrix, 
Dirty Sprite
, legendary (Dirty Sprite)

[Chorus]
Dirty soda in a Styrofoam (Yee)
Spend a day to get my mind blown (Mind blown)

[Verse 2]
Fuck on a basic bitch
We gon' wake up and smoke us a blunt and fuck
She gon' keep it so real with a nigga that
I'ma come back and always gon' fuck with her
Bend the curve in a Spur like a MARTA bus
I was workin' and servin' in Nautica (Yeah)
I get high 'til I'm higher than Mercury (High)
Fuck around, teach you that recipe (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck around, you gon' be out of here (Out of here)
Make her say, "Huh," like a nigga was Juvie
Soon as that work hit the city, we move it
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie (Movie)
Take the tool inside the club and just in case a nigga ever gotta use it (Future)
Get a pint of codeine, pour it up, nigga (Pour it up, nigga)
