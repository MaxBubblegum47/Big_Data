Leave a nigga rotten, say the word (Rot)
Pockets stuffed like a stockin', know ya heard (Know ya heard that)
Watchin' for the plottin' then the lurks (Watch, watch that)
Gotta feed ya family the first (Feed your family, stamina)
Runnin' on the money like turf (Whoop)
Stay out my lane, fuck it, I'ma merge (Swerve)

Lookin' for the drip, it's an unknown search (Where?)

I just want to cop me a Diablo (Diablo)

I ain't really sendin' no hearts though (On God)
Hit her from the back one time then call
That's a hit and run, bitch, call GEICO (21)
Six karats hangin' out my motherfuckin' earlobe
Shinin' like the glove on Michael (Jackson)
Got a couple hits, but he ain't right though (You cappin')
Richard Mille cost me a 'rari (And what?)
I don't play, boy, I'm not Carti (21!)
Left a wet dream on a Barbie (Excuse me)
Hit her best friend and she caught me (Heehee)
Hit her other friend, she was goin' though (Yeah)
Car in Zone 6, but it's foreign though (Yeah)
Treat my bitches like Jordans though
Only hit retro 10 when it's borin' though (She boring)
Savage got a Enzo, Benzo (Skrrt)
I don't got a whole lotta friends though (Fuck 'em)
But I got a whole lotta Ms though (Racks)
Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym ho (No cap)
In the club, iced out, snatch my chain
Get stomped by a whole lotta Timbs' though (Stupid)
I'm dunkin' on' your bitch like Tim bro (Free throw)
I let the block hit her, she Mutombo

Police chase, told Snake, let's make it (Make it)
Offset patient 'cause my heart beat racin' (Go)
So impatient 'cause I'm goin' big places
Miss the showroom floor, make the store get vacant (Damn)
And my bitch so bad, make your ho get naked (Mwah)

Pull up in the trey for the long-range facial (Yes)
Deep dish, big lip, rim Fantasia (Uh)
And I keep a Benzo tucked, yeah (Uh)
Copped two Maybach trucks, yeah (Wow)

So icy my whole career (It's Gucci)
