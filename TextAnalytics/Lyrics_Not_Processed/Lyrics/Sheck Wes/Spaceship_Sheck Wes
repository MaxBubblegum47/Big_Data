[Chorus: Don Toliver]
I get a lil' impatient (Yeah, yeah)
Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship?
Sellin' all Alicia Keys, she on my playlist (Yeah, yeah)
I am not receiving, you know I don't take shit
I, I, I spilled lean all in my ride (Lean all in my ride)
Dumpin' ashes on your thigh (Ashes on your thigh)
You might be ready for surprise, oh
I get a lil' impatient (Yeah, yeah)
Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship?
Sellin' all Alicia Keys, she on my playlist (Yeah, yeah)
I am not receiving, you know I don't take shit

[Verse 1: Don Toliver]
I'm in my spaceship (Whatever), getting that facelift (Uh-huh)
LA daytrip, I'm eating them rib tips
Call up the ref, I'm balling, pouring it, so we're falling
Twenty-five hundred for the cardigan, Saint Laurent, my dawgs in

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Sheck Wes]
I get a little impatient
Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship?
Sellin' all Alicia Keys, she on my playlist
I am not receiving, you know I don't take shit
It's the new age flex, hoppin' out of the jet
Spend a ticket on Rolex, plus the ice on your neck
Bust it down and collect, send that money through text
You can hit me on my phone, you can call me direct
I, I, I spilled lean all in my ride
Dumpin' ashes on your thigh (Yeah)
You might be ready for surprise, oh

[Verse 2: Sheck Wes]
Yeah, hotbox my SUV (Bitch), nobody can breathe (At all)
I ain't never fear a thing (No), baby, in your dreams (Dreams)
Sheck Wes, fear don't sleep (Uh)
Air Force 1s, no crease (Crease)
Someone arrest my jeans (Simons)
Blunt lit in my face (Face)
Diamonds in my teeth
Pick, um, the VVS
She ain't really got no meaning, uh
In a fast car, I'm speeding, uh
And I can't wait for no red light (Red light)
If I'm chasing this green (Go)
I need more M's than B's (B's)
Sheck and Don on a different time and payment
All my cars from Europe, his car from Avis
Every day I wake up, new whips hit the pavement
I had to watch my living, I don't know no limits at all, all, all

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
I get a lil' impatient (Yeah, yeah)
Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship?
Sellin' all Alicia Keys, she on my playlist (Yeah, yeah)
I am not receiving, you know I don't take shit
I, I, I spilled lean all in my ride (Lean all in my ride)
Dumpin' ashes on your thigh (Ashes on your thigh)
You might be ready for surprise, oh
