[Verse 1]
I feel so happy
Happy that I'm free
And I can see things
Things I couldn't see

[Pre-Chorus]
I can be out every night (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
No one else holdin' me down (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can do just what I like (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
But I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
Please, don't fall in love without me

[Verse 2]
I hope you're sorry
Can't find the words to say
Hope you're always worried
Worryin' 'bout me

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you think I give a fuck? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Give a fuck 'bout who you fuck? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I hope you can't get it up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
I can't fall in love without you
Please, don't fall in love without me

[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh)
I can't fall in love without you
(Ooh, ooh)
I can't fall in love without you
So please, don't fall in love without me
