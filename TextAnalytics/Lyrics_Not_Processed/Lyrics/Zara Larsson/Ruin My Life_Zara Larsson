[Verse 1]
I miss you pushing me close to the edge
I miss you
I wish I knew what I had when I left
I miss you

[Pre-Chorus]
You set fire to my world, couldn't handle the heat
Now I'm sleeping alone and I'm starting to freeze
Baby, come bring me hell
Let it rain over me
Baby, come back to me

[Chorus]
I want you to ruin my life
You to ruin my life, yeah, to ruin my life, yeah
I want you to fuck up my nights, yeah
Fuck up my nights, yeah, all of my nights, yeah
I want you to bring it all on
If you make it all wrong, then I'll make it all right, yeah
I want you to ruin my life
Yeah, to ruin my life, yeah, to ruin my life

You to ruin my life, yeah, to ruin my life, yeah

[Verse 2]
I miss you more than I thought that I could
I miss you
I know you missin' me too like you should

[Pre-Chorus]
You set fire to my world, couldn't handle the heat
Now I'm sleeping alone and I'm starting to freeze
Baby, come bring me hell
