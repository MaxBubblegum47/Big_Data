[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
(What do girls like?)
Said I was the man
All I ever needed was a plan
Tell J.K. that I'm still rollin'
Yeah, tell Russell I'm a brand
Yeah, bust that skank
Ain't nobody messing with the gang
Might take a flight out for the weekend
Yeah, and go Cannes â€˜cause I can
Go low, go low, everybody get low
Had a couple hits and a couple solos
Now I got a couple BRITs and a couple MOBOs
Dropped "Pass Out", everybody loco
I was dropping off the mandem in my Polo
Now I'm with the mandem at the polo
I could make a honey give away her last Rolo
And I stay sho, yo, you know how it goes
All the girls like...

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I know what boys like
I know what they want
They want that good thing
They wanna get some
(All the girls like)
I know what boys like
I know what they want
So go ahead and prove me right
That's what girls like

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, Roley on the wrist, that's me, me
Man of the year, I'm fleeky
Heard a couple man wanna be me
Them man can't be TT
Tell 'em only winners are allowed
No diggidy, no diggiy-doubt
I was getting blowed before girls were putting out
Told them I was gonna blow back when I was in the south
Go low, go low, everybody go low
Since she want me, she don't want the coco
So I made her sing it back, like she was Moloko
And I got a Merc, I ain't got a Volvo
Used to have a black Nokia Sirocco
Now everywhere I go, people want a photo
I could make a honey give away her last Rolo
And I stay sho, yo, you know how I roll
All the girls like...

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I know what boys like
I know what they want
They want that good thing
They wanna get some
(All the girls like)
I know what boys like
I know what they want
So go ahead and prove me right
That's what girls like

[Interlude: Zara Larsson]
Don't need me a guy who's a friend
Better pick me up in a Benz
I like cruisin' around the West End
No Netflix and chill, that's dead
(All the girls like)
Every day you ride with your friends
(All the girls like)
I don't need your money for my rent
(All the girls like)
I'm not an 8 or a 9, I'm a 10
(All the girls like)
What's the code to your Wi-Fi again?

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
(All the girls like)
I know what boys like
I know what they want
They want that good thing
They wanna get some
(All the girls like)
I know what boys like
I know what they want
(All the girls like)
So go ahead and prove me right
That's what girls like

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
All the girls like, said I was the man
All I ever needed was a plan
Tell J.K. that I'm still rollin'
Yeah, tell Russell I'm a brand
Yeah, bust that skank
Ain't nobody messing with the gang
Might take a flight out for the weekend, yeah
And go Cannes cause I can
Go low, go low, everybody get low
Had a couple hits and a couple solos
Now I got a couple BRITs and a couple MOBOs
Dropped "Pass Out", everybody loco
I was dropping off the mandem in my Polo
Now I'm with the mandem at the polo
I could make a honey give away her last Rolo
And I stay sho, yo, you know how it goes
All the girls like...

[Outro: Zara Larsson]
I know what boys like
I know what they want
(All the girls like)
I know what boys like
I know what they want
(All the girls like)
I know you, I know you want the good thing
(All the girls like)
I know what boys like
I know what they want
