[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not even in a gown
I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch
The way you want me makes me want you now
The only thing you have to say is (Wow)

[Verse 1]
And I feel this way with no chemicals
In my system, babe, it's incredible
When you're touching me, yeah, that says it all
You said it all (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not even in a gown
I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch
The way you want me makes me want you now
The only thing you have to say is (Wow)

[Post-Chorus]
Make your jaw drop-drop
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion
Make your jaw drop-drop
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion
Make your jaw drop-drop
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion

[Verse 2]
And you make me feel so fucking pretty
Take loving me to a new extreme
If I can't have you, I don't want no one
I don't want no one
As you make me dance in the middle of the street
On the hardwood floor, we should be asleep
If I can't have you, I don't want no one
I don't want no one, want no one, want no one

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not even in a gown
I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch
The way you want me makes me want you now
The only thing you have to say is (Wow)

[Post-Chorus]
Make your jaw drop-drop
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion
Make your jaw drop-drop
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion

[Outro]
Never, never, never, oh
Never, never, never, oh
Never, never, never, oh
Never, never, never, oh
