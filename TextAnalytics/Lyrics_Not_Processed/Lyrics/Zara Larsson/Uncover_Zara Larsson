[Intro]
Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others
Close to each other

[Verse 1]
In the daylight, in the daylight
When the sun is shinin'
On a late night, on a late night
When the moon is blindin'
In plain sight, plain sight
Like stars in hidin'
You and I burn on, on

[Pre-Chorus]
Put two and together, forever
We'll never change
Two and together
We'll never change

[Chorus]
Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others, close to each other
That's when we uncover-cover-cover
That's when we uncover-cover-cover

[Verse 2]
My asylum, my asylum
Is in your arms
When the world gives heavy burdens
I can bare a thousand tons
On your shoulder, on your shoulder
I can reach an endless sky
Feels like paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
Put two and together, forever
We'll never change
Two and together
We'll never change

[Chorus]
Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others, close to each other
That's when we uncover-cover-cover
That's when we uncover-cover-cover

[Bridge]
We could build a universe right here
All the world could disappear
Wouldn't notice, wouldn't care
We could build a universe right here
The world could disappear
Yeah, I just need you near

[Chorus]
Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others, close to each other
That's when we uncover-cover-cover
That's when we uncover-cover-cover
That's when we uncover
