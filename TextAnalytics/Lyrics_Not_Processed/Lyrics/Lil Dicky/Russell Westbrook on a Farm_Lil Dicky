[Verse: Lil Dicky]
Ain’t no doubt about it, shit is coming
And I’m just praying that Lil Dicky love it
Always told myself that this the type of shit I wanted
I was being honest, even made a promise
Not with anybody else, this was inner conscious
Talking to my fucking self, das' a little bonkers
I know, I still got a lot of shit to conquer
I hope that ain't even my concern though
You know I’ll be working till I get what I deserve
Whatever totems I get personally you know I’ma earn those
This ain't even 'bout some shit up on a checklist
This about the fact that I’m about to test this
I’m about to figure out what my best is
I can't avoid it because now ya' boy invested
And I ain't gotta a choice except to smile and accept it
Pretty reckless, pretty restless 'cause
I’ve lived my life expecting love
To come the second my attempt was done, and yeah, I guess
To some extent I was correct because I’m getting buzz
But now I’m 'bout to be ubiquitous, look it up
Yeah, or that’s at least what I’m assuming
But as alluded to reality is looming and
Now ya' dude about to make a move and take the truth
And hope to God that when he through
That what he thought about is proven
But honestly, I'm not afraid that it’s delusion
I’m hot enough to where I know it’s not illusion
But obviously I been finding this confusing
This ain’t even close to what I thought I would be doing
Don’t get me wrong, I was born to be big
But I always figured it would be the comedy thing
So I started rapping just to see what drama it brings
What big dogs from sitcoms would holler at me
And as the time past, I rhymed faster, lines crafted
Was high class as I mastered my craft, and
Goddamn, who’da thought it get like this
Back in twenty-ten music wouldn’t make that list
I’m talking top five-to-ten strengths, with no winks
I would not lie, my pen dry, with no ink
Or, that’s at least what I thought 'til I clawed and scratched the pen 'til I saw a line draw
Then I coulda let bygones be bygones
But I really wanted to rhyme till my line drawn
Like where the fuck is my peak at?
Not Brown but I make it pop, then I beat that
Not crowned yet, but I don’t think I decreed that
Not loud, but you know I’m ready to tweet that
I just really hope I’m ready to be that
Now you seeing where D’s at
'Cause even though I’m softer than a tissue
I ain't nothing to sneeze at
I’m smarter, where fuck ya' degrees at
And I ain't harder but I’m hotter homie, where da fuck ya degrees at
I’m 'bout to come in and desaturate
The chic rap today and evaporate
The feedback I hate, I elaborate
At a later date
But I’m getting off the point with the player hate
What the fuck was I saying, oh yeah
I’m kind of a slave
To my ambition, I ain't quittin' till my shit is appraised
And I admit it, I predict that where I finish is crazy
But that just means that it’s further away
So, Burd about to work until he turn in his grave
It’s really burdensome when earning something’s fun for the day
But I’m concerned about da' burning out from upping the stakes
I’m always uppin' the stakes
I’m taking dinner meetings in New York, always up for the steaks
We exploring the discussion of great
They assuring me that when I’m more elite I’ll be secure and amazed
But this isn’t insecurity mang…
Like this the opposite of that, confidence in fact
My biggest problem is I can't honestly relax
Because inside of me a damn odyssey enacts
And I made a promise that I can't be the body
That’s stopping it, think I need a lobotomy
Lil Dicky the prophecy, little bit of anomaly, not a commodity
Not a façade, or a lotta da Comedy prodigies
Commonly brought up wit Dicky
Feelin' weird, lemme think of an analogy
Just imagine for a second what if Russell Westbrook never knew his own mentality
Grew up on a farm where the biggest commonality
Was people that conform to the ruralest localities
To Russell though it was nuffin' but normality
And he really nice up on the plow in actuality
Everybody liked the kid and dug his personality
And so da mutuality was somewhat rationality
So then ya man made a plan of practicality
Not even a plan, it was more of a formality
Get a little land and attend to its vitality
Then raise a little fam 'til it all became finality
The strategy was just to stay in the course
And do ya chores, when ya' happy ya' ain't need to abort
Never explored nothing less he rollin' round on his horse
Then one day he was up on his horse
That’s when he went past the porch, the path he normally
Passes forth was fast and short, was after more
Went faster north, amassed a lure to master more
And then discovered the court
He like ya! Let me down Tim
Hopped off, lookin' puzzled at the round rim
Saw a ball up in the corner on the ground then
Russell started dribbling and giggling astounded
Then he shot a brick and then a brick and then he downed it
And when he hit it Russell listened to the fuckin' sound friction
Up in a swish make and he was confounded
Because he knew that he had found him
But right now; it was still for the fun
Just a way to kill the time when the farming was done
Then the walking turned to running, and the hoppin' turned to jumping
And dunking, and Russell had to keep coming
Because the young’n was fucking disgusting and loving it
Running it, all of a sudden the public started to come in abundance and fuck wit him
'Cause he was butter and hungry, hung jury
'Cause stories of glory, not normally for people like him
Then the word got around up to ESPN
And they flying Russell down to compete in the gym
Bunch a grown men lookin' to belittle the kid
Because to those men, ball was the reason to live
And the G.O.A.T.S. they been all in since they was kids
So this goat owning mafucka look like a dick
And even know Russell knows that, he doesn’t submit
He just chills with a grin
And then the game start, and this muthafucka take charge
Make it rain, hard D up on these bitches making children of men
Lookin' better than his predecessors ever could get
Turned the animosity to respect
And then the Thunder called him
Said they heard a lot about the ballin'
Told him that they wanna get involved and
Showed him all the shit that you can get up in the league, it’s so appalling
Oklahoma City in the autumn, hella pretty
Awesome, errbody laud him
Erry-bitty lookin' like they really fucking fallin'
Condominium is so legitimate it’s sprawling
And this muthafucka on the court straight ballin'
Cash all up in that ass, lol’ing at the past like
Where the fuck would I be at up on the other path, right?
If I never stumbled 'pon the game then think of that life
Shit, who taking care of my farm?
Who taking care of my farm?
Who taking care of my farm?
I really loved that farm, uh

CAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE
Five-hundred million now that’s a pound cake
According to Jay Z, and Drake…
But greatness ain’t about cake
