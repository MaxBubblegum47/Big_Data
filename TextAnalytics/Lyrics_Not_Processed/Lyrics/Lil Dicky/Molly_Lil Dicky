[Intro: Lil Dicky]
Yeah... man, this is the softest thing I ever did
But... it's about something that's pretty important to me

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
And that's you
And that's true
Really wish that I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life

[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]
Fuck it, I don't even know what I could've done
Looking back thinking, "That's what I should've done"
Wanting you back
But when the fact is I always put you second to rap
I'm not mad that you wouldn't come
And even though I had to move, I ain't move on
Really wish you was a boo I could prove wrong
But she knows what I'ma do with the new songs
And she know I'm pretty soon with your dude on, running the rap game
With that lane always gotta be up on that train
Or that plane, ain't nobody want to feel that pain
With that strain wishin' I ain't gotta get that fame
Or acclaim, you know I'd give you my last name
Put that blame on me, chasin' something, feelin' dumb cause you all I need
Hope you wait until I'm done and I'm all free
But you know I never know when that's gon' be
And I'm sorry

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
It's the hardest rule to follow
(I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you
(What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe
If I woke up and I called it quits
(I'm thinking of you)
If today I gave up all of this
(I don't know what to do)
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
And that's you (that's you)
And that's true (that's true)
Really wish that I didn't
Care about you anymore (care about you anymore)
But I do
What do I do when the rap life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life
(had life, had life, had life)

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]
When I'm being dumb and stupid who the fuck is gonna hit me with the motherfuckin' jerk face?
Who gon' let me know to hit my mother on her birthday?
Who gon' let me know when I be shopping if a shirt's gay?
And when I'm on the road I be missing that
Always looking at my phone, you would give me crap
Ever since I been alone I've been thinking back
Listenin' to your autotune in my mic'phone making us laugh
You know the past was a blast but it never could last
Pretty sad when your love got a separate path
Used to read when there's nothing to do
But it's funny, doing nothin's never nothin' when it's somethin' with you
You know I want to still talk, even text and call
Whenever something's going on I be pressin' "Mol" up in the phone
'Til I press the "x," stressed, the next one'll best the ex and you'll forget, but it's best
You the best to me girl, always baked me something
And when it ripped off, you replaced my buttons
But don't be pissed off if I hate your husband
'Cause even when I can't say "love ya," I love ya

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
It's the hardest rule to follow
(I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you
(What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe
If I woke up and I called it quits
(I'm thinking of you)
If today I gave up all of this
(I don't know what to do)
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow (oh)
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby

[Hook: Lil Dicky]
And that's you (that's you)
And that's true (that's true)
Really wish that I didn't
Care about you anymore (care about you anymore)
But I do
What do I do when the rap life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life
(had life, had life, had life)

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
It's the hardest rule to follow
(I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you
(What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe
If I woke up and I called it quits
(I'm thinking of you)
If today I gave up all of this
(I don't know what to do)
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby
