[Intro: Lil Dicky]
What up, world? It's your boy, just one of the guys down here. Well, I could be more specific. Uh, I'm a human, and I just wanted to, you know, for the sake of all of us earthlings out there, just wanted to say:

[Chorus: Lil Dicky]
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home

Hi, I'm a baboon
I'm like a man, just less advanced and my anus is huge

Hey, I'm a zebra
No one knows what I do, but I look pretty cool
Am I white or black?

We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
I'm a man (Hello?)
Can you hear me? (Anyone out there? Hello?)
I've trudged the Earth for so damn long
And still don't know shit (What's going on?)
I hope it's not a simulation (Huh)
Give each other names like Ahmed and Pedro
And, yeah, we like to wear clothes, girls still look beautiful
And it covers up our human dick (Woo), eat a lot of tuna fish
But these days, it's like we don't know how to act
All these shootings, pollution, we under attack on ourselves
Like, let's all just chill (Hey), respect what we built (Hey)
Like look at the internet! It's cracking as hell
Fellas, don't you love to cum when you have sex? (Ayy)
And I heard women orgasms are better than a dick's (Uh)
So what we got this land for? What we gotta stand for?
Love, and we love the Earth (The Earth)

[Ariana Grande]
Oh, yeah, baby, I love the Earth
I love this planet

[Lil Dicky]
Hey, Russia, we're cool
Hey, Asia, all of you, c'mon
Every one of you from the plains to the Sahara
Let's come together and live

[Choir]
Hum-dum-dum-dae-dum, hum-dum-dum-dae-dum

[PSY]
우-우-우리는 지구를 사랑해요

Amamos la tierra

(We love you, we love you)
C'mon everybody, I know we're not all the same
But we're living on the same Earth
(We love you, we love you)
Have you ever been to Earth?
Everyone who is listening has been to Earth, Ariana
(We love you, we love you)
We're not making music for aliens here
Are we gonna die?
You know what, Bieber? We might die
(We love you, we love you)
I'm not going to lie to you
I mean, there's so many people out here who don't think global warming's a real thing. You know? We gotta save this planet. We're being stupid
Unless we get our shit together now
