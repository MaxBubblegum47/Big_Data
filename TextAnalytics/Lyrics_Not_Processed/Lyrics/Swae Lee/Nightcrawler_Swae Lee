[Intro: Swae Lee]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, uh

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Did you have the time of your life?
Let's have the afterparty at my place
Ayy, do you have some spare change?
On me, I've got hundreds I'll throw in your face

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young, free, and wildin', order more kidneys

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Dope, I'm so dope
All these hunnies pilin' on the floor
And we stuntin', know you see the glow
Throw these hundreds, thought I'd let you know
Since LA, I've been puttin' on
Cirque du Soleil, goin' on and on
I got this money, tell me what you want
For this money, can you drop it low?

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young, free, and wildin', order more kidneys
Mm, when the night calls, oh-oh-oh
When the night calls, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, order more bottles (Order more bottles)
Order more models (Order more models)
Order more hours (Order more hours)
Shots on an island (Shots on an island)
Hotter than the summer (Hotter than the summer)
The winter couldn't chill me (The winter couldn't chill me)
Young, free, and wildin' (Young, free, and wildin')
So order more kidneys (So order more kidneys)

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Freaks come out at night
We bring our fantasy to life
Point me to the ice
And I don't need your drink, high off life
Uh, someone kill the lights
I brought the party favors, just get piped
All my bitches right
But I want you and you tonight

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, order more bottles (Order more bottles)
Order more models (Order more models)
Order more hours (Order more hours)
Shots on an island (Shots on an island)
Hotter than the summer (Hotter than the summer)
The winter couldn't chill me (The winter couldn't chill me)
Young, free, and wildin' (Young, free, and wildin')
So order more kidneys (So order more kidneys)

[Refrain: Travis Scott]
When the night crawls
All the money, all the hoes, and the alcohol
All these hundreds and these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night calls
We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol
All these hundreds, all these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls

[Verse 4: Chief Keef]
Ayy, walked up in the bank (Bank)
Ordered me some funds (Beep)
Walked in the strip club
Order me some ones (Gang)
I walked up in the gun store (Huh?)
Ordered me some guns (Bang-bang)
Your bitch walked up in the spot
And she ordered me for lunch (Gang, gang)
I just ordered me some brunch (Ayy)
Korean spicy garlic (Ayy)
Bitch, I come from eating McDonald's (Uh-huh)
Girl, you know I'm from the projects (Ayy)
Like I'm a G, I come through mobbin'
Like Wu-T-A-N-G, we come through wildin'
I ain't chicken, Killer Caesar with the chopper (Bang-bang)
Boy, you don't blow no poles, I know, I know (No, no, no)
I got me some angles
I got me some money, fuck, I got me some haters (Ayy)
I got me some FedEx (Ayy, ayy), I got me some cake
I got me some UPS, I got me a freight, ayy (Gang, gang)
Order some more money (Beep)
Order some more money (Beep)
Order some more money (Beep)
Order some more bottles (Ayy)
Order some more bitches (Ayy)
Order some more money (Gang)
I know you wanna be rich, bitch (Gang, gang)

[Refrain: Travis Scott]
When the night crawls
All the money, all the hoes, and the alcohol
All these hundreds and these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night calls
We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol
All these hundreds, all these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night crawls
All the money, all the hoes, and the alcohol
All these hundreds and these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night calls
We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol
All these hundreds, all these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
