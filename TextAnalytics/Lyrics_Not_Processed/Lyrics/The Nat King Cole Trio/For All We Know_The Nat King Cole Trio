For all we know we may never meet again
Before you go make this moment sweet again
We won't say Good night; until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it

For all we know this may only be a dream
We come and go like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we know

Instrumental interlude

So love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we know
