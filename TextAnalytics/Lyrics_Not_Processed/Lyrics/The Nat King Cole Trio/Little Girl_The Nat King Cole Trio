Little girl
You're the one girl for me
Little girl
You're as sweet as can be
Just a glance at you meant
Love from the start
And oh, what a thrill came
Into my heart
Little girl
With your cute little ways
I am yours
For the rest of my days
And this great big world
Will be divine
Little girl
When you are mine, oh mine, yeah
And this great big world
Will be divine
Little girl
When you're mine, oh mine
