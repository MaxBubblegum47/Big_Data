[Verse 1]
I dreamed of you last week
Remembered old memories
Cryin' in my sleep
But I'd rather dream of nothin' at all
The more I think I grow
The less I seem to know
Oh, oh, no
You saw me sing last week
I was hopin' you might ask
"Is this one about me?"
But how could you just say nothin' at all?
The more I think I grow
The less I seem to know
Oh, oh, no

[Chorus]
Julia, I'm through with ya
Julia, I'm through with ya

[Post-Chorus]
Thought we'd never see the sun fade
Now we'll never see that shit shinin'
Did we use to fear the dark days?
'Cause now I'm dancin' in the moonlight
Above the city lights, yeah
Where all the shooting stars eventually die, yeah (
We lost on that
)
We're burned into the sky a million times
Oh, oh, mmm
Ooh

[Interlude]
We're up

[Verse 2]
Movin' at light speed
And I don't need gravity
Runnin' on empty
Isn't it nice to just feel nothin' at all?
I think I finally know
The reason I let go

[Chorus]
Julia, I'm through with ya
Julia, I'm through with ya

[Post-Chorus]
Thought we'd never see the sun fade
Now we'll never see that shit shinin'
Did we use to fear the dark days? (Julia)
'Cause now I'm dancing in the moonlight (I'm through with ya)
Above the city lights, yeah
Where all the shooting stars eventually die (Julia; die)
We're burned into the sky a million times
Oh, oh, mmm
Ooh

[Interlude]
Well, just ignore this one

[Chorus]
Julia, I'm through with ya
Julia, I'm through with ya
