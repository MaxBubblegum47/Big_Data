[Verse 1]
Driving down the interstate
I've never felt so far away
Leaving hardly hurts at all
I'm sorry that I never call

[Pre-Chorus]
Often, I get exhausted
Trying regardless to be enough
Is it selfish not to be selfless
When all I can help is to open up?

[Chorus]
I'll be better than I was before
Despite every text of yours ignored
Will you call me still, just to hear my voice?
I swear, always, I'll care
I'll care

[Verse 2]
Flipping through our photographs
Those moments never seem to last
Listening to self-control
There's feelings that you'll never know

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave me, it's never easy
I've had a lifetime to be alone
If you let me, when it gets heavy
No, I'll never let you be all alone

[Chorus]
I'll be better than I was before (Hey)
Despite every text of yours ignored (Hey)
Will you call me still, just to hear my voice?
I swear, always
Always
Always, I'll care

[Outro]
Always
