[Intro]
I mean, I can do the verse of it just through

[Verse 1]
Yeah, tomorrow is your birthday
I thought it was last Thursday, girl
We know you love a party
Go celebrate and I'll be

[Pre-Chorus]
On my way to distant shores
If you weren't so insecure
You'd learn to close each open door for me
Oh, babe

[Chorus]
Hang up if you ever think of calling
Me up, not afraid to say it, darling
Sorry, I'm not sorry if it hurts
I don't mean to make it worse
I've decided that I'm not your fucking friend
Right now, there's not much that we agree on
Sit down if you need someone to lean on
Honest, if I'm coming to your place
It's to say it to your face
I've decided that I'm not your fucking friend

[Verse 2]
I think you might be okay
Could care less what your friends say
Well, I'd rather sit in silence
Than be here while you're crying

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, watch me disappear
Ignorance is bliss, I hear, and
I have always been sincere to you
Oh, babe

[Chorus]
Hang up if you ever think of calling
Me up, not afraid to say it, darling
Sorry, I'm not sorry if it hurts
I don't mean to make it worse
I've decided that I'm not your fucking friend
Right now, there's not much that we agree on
Sit down if you need someone to lean on
Honest, if I'm coming to your place
It's to say it to your face
I've decided that I'm not your fucking friend

[Bridge]
I've decided that I'm not your fucking friend
I've decided that I'm not your—

[Chorus]
Hang up if you ever think of calling
Me up, not afraid to say it, darling
Sorry, I'm not sorry if it hurts
I don't mean to make it worse
I've decided that I'm not your fucking friend
Right now, there's not much that we agree on
Sit down if you need someone to lean on
Honest, if I'm coming to your place
It's to say it to your face
I've decided that I'm not your fucking friend

[Outro]
I've decided that I'm not your fucking friend
(I'm not sorry)
I've decided that I'm not your fucking friend
