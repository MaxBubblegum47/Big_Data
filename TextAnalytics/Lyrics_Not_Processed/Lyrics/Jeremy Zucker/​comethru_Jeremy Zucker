[Verse 1]
I might lose my mind
Waking when the sun's down
Riding all these highs
Waiting for the comedown
Walk these streets with me
I'm doing decently
Just glad that I can breathe, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to realize
It's alright to not be fine on your own

[Chorus]
Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee
These last few weeks have been exhausting
I'm lost in my imagination
And there's one thing that I need from you

[Hook]
Can you come through, through
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you
Can you come through?

[Verse 2]
Ain't got much to do
Too old for my hometown
Went to bed at noon
Couldn't put my phone down
Scrolling patiently
It's all the same to me
Just faces on a screen, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to realize
It's alright to not be fine on your own

[Chorus]
Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee
These last few weeks have been exhausting
I'm lost in my imagination
And there's one thing that I need from you

[Hook]
Can you come through, through
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you
Can you come through, through
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you
Can you come through?
