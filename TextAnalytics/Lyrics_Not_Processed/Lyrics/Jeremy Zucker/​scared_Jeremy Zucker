[Verse 1]
Don't move, there's a lion next to you
I pray that your soul survives it through another day
'Cause in my dreams, there were angels circling
I could see everything you ever wanted me to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I see oceans in your eyes
It makes me scared
So if we both drown

[Chorus]
Ooh, don't be scared
I'm right here
And what is fear
When no one knows
What comes next?
So yeah, I'm scared
But I won't let it get to me

[Verse 2]
You know I've been writing you a poem
So I spoke all the words I ever wanted you to know

[Pre-Chorus]
I see oceans in your soul
It makes me scared
So if we both drown

[Chorus]
Ooh, don't be scared
I'm right here
And what is fear
When no one knows
What comes next?
So yeah, I'm scared
But I won't let it get to me
