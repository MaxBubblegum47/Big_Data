(Verse 1)
Oh no, this can't be happening
Oh no, I'm crawling out my skin

You said just a sip
Won't hurt anyone
But your kiss
There's never just one

Oh no, this can't be happening
This can't be happening
I'm going back again
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

(Chorus)
You hit me like a relapse
You keep on calling me back
I'm shaking in a cold sweat
You know I gotta have that

I can't stop
Can't get enough
Cause baby once I get a taste
It's all I want

You hit me like a relapse
A relapse

(Verse 2)
I know that I'm no shades of grey
Yeah I know, it's black and white, almost nothing at all

Here we are
Down on the floor
We don't care
Who needs it more

Oh no, this can't be happening
This can't be happening
I'm going back again
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

(Chorus)
You hit me like a relapse
You keep on calling me back
I'm shaking in a cold sweat
You know I gotta have that

I can't stop
Can't get enough
Cause baby once I get a taste
It's all I want

You hit me like a relapse
A relapse

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (x4)

I can't stop
Can't get enough
Cause baby once I get a taste
It's all I want
All I want

I can't stop
Can't get enough
Cause baby once I get a taste
It's all I want

(Chorus)
You hit me like a relapse
You keep on calling me back
I'm shaking in a cold sweat
You know I gotta have that

I can't stop
Can't get enough
Cause baby once I get a taste
It's all I want

You hit me like a relapse
A relapse

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (x4)
(You hit me like a relapse, a relapse)

(Ending)
I don't ever wanna run out of you, sinking higher
You're the only one I ever want to use
