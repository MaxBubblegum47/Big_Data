[Chorus: Shawn Hook, 
Vanessa Hudgens
 & 
Both
]
She keeps reminding me
That you’re still gone
And I’m still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

[Verse 1: Shawn Hook]
Wine, she’s spitting out the wine
I forgot you left behind
Our favorite cherry red
Oh, love, I know this isn’t love
'Cause I’m still thinking of you
While she’s getting undressed
I never should have left

[Chorus: Shawn Hook]
She keeps reminding me
That you’re still gone
And I’m still lonely
She keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Hook]
In love, love
She keeps reminding me
How good it was, was
She keeps reminding me

[Verse 2: Vanessa Hudgens]
Nights, I miss the faded nights
Staying out 'til morning light
Having breakfast in bed
Now he, he's laying in the sheets
The ones you bought for me
All tangled in a mess
It should be you instead

[Chorus: Shawn Hook & Vanessa Hudgens]
He keeps reminding me
That you’re still gone
And I’m still lonely
He keeps reminding me how good it was
When we were crazy

[Post-Chorus]
In love, love
He keeps reminding me
How good it was, was
He keeps reminding me

[Bridge: Shawn Hook & Vanessa Hudgens]
Well, I’m tryna forget you with no regrets
But I’m still hanging onto the memories that you left
I deleted your number with every text
I’m still tryna forget you, forget you

[Chorus: Shawn Hook, 
Vanessa Hudgens
 & 
Both
]
She keeps reminding me
That you’re still gone
And I’m still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy
She keeps reminding me
That you’re still gone
And I’m still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Hook & Vanessa Hudgens]
In love, love
She keeps reminding me
How good it was, was
She keeps reminding me

[Outro: Shawn Hook]
Wine, she’s spitting out the wine
I forgot you left behind
