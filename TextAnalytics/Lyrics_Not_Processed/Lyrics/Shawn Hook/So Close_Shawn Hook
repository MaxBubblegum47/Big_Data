I'm walking to the sound
The blood that moves around inside me
The beat drops in my heart
Below my feet, the stars can lift me

Lanes are all clear
I've always dreamed that I'd be here, but this seems too weird

So close I can taste it
I've waited all my life (for this)
And I don't wanna waste it
I've chased this all my life (I'm so close)

This town will test your fate
Will put you in your place, and leave you
Where everyone's a name
And everything's a game of who's-who

The cards are in play
I'm sitting on a hand that no one can take away

So close I can taste it
I've waited all my life (for this)
And I don't wanna waste it
I've chased this all my life (I'm so close)
Oh, so close
So close
I've been so close all my life

I'm in need and
I believe that
I'll find a way somehow all my life

Lanes are all clear
I've always dreamed that I'd be
So close that I can taste it
I've waited all my life (for this)
And I don't wanna waste it
I've chased this all my life (I'm so close)

All the ways I've been shut out
Yeah, I've been lost and found
The tears and the breakdowns
Have made me stronger now

I'm in need and
I believe that
I'll find a way somehow all my life
