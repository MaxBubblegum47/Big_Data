[Verse 1]
You were my courage
My sword and shield
Grace under pressure
My wall of steel
I was a stone
Weighing us down
You were the angel I chained to the ground
I miss the way you undress
I miss your head on my chest

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't stop this bleeding
Can't stop you leaving
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

[Chorus]
Baby I'm in love with you
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

[Verse 2]
You showed me heaven
You rang a bell
I played with matches
It hurt like hell
Asleep, awake
You're all I see
I can't escape you, can't set you free
I miss your full moon rising
Catching a breath in silence

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't stop this bleeding
Can't stop you leaving
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

[Chorus]
Baby I'm in love with you
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

[Hook]
(Missing you, missing you)
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
(Missing you, missing you)
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby I'm comin, baby I'm comin
Tell me now baby I'll come running
Baby I'm comin, baby I'm comin
Say the word baby I'll come running

[Chorus]
Baby I'm in love with you
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Baby you were mine to lose
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating

[Outro]
Oh, I'm missing the sound, I'm missing the sound of your beating, beating
I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Missing you, missing you
Oh and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Missing you, missing you
Oh, and I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
Beating, beating
Oh, I'm missing the sound of your heart beating
