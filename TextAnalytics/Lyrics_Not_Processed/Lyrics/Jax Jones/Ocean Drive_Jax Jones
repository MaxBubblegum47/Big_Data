[Verse 1: Boy Matthews]
We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding through the dark night, night
With half a tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love, but it's never enough, nah
As the sirens fill the lonely air
Oh, how did we get here now, now, now babe
We see a storm is closing in
Pretending we ain't scared

[Chorus: Boy Matthews]
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (
uh
)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (
uh
)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (
hold on
), hold on (
hold on
)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (
uh
)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (
uh
)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (
hold on
), hold on (
hold on
)

[Verse 2: Boy Matthews]
We're running all the red lights down
No way that we can stop, nah, nah
A quarter tank and almost gone
Pretending we're in love, but it's never enough, nah
I wish we could take it back in time
Before we crossed the line now, now, now, babe
We see a storm is closing in (
oh, oh, oh
)
I reach out for your hand

[Chorus: Boy Matthews]
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (
uh
)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (
uh
)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (
hold on
), hold on (
hold on
), hold on
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (
ooh, yeah
)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (
ooh, ooh
)
We're out of time on the highway to never (
ah, yeah
)
Hold on (
hold on
), hold on (
hold on
), hold on

[Bridge: Boy Matthews]
Ooh
Hold on, oh yeah, oh
Hold on

[Chorus: Boy Matthews]
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (
uh
)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (
oh, uh
)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (
hold on
), hold on (
hold on
), hold on
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (
uh
)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (
uh
)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (
hold on
), hold on (
hold on
), ooh yeah
