[Intro]
The beach is a good place to pick up girls because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are full of chicks
And they’re-and they're-and they're-and they’re-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're
Hm, mm, mm

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, I flashed from the genesis
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends will pretend in the end when you get big
Get slick, get quick, wanna spend shit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can't handle rejection, can’t stand my reflection
Damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind or remind that I’m weak?
Before I'm falling behind every week
I’m too shy when guys get to peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stares to the street, to the gutter, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say “Mother never weep”
My brother finds blood
I say “Shut up 'fore she sees”
Another motherfucking trap
W-wonder when she weeps, w-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth
Spitin' natural disasters
God told me “Cat, don't mess with the past tense”
You’re testing the masses
So guess what the fact is?
My ex is a bachelor
Next, gonna get big checks from the sets
Next, from the dancers
Next, from the models
This Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles (Someone hexed all the bottles)

[Bridge]
I swear on my life, I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh

[Outro]
Better luck next time
Be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-be-be-be—

[Instrumental]
