[Chorus]
Said play with my pussy, but don't play with my emotions (Emotions)
If you spend some money, then maybe I just might fuck ya (Fuck ya)
When I shake that ass, I'ma do that shit in slow motion (Motion)
You got a whole lotta cash, and nigga, you know I want it (Want it)
Play with my pussy, but don't play with my emotions (Emotions, yeah)
If you spend some money, then maybe I just might fuck ya (Fuck ya, yeah, yeah)
When I shake that ass, I'ma do that shit in slow motion (Motion, slow motion, yeah)
You got a whole lotta cash, and nigga, you know I want it (Want it, you know I want it)

[Verse 1]
Break some bread up, nigga, that butter my biscuit (Ha)
You ain't talk money, then really, that's none of my business (That's none of my biz)
I don't even need these lenses (Yeah)
20 on 20 my vision (Woo)
Bad yellow bitch with her eye on the prize
But nigga, I ain't no minion (Yeah, yeah)
Millions, thousands, billions (Trillions)
Bobs on me like Dylan, blondes on me like Hilton
Wendys on me like Williams, shouting, digging
Look at me like I'm alien, bitch, I'm fucking reptilian
Bitch, bitch, aw
All y'all bitches was wrong
Talkin' 'bout I fell off
You ain't even get on
Bitch, bitch, yaw
All y'all bitches is precious
Wait, I meant to say jealous
All y'all bitches is jealous
Bitch, bitch

[Chorus]
Said play with my pussy, but don't play with my emotions (Emotions)
If you spend some money then maybe I just might fuck ya (Fuck ya)
When I shake that ass, I'ma do that shit in slow motion (Motion)
You got a whole lotta cash, and nigga, you know I want it (Want it)
Play with my pussy, but don't play with my emotions (Emotions, yeah)
If you spend some money, then maybe I just might fuck ya (Fuck ya, yeah, yeah)
When I shake that ass, I'ma do that shit in slow motion (Motion, slow motion, yeah)
You got a whole lotta cash, and nigga, you know I want it (Want it, you know I want it)

[Verse 2]
(And now you playin' with my emotions)
Nigga, don't do it, you blew it
You tryna cast spells on a bitch with potions
Nigga, I need devotion
(Leaving you with that lotion)
Telling me this and that, the third
That shit for the birds, I'm ghosting
If you don't dive in that pussy like dolphins
If he don't dive in that pussy like oceans
Twins look identically like Olsens
Nigga, don't hide from the pussy, be open
Nigga wan' spy on the pussy like Austin
(Do I make you horny, baby?)
That's my ego that you stroking
Nigga, don't laugh 'cause the pussy ain't joking
Nigga, go splash when the pussy be soakin' (Yeah)
Where that nigga who don't play mind games at?
You got a fake gold chain on, change that
Tryna spit game while I'm on my way out, late ass
Where that nigga, man? Where he at? Where he at?

[Chorus]
Said play with my pussy, but don't play with my emotions (Emotions)
If you spend some money, then maybe I just might fuck ya (Fuck ya)
When I shake that ass, I'ma do that shit in slow motion (Motion)
You got a whole lotta cash, and nigga, you know I want it (Want it)
Play with my pussy, but don't play with my emotions (Emotions, yeah)
If you spend some money, then maybe I just might fuck ya (Fuck ya, yeah, yeah)
When I shake that ass, I'ma do that shit in slow motion (Motion, slow motion, yeah)
You got a whole lotta cash, and nigga, you know I want it (Want it, you know I want it)
