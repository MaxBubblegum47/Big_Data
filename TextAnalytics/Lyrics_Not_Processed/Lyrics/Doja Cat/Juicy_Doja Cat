Like to keep him wanting more
He ask me, "Doja, where you at, huh?"
And all them niggas wanna know
How long it take to pull my pants up, mmh, mmh, mmh
Broke a fingernail and then some, mmh
Tryna squeeze into my True Religion denim, mmh, mmh, mmh

He spend the racks, he in the trap

Okay, he on his knees, attend the Mass
He beg for that, I bend and snap
She keep it juicy just for papi

My fish like Takamaki, like a side of me with saké
So I put it in my mouth and suck it out like edamame, yeah
Hourglass

We got time and you're right on that
When I turn around and touch it, keep your eyes on that, that, that, that, that, that

Eat that up, and in the night, he see that
In the dark, and in the ride he keep that
Keep it running, like it plump, he need that
Need the rump and need the thighs, he eat that
Eat that up and in the night, he see that
