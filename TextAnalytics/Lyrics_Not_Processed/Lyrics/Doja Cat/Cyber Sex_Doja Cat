[Chorus]
I wanna touch on you (On you)
You see me in my room (My room)
Wish you were here right now (Right now)
All of the things I'd do
I wanna get freaky on camera
I love when we get freaky on camera

[Verse 1]
We freak on the cam
Love at first sight, just a link to the 'Gram
Pussy all pink with a tan
And I play with it 'til my middle fingers are cramped up
Swipe right 'cause he thick and he handsome
Love a sneak peek, when you free? Can we cam up?
No shot to the screen, put your hands up
Make it pop in your face like a Samsung
And that's my nigga, better yet, that's my hitta
He don't leak nudes, and if you do you could go missin'
Met him on Tinder, he just swipe left on bitches
And he don't even scroll through Insta'
'Less he going through my pictures

[Chorus]
I wanna touch on you (On you)
You see me in my room (My room)
Wish you were here right now (Right now)
All of the things I'd do
I wanna get freaky on camera
I love when we get freaky on camera

[Post-Chorus]
Is you into that? (Into that, is you into that? Uh-uh)
Let's break the internet (Internet, on the internet, oh-oh)
We do it the best (It the best, doin' it the best, uh-uh)
When we have cybersex (Cybersex, havin' cybersex, oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
When he off work, he calling me on Skype (Yeah)
Trust me when I meet him, I'm fucking him on sight (Yeah)
Lemme see you beat it, I'm feelin' just like Mike (Okay, okay)
Huh, oh, surf that 'til I drown in all of your pics
Can't scroll down 'cause some of them dicks (Ya)
Think of my parents going through my shit (My shit, my shit)
Huh, oh, can't give head, you give me the FaceTime
Nigga, you a creep, I saw you on Dateline
You ain't gettin' pussy, you fucking an AI
Huh, oh, what a time to be alive
Living in the future, blinging on my hotline

[Chorus]
I wanna touch on you (On you)
You see me in my room (My room)
Wish you were here right now (Right now)
All of the things I'd do
I wanna get freaky on camera
I love when we get freaky on camera
I wanna touch on you (On you)
You see me in my room (My room)
Wish you were here right now (Right now)
All of the things I'd do
I wanna get freaky on camera
I love when we get freaky on camera

[Post-Chorus]
Is you into that? (Into that, is you into that? Uh-uh)
Let's break the internet (Internet, on the internet, oh-oh)
We do it the best (It the best, doin' it the best, uh-uh)
When we have cybersex (Cybersex, havin' cybersex, oh-oh)
