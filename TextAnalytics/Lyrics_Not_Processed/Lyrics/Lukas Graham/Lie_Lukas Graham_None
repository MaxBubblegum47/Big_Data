[Verse 1]
So much for supposed-to-be's
Girl, I wish you luck getting over me
And supposedly
You're with him, but wish you were holding me
You wish you were holding me

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't it, isn't it something
Whenever you touch him
You don't feel nothing?
Isn't it something
How quickly your honesty
Just turns into make-believe?
It turns into make-believe

[Chorus]
Ho-o-o-ow
Dare you li-i-i-ie
To my fa-a-ace?
You can't sa-a-ay
You're fine no-o-o-ow

[Verse 2]
Said you'd never call again
Guess it didn't go how you imagined it
I know what it is (Yeah)
All the time with him, you were wanting this
Yeah, you were wanting this

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't it, isn't it something
How easy you're falling
Like he was nothing?
Isn't it something
How quickly your meant-to-be's (Your meant-to-be's)
Just turned into history?
They turned into history

[Chorus]
Ho-o-o-ow
Dare you li-i-i-ie
To my fa-a-ace?
You can't sa-a-ay
You're fine no-o-o-ow

[Bridge]
You said he was perfect (You said he was perfect)
You said it was working (You said it was working)
You said you were certain (You said you were certain)
Now, why would you lie? (Now, why would you lie?)
It's okay, look into my eyes and let's agree
You've been lying to yourself, not just to me

[Chorus]
Ho-o-o-ow
Dare you li-i-i-ie
To my fa-a-ace?
You can't sa-a-ay
You're fine no-o-o-ow
