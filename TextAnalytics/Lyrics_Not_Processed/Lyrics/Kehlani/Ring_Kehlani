[Intro: Kehlani]
Ooh, ooh
Ring, ring, ring, ring

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can't keep this on the low
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Should I call first? I can't decide
I want to, but a bitch got pride
The switchin' up shit is what I can't fuck with
I'm feelin' you but you hard to get in touch with
And you ain't hit me up in a while
Actin' like you don't know what number to dial
You quit, then that's it, I'ma throw in the towel
'Cause a nigga only gon' do what you allow
You don't want this gun smoke
Learn to text with your nose if your thumb broke
I don't care if we get into it and I stall on your ass
Better still wake up to missed calls from your ass, nigga

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can't keep this on the low
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Nah, nigga, now you gon' have to call me (call me)
'Cause I'm lookin' at these messages, they on me (yeah)
Actin' like they ain't niggas that want me
Let another nigga in your spot, and you gon' be hot, nigga, coffee
You gon' be sick to your, stomach
Hit me when you free, 1-800
It's emergency, call me 911
'Cause right now I'm out here tryna find someone
The ring on my phone, ring on my finger (brrr)
You actin' like you ain't tryna do either (yeah)
Once a good girl, watch me turn diva
Here goes my heart, I put it on speaker (oh)

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring
I can't keep this on the low
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring

[Verse 3: Kehlani]
You used to be on my line
On my tick all the time, yeah
Love it when you make me feel
Like you don't mind when I ain't got time for you
And no it don't go to my head, I'm only arrogant in bed
I just love to know you wanna spend time with me instead
Now you all caught up, yeah
You all caught up and you done left me alone, yeah
You was all fed up
Ready for the next step, wanna be on your own
Said I just miss you, I just miss us, baby
All I know is

[Chorus: Kehlani]
You don't hit my line no more, oh, oh
You don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring (you don't make it ring, baby)
I can't keep this on the low (yeah, yeah, oh)
I want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring
