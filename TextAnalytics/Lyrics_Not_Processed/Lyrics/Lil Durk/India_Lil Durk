[Chorus]
Don't wanna pretend with you
Talking India
I wanna do everything under the sun
I wanna do everything just 1 on 1
Ain't have relationships since 09'
I want this shit right now can't waste time
She so different, she so different
She so different, she so different
She so different, she so different
She so different, she so different

[Verse 1]
I can't lie, I can't tell my guys
That I'm in love and I feel so shy
And we both turnt up we from the Chi
But I don't ask about her other guy
I just wanna eat you alive
Be seen with you just put me in your line
These niggas be hating don't want me in your life
You gon' hear stories about me that shit ain't right
The way you lick your lips
The way you bite 'em
The way you answer your facetime I like 'em
I don't got no hoes no more, I'm show you
When she make me go down low hear my vocals
She just think I'm talking
I can tell by her discussion
She only fuck with bosses
I can tell by her discussions
She fuck my head up
Feel like I got concussion
Them percs I swallow make me want you I'm just honest
I can't lie no more
Late night don't hang out with my guys no more
And you fine ain't gotta be finer no more
I found her ain't gotta find her no more
She found me in the trenches with hella bitches
It started in her DM I had to get it

[Chorus]
Don't wanna pretend with you
Talking India
I wanna do everything under the sun
I wanna do everything just 1 on 1
Ain't have relationships since 09'
I want this shit right now can't waste time
She so different, she so different
She so different, she so different
She so different, she so different
She so different, she so different

[Verse 2]
I wanted you and you knew this shit
Won't brag you with no money cause you used to it
I say I want a wife they say I'm losing it
Before we move too fast we was cooling it
Durkio, I'mma make you scream my name, Durkio
This shit ain't for the fame, Durkio
Too real, too real for games, Durkio
I never been a lame, I just stay in my lane
She can get designer she don't want it
She just wanna stay too plain
I like her she not goofy, she only like real niggas not no goofies
She about her paper, that blue cheese
She tweeted about a nigga and it blew me
I know what I gotta do
I know what I gotta prove
I just know what I gotta get
I know I gotta improve
See I had that young mind young mind
I had a young mind young mind

[Chorus]
Don't wanna pretend with you
Talking India
I wanna do everything under the sun
I wanna do everything just 1 on 1
Ain't have relationships since 09'
I want this shit right now can't waste time
She so different, she so different
She so different, she so different
She so different, she so different
She so different, she so different
