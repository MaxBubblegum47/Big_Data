[Verse-1]
I know I'd go from rages to riches
If you would only say you care
And though my pocket may be empty
I'd be a millionaire

[Hook]
My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything

[Bridge]
So open your arms and you'll open the door
To every treasure I'm hoping for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore

[Chorus]
Must I forever be a begger
Whose golden dreams will not come true
Or will I go from rags to riches
My fate is up to you

[Musical Interlude]

[Chorus]
