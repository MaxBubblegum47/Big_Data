Lady Gaga:
I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream awhile, scheme awhile, youÂ´re sure to find
Happiness and I guess, all those things you've always pined for
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, Tony
With Diamond bracelets Tiffany's doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day you know darn well
Oh I can't give you anything but love
Tony Bennett:
I can't give you anything but love, Lady
That's the only thing I've plenty of, Lady
Dream a while, scheme awhile, you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess, all the things you've always pined for
How'd you like to see me looking swell, Lady
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, Gaga
Duet:
Till that lucky day, you know darn well, Baby
Oh, I can't give you anything
I don't want just anything
Oh, I can't give you anything but love
