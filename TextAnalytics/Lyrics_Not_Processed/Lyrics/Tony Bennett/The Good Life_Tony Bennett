[Intro]
Oh, the good life, full of fun
Seems to be the ideal
Mm, the good life lets you hide
All the sadness you feel

[Verse]
You won't really fall in love
For you can't take the chance
So please be honest with yourself
Don't try to fake romance

[Chorus]
It's the good life to be free
And explore the unknown
Like the heartaches when you learn
You must face them alone

[Bridge]
Please remember, I still want you
And in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up
Kiss the good life, goodbye
