[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Livin' my life with no answers, yeah
Gotta watch out for the cameras
Used to be with all the scammers, yeah
Thirties on thirties, got ammo
You might never understand her, yeah
She want the Fendi, the sandals
She fell in love with the (Woo), yeah
And I fell in love with them angles
She want the Birkin, Birkin
Yeah, Birkin bag, better stay faithful (Woo)
But this ain't that type of love
They only hit me when I'm on the radio
My diamonds, they shine with no flash
I'm never rockin' no typical (Yeah)
Ice on my bitch too
Ice on my daughter, she beautiful
Yeah, runnin' up these M's, I can't let up, I can't
Yeah, play by the rules, I do what I do, I've always been the same
But now, now, now, nowadays, I barely feel the pain
Pop out with the gang, you know we outside, yeah

[Verse 2: Flipp Dinero]
I do the dash while I bend in the coupe (Skrrt)
And I'm droppin' the top just to step up my view (Skrrt, skrrt)
My diamonds hittin', my pointers, they pitchin' (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Got drank out the pint, 'nother round, what it do? (Yeah, yeah)
I fell in love, with no question, it's you
And yes, I fell in love with no diamonds for you (Yeah, yeah)
Cleared all my thoughts, but my vision can't move (Ayy, ayy)
'Cause I'm focused on milli's, like, bitch, what it do? (Ayy, yeah)
I told my mama, "See, I got them racks" (Oh yeah)
Watch how I slide, keep a toolie intact (Oh)
What I do for the guys and I do for respect (Oh yeah)
I can't sip on the Wock' 'cause I'm sippin' on Tech (Yeah)
My mind be trippin', I'm focused on next
Cop me some diamonds, them flawless baguettes
The Bimmer or 'Rari, this shit is a jet
And shawty wan' fuck 'cause she callin' and text
I live my life for today, get them bands and I cash out tomorrow (Oh yeah)
I give my all 'cause your pain is my sorrow (Oh yeah)
Everywhere I go, man, I swear that she follow
I keep my Glock in the whip and it's not on my hip
And I move for the bands, it's the guala (Yeah, oh yeah)
I run it up and I swear it's the commas
My hittas dump when they shoot at the Tahoe, ayy (Yeah)
