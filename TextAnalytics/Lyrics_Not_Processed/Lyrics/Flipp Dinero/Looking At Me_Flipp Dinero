[Intro: Flipp Dinero]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh
And put it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy (NOCAP, put these hoes in a coma)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Flipp Dinero]
Ayy, bottles in the club, different flavors
Mami on my body, ballin' out, can't forsake her
Said she really want me, tell me, "Come out, see you later"
I can't really love her but she know I'm finna take her
I cannot fake her, got hundreds that take her
I can't really want it, but she lost in that paper
But she all up on me, what's the cost? I'ma link her
All these diamonds shinin', what's the cost, bitch? The greatest

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
Yeah, yeah, bottles in the club, why she lookin' at me?
Yeah, uh, yeah (Bottles in the club, why she lookin' at me?)
Said she all in love, why she lookin' at me?
Yeah, uh, yeah (Said she all in love, why she lookin' at me?)
Said she wanna fuck, why she lookin' at me?
Yeah, uh, yeah (Said she wanna fuck, why she lookin' at me?)
Yeah, she know what's up, why she lookin' at me?
Yeah, uh, yeah (Yeah, she know what's up, why she lookin' at me?)

[Verse 2: Flipp Dinero]
Henny make her speed up on the tempo
Fuck with shawty, tryna see what we can get up in to
Sparkles from the bottle make her smile in front of rental
Know that I'ma fuck her, yeah, she love it 'cause I'm simple
Mami with a body, yeah, she pull up, she ease
Keep a blunt that's filled with potent, yeah, the finest, hit the tree
I could tell she really want it 'cause she caught up with a G
I ain't fakin', money-makin', yeah, satisfy her need
I ain't fakin', money-lover, yeah, she do this how she please
Way she holdin' on my arm I say she wanna chill with me
Way she holdin' on my arm you say she all in here with me
If I take her, yeah, she love me 'cause I'm all about my cheese

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]

Yeah, she know what's up, why she lookin' at me?
Yeah, uh, yeah (Yeah, she know what's up, why she lookin' at me?)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Say that's your bitch, why she lookin 'at me?
He ain't no rapper, do shows for the free
She just wanna fuck me for a band, that's cheap
I just made another half a milli' last week
Put it on then I bust all in her asscheeks
Make her cum all on the bed, she need new sheets
I'ma beat the pussy up like Bruce Lee
I'ma let her come on over, but she can't sleep
You thought you had a good girl, make her nasty
She a freak on the weekend but she classy
I'ma give her the D and she lookin' at me
Give it up easy like A-B-C

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
Yeah, yeah, bottles in the club, why she lookin' at me?
Yeah, uh, yeah (Bottles in the club, why she lookin' at me?)
Said she all in love, why she lookin' at me?
Yeah, uh, yeah (Said she all in love, why she lookin' at me?)
Said she wanna fuck, why she lookin' at me?
Yeah, uh, yeah (Said she wanna fuck, why she lookin' at me?)
Yeah, she know what's up, why she lookin' at me?
Yeah, uh, yeah (Yeah, she know what's up, why she lookin' at me?)
Yeah, bottles in the club, why she lookin' at me?
Yeah, uh, yeah (Bottles in the club, why she lookin' at me?)
Said she all in love, why she lookin' at me?
