[Intro: Flipp Dinero]
Yeah, yeah
I'm just kinda caught up wit' myself (yeah)
Livin' 'til my time goes down like it's supposed to
I can't really trust nobody else (yeah)
Either way my time goes down like it's supposed to

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it

[Verse 1: Flipp Dinero]
I, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whip the foreign like a drive by, Nina sitting with me that's for nine lives
I ain't really with the Allahs, pray to God to bless and judge our lives
Teachin' niggas 'til their so fine, nigga see what I mean, yeah it's all mine
And niggas searchin' 'til they all find, niggas see you doin' good, it's all fine
And niggas fakin', yeah that's all time, bitches front and fakin', that's a small line
See I can trust us all, no, see I just want this dub, yeah
See I can't love these hoes, yeah, I stack it up and go, yeah
I wanna look wild when I flex it, get diamonds all up in my necklace
Got foreign all on my like Tetris, get mama the crib she requested
Niggas hatin' that's their occupation, they can't stand to see another nigga make it
This shit here like history in the makin', this a fuckin' [?] so I'ma fuckin' take it like

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Money always on my line, yeah, and I answer all the time (hey)
Bitches always on my line, but not important so I decline

[?] got imported, you know that it's foreign, ass over M on the A (ay)
Lookin' at billboards hopin' that nigga [?] to see him on there, ay (ay)
Diamonds so wet you could swim on 'em, I'll shoot it out like Shawn Kemp on 'em
They like that boy keep that bitch on him, that's why he walk with that limp on him
Fuck round a whole extra clip on 'em, walk in your block, shoot it up and just dip on 'em
Rollin' backwoods poppin' Yerkys, I used to pour up the lean like I'm Pimp on 'em (pow)
Devil want these streets to hurt me, but I can't fold 'cause Lord give me strength on 'em (the Lord gave me strength on 'em)

[?] at 7-Eleven, I just got back from LA on the [?] ([?] on 'em)
My Glock is .357, back of that new '63 with the tint on it (ay)
Might pull in the [?] on 'em (ay), if you talkin' money, I'ma spend on 'em

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it
