[Intro: Dominic Fike]
Ayy, she met me, let me fuck in the shower
I wrote my number in the mist on the mirror
I'm not the type to tell my homies about ya
You're not the type to hold me down through the year

[Chorus: Dominic Fike]
I'll be your baby doll and your bodyguard if you tell me to
I'll try to make it all not as hard if you let me through

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I ain't sign up for no bullshit
I told my baby that I'm bulletproof
Hands made me take two sips
All things I couldn't do
The cops come, then we dip, baby
Back when we was just friends, baby
Shit, man, you was just a baby
And I turned on you like Mother Nature
Try to think about the blueprint
All the shit that you told me not to do
Was breaking it worth it in the end
If I'm just a vision you come to?

[Pre-Chorus: Joba, & 
bearface
]
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right

[Chorus: Dominic Fike]
I'll be your baby doll and your bodyguard if you tell me to
I'll try to make it all not as hard if you let me through

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I ain't tryna get the roof bent
Back then when I would ride with you
Short trips doing backflips
Mesmerized me, led me to the truth
Atlanta, we was kids, baby
Special moments with my friends, baby
Sippin' on some fuckin' gin, baby
And you wonder why we ain't win, baby
This year I ain't takin' no pics
I'm tryna get with the motion
I'm tryna get a promotion
Window shoppin' 'til they closin'

[Pre-Chorus: Joba, & 
bearface
]
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right

[Chorus: Dominic Fike]
I'll be your baby doll and your bodyguard if you tell me to
I'll try to make it all not as hard if you let me through

[Outro: Joba & 
bearface
]
It's all peaches and cream
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right
If you left your love I'll be right
