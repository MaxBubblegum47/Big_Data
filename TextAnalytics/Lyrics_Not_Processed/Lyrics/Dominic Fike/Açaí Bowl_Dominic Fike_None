[Chorus]
She said, '’I dressed in your favorite
I bought two bottles of red
Unless you made reservations
Oh look, you thought all ahead''

[Verse 1]
Takin’ up all the space beside ya
And you took a day out of your work life
Said you'll find a way to make it work right
She said, ''Take off your clothes, don't cool your jets''
Straight across the globe, propel me, ahh
Love it when you bite, bite

[Chorus]
She said '’I dressed in your favorite
I bought two bottles of red
Unless you made reservations
Oh look, you thought all ahead’'

[Bridge]
All of your clothes are bound, they’re physical
Articles float around my living room
Mix up your soul with mine tonight
Tangle your legs up in my bed

[Verse 2]
I remember waking up with shawty on the couch
I had no money (Mhm, mhm)
And now we both wake up, she takes my card like, "Is it sweet?"
I say, "Go, honey" (Mhm, mhm)
And when they locked me up, she never listened to her friend
They told her, "Move on" movin' on (Mhm)
And now she tells that same bitch, ''My shoes Prada
My boo bought ’em, I do love him''
You know them bitches mad as fuck
I let my smile show 'til these bitches had enough
She let her mind roam 'cause she know I got it covered
And that's simple enough, I guess

[Chorus]
She said, ''I dressed in your favorite
I bought two bottles of red
Unless you made reservations
Oh look, you thought all ahead, yeah''
