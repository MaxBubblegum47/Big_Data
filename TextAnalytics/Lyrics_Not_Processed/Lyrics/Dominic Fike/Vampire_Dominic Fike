[Chorus]
I only showed up to tell you (Ooh)
Everyone at this party's a vampire (Ooh, ooh)
This ain’t red wine (Ooh)
We're all food for the bloodsuckers (Ooh)
Movin' up under the moonlight (Ooh, ooh)
Like the vampires (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Baby, careful inside where you step
Can you feel the weight of their eyes on your neck?
Passin’ you on the way down descendin' the stairs
And the whole room is watchin' while pretendin' to dance
It was close 'cause you don't know if you're standin' a chance
On your own, right, I know you didn’t make any plans
And when the clock strikes twelve at night
You be doin’ hella white
With somebody you don't even like, talkin’ 'bout your life
One, two

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we dead? Is this really red wine?
Were you feeling left out? Ah, yeah, uh
Take me back when I'm feelin' stressed out
’Cause it's nearing that time

[Chorus]
I only showed up to tell you (Ooh)
Everyone at this party's a vampire (Ooh, ooh)
This ain't red wine (Ooh)
We're all food for the bloodsuckers (Ooh)
Movin' up under the moonlight (Ooh, ooh)
Like the vampires (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
They can tell that your mind is a mess (Mind is a mess)
Take someone you don't even like to your bed
When it's over, you roll out
You come down the stairs and there's no sound
The party vanished into thin air, just like a ghost town
Your best friends weren't even there
And then the whole time, you realized you don't even care
When that alarm strikes seven, light pourin' on your feather-white
Bed of white lies, last night was a set up
One, two

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we dead? Is this really red wine?
Were you feeling left out? Ah, yeah, uh
Take me back when I'm feelin' stressed out
'Cause it's nearing that time

[Chorus]
I only showed up to tell you (Ooh)
Everyone at this party's a vampire (Ooh, ooh)
This ain't red wine (Ooh)
We're all food for the bloodsuckers (Ooh)
Movin' up under the moonlight (Ooh, ooh)
Like the vampires (Ooh)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
