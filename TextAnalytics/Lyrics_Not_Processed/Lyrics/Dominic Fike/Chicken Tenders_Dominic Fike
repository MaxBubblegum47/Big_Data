[Chorus]
Chicken tenders in my hotel, yeah
Christina's in my bed watchin' TV shows
When she hit the remote with her legs shakin', that's good love makin'
Watchin' wherever my head facin', it's for bugs, baby

[Post-Chorus]
White wings in my pillows and blankets (Lovin' under covers)
I got markings on my body from tracin' (All over my body, girl)
Rodeo for Cartier glasses
But, girl, you know how itchy my back get (Woah)

[Verse 1]
Every time (Every time)
We settle, but it never felt right 'cause we can't keep still
And we try to fight the way everything feels
When we step out of line
I met your gaze and it was love that we were makin' it
And she spoke a different language
There was no need for translation
And I ordered chicken fingers to my room, girl
But we got some things to do first

[Chorus]
Chicken tenders in my hotel, yeah
Christina's in my bed watchin' TV shows
When she hit the remote with her legs shakin', that's good love makin'
Watchin' wherever my head facin', it's for bugs, baby

[Post-Chorus]
White wings in my pillows and blankets (Lovin' under covers)
I got markings on my body from tracin' (All over my body, girl)
Rodeo for Cartier glasses
But, girl, you know how itchy my back get (All over my body, girl)

[Verse 2]
Every night (Every night, she calls)
You call me for whatever feels right
Baby, don't stay still, make your mind
You could be wakin' up in here for the rest of your life
And I knew just what she was thinkin'
With no need for speculation
Just your body and a blanket
And I hope this doesn't change it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the best part of my day is (Oh)
When I get to see you naked

[Chorus]
Chicken tenders in my hotel, yeah
Christina's in my bed watchin' TV shows
When she hit the remote with her legs shakin', that's good love makin'
Watchin' wherever my head facin', it's for bugs, baby

[Post-Chorus]
White wings in my pillows and blankets (Lovin' under covers)
I got markings on my body from tracin' (All over my body, girl)
Rodeo for Cartier glasses (
Oh, oh, oh
)
But, girl, you know how itchy my back get
