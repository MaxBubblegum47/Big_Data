[Chorus]
I can't move on, babydoll
Waitin' on calls, flippin' through stations
I'm outclassed and it's outrageous
And I'll take it all, babydoll
Whatever's been weighing you down

[Verse]
Find me on Miami concrete
Lookin' for somebody different 'cause my daddy was a pimp
My mama had her issues but I miss her anyway
Oh, babydoll
Please don't call me for the wrong reasons
We both know exactly what I'm thinkin'
Weeks pass and I never grow tired
'Cause I never said never and I barely ever lie
I'm on the road to an original place in outer space
I didn't make it up, but you can't find it on a phone or a globe
And I can take you with me if you really wanna go
Oh, babydoll, I can't move on

[Chorus]
I can't move on, babydoll
Waitin' on calls, flippin' through stations
I'm outclassed and it's outrageous
And I'll take it all, babydoll
Whatever's been weighing you down
