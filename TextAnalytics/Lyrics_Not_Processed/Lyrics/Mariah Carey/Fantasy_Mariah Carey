[Verse 1]
Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind

[Chorus]
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
(And I want you so bad)

[Verse 2]
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

[Chorus]
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
Oh, oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)

[Bridge]
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

[Chorus]
Oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
