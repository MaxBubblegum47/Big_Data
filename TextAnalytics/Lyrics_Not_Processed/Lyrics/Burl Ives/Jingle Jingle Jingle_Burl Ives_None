Jingle, jingle, jingle
You will hear my sleigh bells ring
I am old Kris Kringle
I'm the King of Jingling

Jingle, jingle, reindeer
Through the frosty air they go
They are not just plain deer
They're the fastest deer I know (Ho! Ho!)

You must believe that on Christmas Eve
I won't pass you by
I'll dash away in my magic sleigh
Flying through the sky

Jingle, jingle, jingle
You will hear my sleigh bells ring
I am old Kris Kringle
I'm the King of Jingling (Ho! Ho!) For Thy mercy and Thy grace
Constant through another year
Hear our song of thankfulness
Father and Redeemer hear

Dark the future; let Thy light
Guide us, bright and morning star
Fierce our foes and hard the fight
Arm us Savior for the war

In our weakness and distress
Rock of strength be Thou our stay
In the pathless wilderness
Be our true and living way

Keep us faithful; keep us pure
Keep us evermore Thine own
Help, O help us to endure
Fit us for the promised crown
