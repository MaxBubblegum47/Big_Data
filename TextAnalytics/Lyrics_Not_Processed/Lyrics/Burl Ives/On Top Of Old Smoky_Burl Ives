5. ON TOP OF OLD SMOKY
On top of old smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
From courting too slow
For courting's a pleasure
And parting's a grief
And a false hearted lover
Is worse than a thief
For a thief will just rob you
And take all you save
But a false hearted lover
Will lead you to the grave
And the grave will decay
You and turn you to dust
Not one girl in fifty
A poor boy can trust
They'll hug you and kiss you
And tell you more lies
Than cross lines on a railroad
Or stars in the skies
So come all your maidens
And listen to me
Never place your affections
On a green willow tree
For the leaves they will wither
And the roots they will die
You'll all be forsaken
And never know why
