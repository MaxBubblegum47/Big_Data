I've reached the land of corn and wine
And all it riches freely mine
Now shines undimmed the blistful day
But all my sins are cast away
Oh, Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land
As on the highest mount I stand
I look away across the sea
Where mansions are prepared for me
And view the shining glory shore
My Heav?n, my home forever more!
The Savior comes and walks with me
And sweet communion here have we
He gently leads me with His hand
For this is Heaven?s table land
Oh, Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land
As on the highest mount I stand
I look away across the sea
Where mansions are prepared for me
And view the shining glory shore
My Heav?n, my home forever more!
The zephyrs seem to float to me
Sweet sounds of Heaven?s melody
And angels with the white robed throng
Join in the sweet redemption song
Oh, Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land
As on the highest mount I stand
I look away across the sea
Where mansions are prepared for me
And view the shining glory shore
My Heav?n, my home forever more!

(optional 3rd verse and refrain
Omitted by Burl Ives)
A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from ever vernal trees
And flow?rs, that never fading grow
Where streams of life forever flow
Oh, Beulah Land, Beulah Land
As on the highest mount I stand
I look away across the sea
Where mansions are prepared for me
And view the shining glory shore
My Heav?n, my home forever more!
