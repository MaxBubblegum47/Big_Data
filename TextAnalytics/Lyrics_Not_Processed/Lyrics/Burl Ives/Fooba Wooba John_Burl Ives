Saw a flea kick a tree
Fooba wooba, fooba wooba
Saw a flea kick a tree
Fooba wooba John
Saw a flea kick a tree
In the middle of the sea
Well, John, ho, John
Fooba wooba John
Saw a rat chase a cat
Fooba wooba, fooba wooba
Saw a rat chase a cat
Fooba wooba John
Saw a rat chase a cat
Heard the cat say, "Please bat, scat!"
Ho John, oh John
Fooba wooba John
Saw a bear comb his hair
Fooba wooba, fooba wooba
Saw a bear comb his hair
Fooba wooba John
Saw a bear comb his hair
In the middle of the hair
Ho, John, ho, John
Fooba wooba John
