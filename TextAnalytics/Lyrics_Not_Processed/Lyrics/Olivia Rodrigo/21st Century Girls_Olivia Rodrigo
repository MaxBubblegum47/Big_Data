Long blonde hair, daddy's a millionaire
Nobody knows her, but everybody wants to
That's what I see

Europe trips
Kissing the dream boy's lips
Successful with a smile
She's everything that I'll
Never be

Twenty-first century girls
Are perfect
And I know it isn't real, it's all so stupid
But digital love it still feels real to me
She looks like an angel it's what they'll believe

Twenty-first century girls
Are flawless
And I say I didn't care, but if I am honest
It's hard not to feel like I'm never enough
Yeah, I want that twenty-first century love
