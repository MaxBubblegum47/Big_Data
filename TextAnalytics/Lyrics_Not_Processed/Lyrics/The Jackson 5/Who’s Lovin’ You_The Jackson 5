[Verse 1]
When I (when I) had you (had you)
I treated you bad
And wrong, my dear
And girl since
Since you went away

[Hook]
Don't you know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

[Verse 2]
I, I, I, I
Should have never ever
Ever made you cry
And girl since
Since you been gone

[Hook]
Don't you know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

[Bridge]
Life without love
Is oh, so lonely
I don't think
I don't think
I'm gonna make it
All my life (all my life)
All my life, yeah (all my life)
Belongs to you only
Come on and take it, girl
Come on and take it
Because

{Verse 3}
All
All I can do
All I can do
Since you've been gone is cry
And you, oooh
Will never wonder
And worry your pretty little head
About what I do

[Hook]
Don't you know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you
