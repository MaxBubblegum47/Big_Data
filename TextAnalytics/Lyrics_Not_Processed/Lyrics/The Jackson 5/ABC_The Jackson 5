[Intro: Michael Jackson]
A buh-buh buh buh
A buh-buh buh buh

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson & 
Jermaine Jackson
]
You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before
Like "I before E, except after C"
And why two plus two makes four
Now now now, I'm gonna teach you (
Teach you, teach you
)
All about love, yeah! (
All about love!
)
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as Do-Re-Mi
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, baby you and me, girl!
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as Do-Re-Mi
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, baby you and me, girl!

[Bridge: Tito Jackson, 
Jackie Jackson
, 
Jermaine Jackson
 & 
Michael Jackson
]
Come on, let me love you just a little bit!
Come on, let me love you just a little bit!
I'ma gonna teach how to sing it out!
Come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about!

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson & 
Jermaine Jackson
]
Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, girl
Your education ain't complete
T-t-t-teachers gonna show you (
Show you, show you
)
How to get an "A"! (
Nyah nyah nyah nyah!
)
Spell me, you
 (
You add the two
)
Listen to me baby, that's all you gotta do!

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
A, B, C
It's easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as Do-Re-Mi
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, baby you and me, girl!

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
A, B, C, it's easy, it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
Now, that's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody
1, 2, 3, you and me (
Yeah
)

[Bridge 1: Michael Jackson]
Sit down, girl!
I think I love you!
No!
Get up, girl!
Show me what you can do!
Shake it, shake it, baby, come on now!
Shake it, shake it, baby, ooh-ooh!
Shake it, shake it, baby, huh!
1, 2, 3, baby, ooh-ooh
A, B, C, baby, nah nah!
Do-Re-Mi, baby, huh!
That's how easy love can be

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
A, B, C, it's easy, it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be

[Outro: Jermaine Jackson & 
Michael Jackson
]
I'm-a gonna teach you how to sing it out!
Come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about!
A, B, C, it's easy, it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
I'ma gonna teach you how to sing it out, sing it out, sing it out! (
Oh! Oh! Oh, baby!
)
A, B, C, it's easy, it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy...
