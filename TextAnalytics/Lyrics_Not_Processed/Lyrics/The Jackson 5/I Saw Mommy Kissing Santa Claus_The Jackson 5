[Spoken Intro]
Merry Christmas and a happy new year
This is Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5 wishing a happy holiday to all mountain fans

[Intro]
Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!

[Verse 1]
I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus (kissing, kissing, Santa Claus)
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom, fast asleep

[Chorus]
Then I saw mommy tickle, tickle (tickle, tickle, Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

[Bridge]
He saw mommy kissing (kissing, kissing, Santa Claus)
I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad

[Verse 2]
Then I saw mommy tickle (tickle, tickle, Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

[Bridge]
I did! I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
You gotta believe me! You just gotta believe me!
Come on, fellas, believe me!
You just gotta believe me! (I told you, I told you)
