[Verse 1]
I'd put the whiskey back in the bottle
Put the smoke back in the joint
Look up at the sky and say
"Okay, okay, okay, think you made your point"
I'd cover up the pool at Skymont
I'd take some girls out of my phone
Give the nightlife back to Nashville
One night at a time 'til all the regret's gone

[Chorus]
And I'd drive a thousand miles to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies could still come true
I'd tell you everything was alright
And hold you, baby, all night
When your heart was all patched up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And give it back to you

[Verse 2]
I thought I wanted my freedom
I told myself I'd have a ball
But it turns out going out and chasing
Dreams and lonely women
Ain't freedom after all
If I could go back now
And take it back somehow

[Chorus]
I'd drive a thousand miles to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies could still come true
I'd tell you everything was alright
I'd hold you, baby, all night
When your heart was all fixed up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And give it back to you

[Bridge]
If I could wrangle all my sins
Take 'em back and make amends
And do it all over again
I'd take the wrongs and make 'em right
All the lonesome, lonely nights
Pack 'em up and haul 'em all back home to you

[Chorus]
And I'd drive a thousand miles to your house
Walk in like I walked out
Put the tears back in your eyes
'Cause all my lies could still come true
I'd tell you everything was alright
I'd hold you, baby, all night
When your heart was all patched up
And our love was good as new
I'd take 2016
And all the lonely nights in between
And give 'em back to you
Give it all back to you
