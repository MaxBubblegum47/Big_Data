[Verse 1]
(I saw you going by)
I saw you going by, I had to say hello
And I don't mean to pry, but girl, I gotta know
What is your name?
How come I ain't seen you around before? (Tell me)
You know I ain't ever had a type, having a type takes two
But I know what I like, and you're the only one of you
You're something else (Damn)
And I know we just met, but

[Chorus]
I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

[Verse 2]
(I wanna take you home)
I wanna take you home, not just take you home tonight
Get Joanie on the phone, she'll leave us on a light
I wanna see the way you look up under all those stars, yeah
You're gonna be the talk, word's gonna get around
They'll tell you how they thought I'd never settle down
Out on the porch, ain't it funny the way things change?

[Chorus]
I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

[Bridge]
I don't wanna wait around for the right time

[Chorus]
I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

[Outro]
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks
Woah
