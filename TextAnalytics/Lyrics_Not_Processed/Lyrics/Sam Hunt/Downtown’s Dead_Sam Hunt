[Intro]
Thanks, Hannah, thanks for coming back

[Verse 1]
The city's so in style
All you see for miles are people spilling in and out of cars
Man, all of these bars are making a killin'
Everywhere I go looks like the place to be
I see people that I know, but I feel like there's no one here but me

[Chorus]
Downtown's dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say hi
But Friday night, it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you're still in my head
There ain't no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown's dead, downtown's dead, yeah

[Verse 2]
They're dancing in the strobes
Out here in the throes of loud house music
Everything's a blur
I don't hear the words, but lips are moving
Tried to get involved, but I've 'bout had enough
People wall to the wall
And I'm just holdin' it up 'cause

[Chorus]
Downtown's dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say hi
But Friday night, it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you're still in my head
There ain't no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown's dead, downtown's dead

[Bridge]
Free drinks, bright lights
What am I doing with my life?
Okay, I quit, I've had enough of this
'Cause people are losing their minds
Can't get you out of my head
I'm calling it a night
I'm crawling back to your bed

[Chorus]
Downtown's dead without you
Girls walk by and friends say hi
But Friday night, it might as well be just another
Tuesday night without you
As long as you're still in my head
There ain't no way that I can paint a ghost town red
Downtown's dead, downtown's dead

[Outro]
Downtown's dead
