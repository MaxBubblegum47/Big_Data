[Intro]
Pour a drink and take a sip of it
Feelin' like a hypocrite
Couple more and I won't give a shit
I never used to talk, I never used to talk like this

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry I named the album Montevallo
And I'm sorry people know your name now
And strangers hit you up on social media
I'm sorry you can't listen to the radio
And drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in Pelham
I know you want your privacy
And you got nothing to say to me
But I wish you'd let me pay off your student loans
With these songs you gave to me
'Member the first time you stayed with me?
Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMAs with me?
Two years later, it felt like you were a million miles away from me
And I was the one on stage, drunk, barely holdin' on on ABC
Hope your dad still prays for me

[Chorus]
Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, goin' down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm goin' down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around

[Verse 2]
A year ago, I was in a hotel room in Phoenix
Wonderin' if it's ever okay to lie
'Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die
But I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life
But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye
Every night, you'd fill the bathtub up
Lie there for hours, put your face under water and cry
I never wanted to be a heartbreaker
Turn your sisters and their friends into matchmakers
I know you think my dreams came true
Since you been gone, singin' these songs are just something to do
The only dream I ever had was you
I hope you know I'm still in love
It's the kind that you can't fall out of

[Chorus]
Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, goin' down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm goin' down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
(Now it's almost gone)

[Verse 3]
I know this might seem like a contradiction
And the last thing you need is more unwanted attention
But you changed your number and moved
And this is the only way I could reach you
So wherever you are, turn it up and listen

[Outro]
Hannah Lee, I'm on my way to you
Nobody can love you like I do
I don't know what I'm gon' say to you
But I know there ain't no way, know there ain't no way
Know there ain't no way we're through
