[Verse 1]
Take me, take me, take me to your paradise, I'll follow
You've got me going crazy for you, got me going crazy for you
I will echo every word you say about tomorrow
Even when I can't see what you
Even when I can't see what you do

[Chorus]
Damn you got me, got me speechless, speechless
You got me hooked on your fingertips, baby
Every time the pressure gets to me
You got me hooked 'cause damn, you got me speechless
Oh you got me on the edge of tonight with you
You got me, got me
I told you once that I would never think twice
Cause I know you got me, got me

[Verse 2]
With you, I'll go even if it's not my aspiration
I think about you only, only, think about you only, only
They say that you're toxic and you're flowing through my bloodstream
But I don't care what they say, I say we are in our own world anyway

[Chorus]
Damn you got me, got me speechless, speechless
You got me hooked on your fingertips, baby
Every time the pressure gets to me
You got me hooked 'cause damn you got me speechless
Oh, you got me on the edge of tonight with you
You got me, got me
I told you once that I would never think twice
'Cause I know you got me, got me

[Bridge]
Slowly sinking to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh I won't let go
Caught me falling for the way you pull me closer, don't let me go

[Chorus]
Oh, you got me on the edge of tonight with you
You got me, got me
I told you once that I would never think twice
'Cause I know you got me, got me
You got me, got me
You got me, got me
