[Verse 1]
I had one saying we were done
In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out of nowhere
Man, I took that one pretty hard (That one pretty hard)
And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

[Chorus]
So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the "hey, I think we need to talk"
And the "it ain't me, it's you" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

[Verse 2]
Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason

[Chorus]
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the "hey, I think we need to talk"
And the "it ain't me, it's you" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Yeah, the almost maybes)

[Bridge]
Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons
From the didn't work outs
The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes

[Chorus]
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the "hey, I think we need to talk"
And the "it ain't me, it's you" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Almost maybes)

[Outro]
No, it wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes
