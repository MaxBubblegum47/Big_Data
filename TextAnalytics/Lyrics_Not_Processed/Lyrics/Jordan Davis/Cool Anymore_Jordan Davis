[Verse 1: Jordan Davis]
So hold your head up, work the room
Smile like you ain't nervous (Nervous)
And be the life of every party with all your friends (Your friends)
Laugh it off, roll your eyes when they tell you that you're perfect
You can be that with all of them

[Chorus: Jordan Davis]
But you don't have to be cool anymore
Show me the side that nobody else knows
Drop that act with your keys at the door
Lose the mirrors, I see through the smoke (The smoke)
Save all that for the rest of the world
Come on, let me love you, girl
Don't you know that I'm already yours? (Already yours)
You don't have to be cool anymore
Cool anymore

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
Puff your chest, crack a drink with your boys like you like to (Mmm)
And you internalize everything that's wrong, yeah (Uh)
But I know you when I know when we go home
You're slow dancin' in the kitchen with me all night long
I know you when I know when we're alone
You'll hold me better up, better than anyone

[Chorus: Jordan Davis & Julia Michaels]
You don't have to be cool anymore
Show me the side that nobody else knows
Drop that act with your keys at the door
Lose the mirrors, I see through the smoke
Save all that for the rest of the world
Come on, let me love you, girl
And don't you know that I'm already yours?
You don't have to be cool anymore
Cool anymore

[Bridge: Jordan Davis 
with Julia Michaels
]
You can be anything to anyone
When the curtains close and the day is done
It's just us in the dark, baby, just be who you are

[Chorus: Jordan Davis & Julia Michaels, 
Julia Michaels
]
You don't have to be cool anymore
Show me the side that nobody else knows
Drop that act with your keys at the door
Lose the mirrors, I see through the smoke 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Save all that for the rest of the world
Come on, let me love you, girl
Don't you know that I'm already yours? 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You don't have to be cool anymore
Cool anymore

[Outro: Jordan Davis & 
Julia Michaels

Both
]
You don't gotta be, don't gotta be
Cool anymore 
(Oh)
Cool anymore
You don't gotta be,
 don't gotta be, don't gotta be 
(Cool, cool)
Cool anymore
You don't gotta be, yeah, yeah
Cool anymore
