[Verse 1]
Baby, donâ€™t make me spell it out for you
All of the feelings that I've got for you
Can't be explained, but I can try for you
Yeah, baby, don't make me spell it out for you
You keep on asking me the same questions (why?)
And second-guessing all my intentions
Should know by the way I use my compression
That you've got the answers to my confessions

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I'm powerful with a little bit of tender
An emotional sexual bender
Mess me up, yeah, but no one does it better
There's nothin' better

[Chorus]
That's just the way you make me feel
(
That's just the way you make me feel
)
That's just the way you make me feel
(
That's just the way you make me feel
)
So good, so good, so fuckin' real
(
So good, so good, so fuckin' real
)
That's just the way you make me feel
(
That's just the way you make me feel
)
That's just the way you make me feel

[Verse 2]
You know I love it, so please don't stop it
You got me right here in your jean pocket (right now)
Laying your body on a shag carpet (oh)
You know I love it so please don't stop it

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I'm powerful with a little bit of tender
An emotional sexual bender
Mess me up, yeah, but no one does it better
There's nothin' better

[Chorus]
That's just the way you make me feel
(
That's just the way you make me feel
)
That's just the way you make me feel
(
That's just the way you make me feel
)
So good, so good, so fuckin' real
(
So good, so good, so fuckin' real
)
That's just the way you make me feel
(
That's just the way you make me feel
)
That's just the way you make me feel

[Bridge]
That's just the way that I feel now, baby
Good God! I can't help it! Agh!
Hey! That's just the way that I feel, yeah
Please! I can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I'm powerful with a little bit of tender
An emotional, sexual bender
Mess me up, yeah, but no one does it better (oh!)
There's nothin' better (better!)
(Damn)

[Chorus]
That's just the way you make me feel
(
That's just the way you make me feel
)
That's just the way you make me feel
(
That's just the way you make me feel
)
So good, so good, so fuckin' real
(
So good, so good, so fuckin' real
)
That's just the way you make me feel
(
That's just the way you make me feel
)
That's just the way you make me feel
