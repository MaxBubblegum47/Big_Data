[Verse 1: Zyra]
I heard the news today
That you're not mine to keep
Don't struggle too much now
While I kill you in your sleep
What is lust if it's not being by yourself?
I won't be gentle to the body on the shelf

[Hook: Zyra]
It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love
It's only slaughter
We're only liars
It's only blood
They're only thoughts that
I'm having stored safe within my head
You're only crying
You're only dying
You're only late

[Verse 2: Zyra]
I heard the news today
That you weren't mine to save
I hope that you're comfortable
In the quiet plastic grave
What is lust if it's not being by yourself?
I won't be gentle to the body on the shelf

[Hook with variation: Zyra]
It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love
It's only slaughter
We're only liars
It's only blood
They're only thoughts that
I'm having stored safe within my head
You're only crying
You're only dying
You're only dead

[Bridge: Zyra]
It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love
It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love
It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love
It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love

[Hook with variation: Zyra]
It's only water
It's only fire
It's only love
It's only slaughter
We're only liars
It's only blood
They're only thoughts that
I'm having stored safe within my head
You're only crying
You're only dying
We're only dead
