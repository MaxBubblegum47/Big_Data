[Verse 1]
Ever feel like you can’t breathe?
Does the water feel too deep?
Lie awake 'cause you can’t sleep without it
Ever feel like you’re alone?
When you’re lost but you're already home?
Lie awake 'cause you can’t dream without it

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s gonna be alright
Never gonna leave your side
It’s gonna be alright, -ight

[Chorus]
Everybody falls down, all the way down
You've just gotta hold on tight
You gotta get up, gotta get up
We're gonna make it through this time
Everybody falls down, all the way down
You've just gotta hold on tight
You gotta get up, gotta get up
We're gonna make it through this time

[Verse 2]
Ever feel like it’s too much?
Do you feel like you’re not enough
When you feel like it's gonna take forever?
Yeah, I swear I know what it's like
To feel alone at the end of the night
Maybe you don’t know it, but it gets better

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s gonna be alright
Never gonna leave your side
It’s gonna be alright, -ight

[Chorus]
Everybody falls down, all the way down
You've just gotta hold on tight
You gotta get up, gotta get up
We're gonna make it through this time
Everybody falls down, all the way down
You've just gotta hold on tight
You gotta get up, gotta get up
We're gonna make it through this time

[Chorus]
Everybody falls down, all the way down
You've just gotta hold on tight
You gotta get up, gotta get up
We're gonna make it through this time
Everybody falls down, all the way down
You just gotta hold on tight
You gotta get up, gotta get up
Gonna make it through this time

[Post-Chorus]
Time, time
We're gonna make it through this time
Time, time
We're gonna make it through this time
Time, time
We're gonna make it through this time
Time, time
We're gonna make it through this time
