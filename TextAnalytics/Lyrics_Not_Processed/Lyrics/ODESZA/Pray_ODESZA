[Verse 1: JRY]
I've been playing with my demons
Making troubles for yourself
And these days are far from over
You know I can't help myself
I love coming for you baby
And it's killing me inside
I've been dying for you baby
Almost every single night

[Pre-Chorus: JRY]
Forget the words I'm saying
I know that I've been cruel
I pray for peace
Tell me why don't you

[Chorus: Rooty]
Oh I pray
I know that I've been cruel
Oh I pray
I know that what I do

[Verse 2: JRY]
I've been losing my religion
Making trouble for myself
And these nights are getting longer
You know I just need your help
I keep running for you baby
And it's eating me alive
I'll be dying for you baby
'Till you'll bring me back to life

[Pre-Chorus: JRY]
Forget the words I'm saying
I know that I've been cruel
I pray for peace
Tell me why don't you

[Chorus: Rooty]
Oh I pray
I know that I've been cruel
Oh I pray
I know that what I do

[Bridge: JRY]
I, wanna throw it all away
For tonight, and 
the day
 another day
It's just you and me
And I'm on my knees
Would you pray for me
Would you pray pray pray pray

[Chorus: Rooty]
Oh I pray
I know that I've been cruel
Oh I pray
I know that what I do
