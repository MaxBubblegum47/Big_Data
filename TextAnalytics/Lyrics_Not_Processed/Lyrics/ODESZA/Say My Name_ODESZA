[Verse 1]
I wanna go, so, what'd you say
When you gonna let me know
If you give a damn about me?
'Cause you got my hands tied
In my defense, I always fall for confidence
And your compliments look good on me

[Pre-Hook]
'Cause nobody knows it better
Than the girl in the corner
With the Scarlet Letter
And while you're watching
You may think that she doesn't matter
But no one knows you better

[Hook]
Oh yeah
I wanna dance
I wanna dance, dance, dance with you- you
So, take a chance
So, take a chance
Oh yeah
I wanna dance
I wanna dance, dance, dance with you- you
So, take a chance
So, take a chance
Oh yeah

[Post-Hook]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
I need a sign or a signal
I've overthought everything I can think of into symbol
I need the coat and your jacket
And the remnants of your cigarette packet

[Verse 2]
I wanna go, so, what'd you say
When you gonna let me know
If you give a damn about me?
'Cause you got my hands tied
In my defense, I always fall for confidence
And your compliments look good on me

[Pre-Hook]
'Cause nobody knows it better
Than the girl in the corner
With the Scarlet Letter
And while you're watching
You may think that she doesn't matter
But no one knows you better

[Hook (Variation)]
I wanna dance, I wanna dance, I wanna dance with you- you
So, take a chance
So, take a chance
Oh yeah
I wanna dance, I wanna dance, I wanna dance with you- you
I wanna dance, I wanna dance
Oh yeah

[Post-Hook]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
