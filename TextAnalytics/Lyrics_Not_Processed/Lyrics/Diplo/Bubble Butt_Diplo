[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Drop it low, put it in the dirt
Sex drive, put it in reverse
Killed her ass, put it in a hearse
Then I drove off and put it in the dirt
Drop it low, put in the dirt
Take your top off, turn into a vert
Bubble butt, busted in her throat
Smoking bubble kush wearing a bubble coat

[Verse 3: Mystic]
I had a cute thing, buenas noches
By the end of the night my knees are now on your chest
Fuck me bad, let me in, a cardic arrest
Make me come, make me come
Come, we know you are the best
Who's bad? Let me wind up on your cock
Tick-tock-tick, riding the clock
Beat it, beat it, beat it bad, let me show you what I've got
I ain't Snoop Dogg, but I'mma drop it like it's hot

[Verse 4: Tyga]
OK, open up your Bubba Gump,
 let me see your bumper
The booty so smooth, can't believe it's not butter
I go in from under, she wetter than a surfer
I ate the pussy fast, I'm about to start burping
I burp, burp and re-lick the bottom of the surface
I loaded my clip in and told her, "Don't get nervous"
I'm a Bang Bang Chiddy Bang, bang, bang killer
Nipple tit clit licker, ball like a dribble
Put you in a pickle, nibble on my dickle
Why you tripping? I'm a crazy individual
Never do minimum, drive Benz, Bentley too
Damn, bitch, talk much? I don't want interviews
I'm trying to get into you (into you) then make you my enemy
Not playing, got the bitch mad
Me don't like flat screen ass, I need a 3D
