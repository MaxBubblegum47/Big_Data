[Verse 1]
I feel the water flow as I watch him go
Boy, life is cynical despite my heart of gold
Oh, no, buddy don't you cry as they go
Life changes all of us, it's not your fault, no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Where did they all run to?
Oh-oh-oh
Where the sky is blue forever
Oh-oh-oh
Where the sky is blue forever

[Chorus]
Love is a dangerous business you know
Who's gonna care for your bleeding soul?
Take a run, take a run with me
Where the sky is blue forever
'Til the end of time

[Verse 2]
And dear, buddy don't you cry when she goes
'Cause life is cynical despite your heart of gold
Oh, no, buddy don't you cry as they go
Life makes us critical and all, we gotta change the course

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Where did they all run to?
Oh-oh-oh
Where the sky is blue forever
Oh-oh-oh
Where the sky is blue forever

[Chorus]
Love is a dangerous business you know
Who's gonna care for your bleeding soul?
Take a run, take a run with me
Where the sky is blue forever
'Til the end of time
Run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away
Where the sky is blue forever

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh
Where did they all run to?
Oh-oh-oh
Where the sky is blue forever
Oh-oh-oh
Where did they all run to?
Oh-oh-oh
Where the sky is blue forever
'Til the end of time

[Chorus]
Love is a dangerous business you know
Who's gonna care for your bleeding soul?
Take a run, take a run with me
'Til the end of time
Love is a dangerous business you know
Who's gonna care for your bleeding soul?
Take a run, we can all be free
Where the sky is blue forever
