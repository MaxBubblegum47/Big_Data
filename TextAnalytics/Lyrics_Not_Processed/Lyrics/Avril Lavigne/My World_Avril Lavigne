[Verse 1]
Please tell me what is takin' place
'Cause I can't seem to find a trace
Guess it must've got erased somehow
Probably 'cause I always forget
Every time someone tells me their name
It's always gotta be the same (In my world)
Never wore cover-up
Always beat the boys up
Grew up in a five thousand population town
Made my money by cutting grass
Got fired by a fried chicken ass
All in a small town, Napanee

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I always stay up without sleepin'
And think to myself
Where do I belong forever?
In whose arms, the time and place?

[Chorus]
Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head, my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world

[Verse 2]
I never spend less than an hour
Washing my hair in the shower
It always takes five hours to make it straight
So I'll braid it in a zillion braids
Though it may take all friggin' day
There's nothin' else better to do anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're all alone in the lands of forever
Lay under the Milky Way
On and on, it's getting too late out
I'm not in love this time, this night

[Chorus]
Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head, my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
I take some time, mellow out
Party it up, but don't fall down
Don't get caught, sneak out of the house

[Chorus]
Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head, my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world

[Chorus]
Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
In this head, my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world
