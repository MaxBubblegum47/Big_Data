[Verse 1]
Are you aware of what you make me feel, baby?
Right now I feel invisible to you, like I'm not real
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you?
Why'd you turn away?
Here's what I have to say

[Pre-Chorus]
I was left to cry there
Waitin' outside there
Grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided

[Chorus]
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm startin' to trip, I'm losing my grip
And I'm in this thing alone

[Verse 2]
Am I just some chick you placed beside you to take somebody's place?
When you turn around, can you recognize my face?
You used to love me, you used to hug me
But that wasn't the case
Everything wasn't okay

[Pre-Chorus]
I was left to cry there
Waitin' outside there
Grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided

[Chorus]
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm startin' to trip, I'm losing my grip
And I'm in this thing alone

[Bridge]
Cryin' out loud, I'm cryin' out loud
Cryin' out loud, I'm cryin' out loud
Open your eyes
Open up wide
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone

[Chorus]
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
Why should I care?
If you don't care, then I don't care
We're not goin' anywhere

[Chorus]
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
Why should I care?
If you don't care, then I don't care
We're not goin' anywhere
