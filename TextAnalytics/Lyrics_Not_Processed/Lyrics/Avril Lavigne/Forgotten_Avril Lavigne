[Intro]
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I'm givin' up on everything
Because you messed me up
Don't know how much you screwed it up
You never listen
That's just too bad
Because I'm movin' on, I won't forget
You were the one that was wrong
I know I need to step up and be strong
Don't patronize me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Gotta get away
There's no point in thinking about yesterday
It's too late now, it won't ever be the same
We're so different now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
I know I wanna run away
I know I wanna run away, run away
If only I could run away
If only I could run away, run away
I told you what I wanted
I told you what I wanted, what I wanted
But I was forgotten
I won't be forgotten
Never again

[Chorus]
Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
Do you get it now?

[Chorus]
Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now?
You never got it
Do you get it now?
Have you forgotten?
Do you get it now?

[Outro]
Forgotten
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Forgotten
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Forgotten
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Forgotten
Yeah, yeah, yeah
