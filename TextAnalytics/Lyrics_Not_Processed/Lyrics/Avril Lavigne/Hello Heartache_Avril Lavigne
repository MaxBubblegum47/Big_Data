[Intro]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
You were perfect, I was unpredictable
It was more than worth it, but not too sensible
Young and foolish seemed to be the way
I was stupid to think that I could stay
Oh, oh, to think that I could stay

[Chorus]
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache
It's not the end, it's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way, but
You will always mean the world to me, love
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Hello heartache
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
I was champagne, you were Jameson
Every bad thing we did was so much fun
I've seen your best side, you got to see my worst
It's not the first time, but this one really hurts
Oh, oh, yeah, this one’s gonna, it hurts

[Chorus]
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache
It's not the end, it's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way, but
You will always mean the world to me, love
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache

[Bridge]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ooh)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ooh)
Do you know? Do you get? (Do you know? Do you get?)
It’s just goodbye, it’s not the end (It’s just goodbye, it’s not the end)
Do you know? Do you get? (Do you know? Do you get?)
It’s just goodbye, it’s not the end (It’s just goodbye, it’s not the end)
Oh

[Chorus]
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache
It's not the end, it's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way, but
You will always mean the world to me, love
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Hello heartache
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
(Hello heartache)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Wish it didn't have to be this way, but
You will always mean the world to me, love
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
