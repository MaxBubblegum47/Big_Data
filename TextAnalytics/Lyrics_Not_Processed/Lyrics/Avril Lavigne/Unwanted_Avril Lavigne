[Verse 1]
All that I did was walk over, start off by shakin' your hands
That's how it went
I had a smile on my face and I sat up straight
Oh, yeah, yeah
I wanted to know you, I wanted to show you

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't ignore me
You don't want me there, you just shut me out
You don't know me, don't ignore me
If you had your way, you'd just shut me up
Make me go away
(That I'm so unwanted)

[Verse 2]
No, I just don't understand why you won't talk to me
It hurts that I'm so unwanted for nothing
Don't talk words against me
I wanted to know you, I wanted to show you

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't ignore me
You don't want me there, you just shut me out
You don't know me, don't ignore me
If you had your way, you'd just shut me up
Make me go away
Make me go away

[Bridge]
I tried to belong, it didn't seem wrong
My head aches
It's been so long, I'll write this song
If that's what it takes

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't ignore me
You don't want me there, you just shut me out
You don't know me, don't ignore me
If you had your way, you'd just shut me up
Make me go away

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't ignore me
You don't want me there, you just shut me out
You don't know me, don't ignore me
If you had your way, you'd just shut me up
Make me go away
Make me go away

[Outro]
Make me go away
