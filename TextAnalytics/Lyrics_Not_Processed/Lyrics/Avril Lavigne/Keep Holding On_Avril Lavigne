[Verse 1]
You're not alone, together we stand
I'll be by your side, you know I'll take your hand
When it gets cold and it feels like the end
There's no place to go, you know I won't give in
No, I won't give in

[Chorus]
Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
Just stay strong
'Cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you
There's nothing you could say (Nothing you could say)
Nothing you could do (Nothing you could do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through

[Verse 2]
So far away, I wish you were here
Before it's too late, this could all disappear
Before the doors close and it comes to an end
With you by my side, I will fight and defend
I'll fight and defend
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
Just stay strong
'Cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you
There's nothing you could say (Nothing you could say)
Nothing you could do (Nothing you could do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through

[Bridge]
Hear me when I say, when I say I believe
Nothing's gonna change, nothing's gonna change destiny
Whatever's meant to be will work out perfectly
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
La, da-da-da
La, da-da-da
La, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Chorus]
Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
Just stay strong
'Cause you know I'm here for you, I'm here for you
There's nothing you could say (Nothing you could say)
Nothing you could do (Nothing you could do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
Keep holding on
Keep holding on

[Outro]
There's nothing you could say (Nothing you could say)
Nothing you could do (Nothing you could do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So keep (Keep) holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through
