[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, je n'aime pas ta copine
No way, no way, tu as besoin d'une nouvelle
Hey, hey, you, you, je serai(s) ta copine!
Hey, hey, you, you, je sais que tu m'aimes bien
No way, no way, ce n'est pas un secret
Hey, hey, you, you, je serai(s) ta copine!

[Verse 1]
You're so fine, I want you mine, you're so delicious
I think about you all the time, you're so addictive
Don't you know what I can do to make you feel alright?
(Alright, alright, alright, alright)
Don't pretend, I think you know I'm damn precious
And hell yeah, I'm the motherfucking princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I'm right
(I'm right, I'm right, I'm right, I'm right)

[Pre-Chorus]
She’s like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that’s what everyone’s talking about

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, je n'aime pas ta copine
No way, no way, tu as besoin d'une nouvelle
Hey, hey, you, you, je serai(s) ta copine!
Hey, hey, you, you, je sais que tu m'aimes bien
No way, no way, ce n'est pas un secret
Hey, hey, you, you, je serai(s) ta copine!

[Verse 2]
I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away, I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again
(Again, again, again)
So come over here and tell me what I wanna hear
(So come over here)
Better yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again
(And again, and again, and again)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she’s like so whatever
And you could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that’s what everyone’s talking about


Hey, hey, you, you, je n'aime pas ta copine
No way, no way, tu as besoin d'une nouvelle
Hey, hey, you, you, je serai(s) ta copine!
Hey, hey, you, you, je sais que tu m'aimes bien
No way, no way, ce n'est pas un secret
Hey, hey, you, you, je serai(s) ta copine!

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, je n'aime pas ta copine
No way, no way, tu as besoin d'une nouvelle
Hey, hey, you, you, je serai(s) ta copine! (No way, no way)
Hey, hey, you, you, je sais que tu m'aimes bien
No way, no way, ce n'est pas un secret
Hey, hey, you, you, je serai(s) ta copine! (no way, no way)

[Bridge]
In a second, you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?
In a second, you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, je n'aime pas ta copine
No way, no way, tu as besoin d'une nouvelle
Hey, hey, you, you, je serai(s) ta copine! (No way, no way)
(No way, no way)
Hey, hey, you, you, je sais que tu m'aimes bien
No way, no way, ce n'est pas un secret
Hey, hey, you, you, je n'aime pas ta copine
Hey, hey, you, you, je n'aime pas ta copine (No way, no way)
(No way, no way), tu as besoin d'une nouvelle
Hey, hey, you, you, je serai(s) ta copine! (No way, no way)
Hey, hey, you, you, je sais que tu m'aimes bien
No way, no way, ce n'est pas un secret
Hey, hey, you, you, je serai(s) ta copine! (no way, no way)
Hey, hey!
