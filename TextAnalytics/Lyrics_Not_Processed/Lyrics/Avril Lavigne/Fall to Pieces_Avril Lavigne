[Verse 1]
I looked away
Then I looked back at you
You try to say
Things that you can't undo
If I had my way
I'd never get over you
Today's the day
I pray that we make it through
Make it through the fall
Make it through it all

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you
I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you
I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I'm in love with you

[Verse 2]
You're the only one
I'd be with till the end
When I come undone
You bring me back again
Back under the stars
Back into your arms

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you
I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you
I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I'm in love with you

[Bridge]
Wanna know who you are
Wanna know where to start
I wanna know what this means
Wanna know how you feel
Wanna know what is real
I wanna know everything, everything

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you
I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you
I don't wanna to talk about it
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you
I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you
And I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I'm in love with you

[Outro]
I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
