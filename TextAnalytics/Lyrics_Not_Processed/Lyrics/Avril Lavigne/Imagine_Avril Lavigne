[Verse 1]
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

[Verse 2]
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

[Chorus]
And you, you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will be as one

[Verse 3]
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Oh oh oh
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

[Chorus]
And you, you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will be as one
