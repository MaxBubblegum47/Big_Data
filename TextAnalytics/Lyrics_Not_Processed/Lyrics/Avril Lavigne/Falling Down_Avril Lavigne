[Verse 1]
If fears what makes us decide
Our future journey
Well, I'm not along for the ride (I'm not along for the ride)
'Cause I'm still yearning
To try and touch the sun (To try and touch the sun)
My fingers burning
Before you're old, you are young
Yeah, I'm still learning

[Chorus]
I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good to hit the ground
You can watch me
Fall right on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down

[Verse 2]
I'm standing out in the street (I'm standing out in the street)
The earth is moving
I feel it under my feet (I feel it under my feet)
And I'm still proving
That I can stand my ground
And my feet are there, haven't washed my hair
To be lost before you are found
Don't mean you're losing

[Chorus]
I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good to hit the ground
You can watch me
Fall right on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down

[Bridge]
Someday, I'll live in a house
Etc., etc., etc
But you know that's not for now
And for now, I'm falling
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down (I am falling down)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good to hit the ground
You can watch me
Fall right on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down

[Outro]
I'm falling down
I'm falling down, I'm falling down
I'm falling
Feels so good to hit the ground
I'm falling down
I am falling
