[Intro]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Lo-lo-love me insane
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
You pick up all of the pieces and put 'em back again
You stitch and sew my heart up all by hand, yeah
I know a good thing when I see one, yeah
And you know I didn’t see this coming

[Chorus]
So, baby, let's go insane, insane
Yeah, you make me lose my brain, my brain
From the minute that you asked me what's my name
I know it’s a dangerous game
But love me insane

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Lo-lo-love me insane
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Lo-lo-love me insane

[Verse 2]
Taking all my clothes off and jumping in, yeah
This time I'm going all out, sink or swim, oh
I know an angel when I see one
I've been stuck with way too many demons, oh

[Chorus]
So, baby, let's go insane, insane
Yeah, you make me lose my brain, my brain
From the minute that you asked me what's my name
I know it's a dangerous game
But love me insane

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Lo-lo-love me insane
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Bridge]
And if I fall now, will you catch me?
And if I fall now, will you catch me?
'Cause I can't do this on my own

[Chorus 2]
So, baby, let’s go insane, insane
Yeah, you make me lose my brain, my brain
(Lo-lo-love me insane)
So, baby, let’s go insane, insane
Yeah, you make me lose my brain, my brain
(Lo-lo-love me insane)
