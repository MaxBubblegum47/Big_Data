[Verse 1]
All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na

[Verse 2]
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

[Chorus]

[Verse 3][x2]
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill
