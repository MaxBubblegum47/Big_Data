[Verse 1: Avril]
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of my dear saviorâ€™s birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth

[Bridge: Chantal]
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

[Verse 2: Avril]
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices!
O night divine, oh night when Christ was born!
O night divine, oh night, oh night divine!

[Verse 3: Chantal, 3rd verse of the original]
Truly he taught us to love one another
His law is love and his gospel is peace
Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease

[Verse 4: Avril]
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise his holy name
[Avril, Chantal a high pitched accompaniment]
Christ is the king! That ever, ever praise we!
His power and glory evermore proclaim
His power and glory evermore proclaim

[Outro]
[Avril] oh-oh, oh, oh
Avril, Chantal a high pitched accompaniment]
His power and glory evermore proclaim
His power and glory evermore proclaim
