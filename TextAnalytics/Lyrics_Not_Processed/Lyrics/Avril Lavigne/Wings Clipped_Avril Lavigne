[Verse 1: Avril Lavigne]
All your lovers, no they're not your friends
Learned the hard way fast
That every time you give someone your trust
They throw it back, they throw it back
Another Sunday waking on the ground
Signal breaking down
'Cause every time you said they loved you
Left and took it back, took it back

[Pre-Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
Taken hostage
Cut your tongue
They make you watch as
The world slips by you
Chasing something
You're crying out, crying out, oh

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
They say it's weakness
But you're just an angel with your wings clipped
Someone came and took all of your secrets
Now you can't fly away, you can't fly away, ay
They say it's madness
Future on the line, you're moving backwards
Someone came and broke you right in half
So that you can't fly away, that you can't fly away, ay

[Post-Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
But you're just an angel with your wi-

[Verse 2: Anthony Green]
Got you covered like a body suit
Made of lead and doubt
But you're still wondering why you feel too heavy
To go out, to go out
People calling in a state for you
Think they love too loud
And so you push them all away
But it's too damn quiet now, quiet now

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Green]
Taken hostage
Cut your tongue
They make you watch as
The world slips by you
Chasing something
You're crying out, crying out, oh

[Chorus: Anthony Green]
They say it's weakness
But you're just an angel with your wings clipped
Someone came and took all of your secrets
Now you can't fly away, now you can't fly away, ay
They say it's madness
Future on the line, you're moving backwards
Someone came and broke you right in half
So that you can't fly away, that you can't fly away, ay

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Green]
You can't fly away
