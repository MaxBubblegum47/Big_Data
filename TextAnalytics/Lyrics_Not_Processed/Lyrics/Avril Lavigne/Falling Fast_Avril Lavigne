[Verse 1]
I woke up and saw the sun today
You came by without a warning
You put a smile on my face
I want that for every morning

[Pre-Chorus]
What is it I'm feelin'? 'Cause I can't let it go
If seein' is believin', then I already know

[Chorus]
I'm falling fast, I hope this lasts
I'm falling hard for you
I say let's take a chance, take it while we can
I know you feel it too
I'm falling fast
I'm falling fast, yeah

[Verse 2]
Doesn't matter what we do
You make everything seem brighter
I never knew I needed you
Like a sad song needs a sea of lighters

[Pre-Chorus]
What is it I'm feelin'? 'Cause I can't let it go
If seein' is believin', I already know

[Chorus]
I'm falling fast, God, I hope this lasts 'cause
I'm falling hard for you
I say let's take a chance
Take it while we can 'cause
I know you feel it too
I'm falling fast
I'm falling fast, hmm

[Bridge]
I hope you know, I hope it lasts
I'm falling hard, I'm falling fast
We can go, no holding back (For you)
I hope you know, I hope it lasts
I'm falling hard, I'm falling fast (For you)
We can go, no holding back

[Chorus]
I'm falling fast, I hope this lasts
I'm falling hard for you
I say let's take a chance, take it while we can
I know you feel it too
I'm falling fast
I'm falling fast
