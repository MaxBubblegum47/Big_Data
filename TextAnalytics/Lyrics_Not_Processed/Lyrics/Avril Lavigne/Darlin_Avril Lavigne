[Verse 1]
Darlin', you're hiding in the closet once again
Start smilin'
I know you're tryin' real hard not to turn your head away
Pretty darlin'
Face tomorrow, tomorrow's not yesterday
Yesterday, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Pretty please, I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothin' else I can do but love you the best that I can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Darlin', I was there once a while ago
I know
That it's hard to be stuck with people that you love
When nobody trusts

[Chorus]
Pretty please, I know it's a drag (Know it's a drag)
Wipe your eyes and put up your head (Put up your head)
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothin' else I can do but love you the best that I can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That I can, oh

[Bridge]
And you're not the only one who's been through it
I've been there alone and now so are you
I just want you to know, want you to know it's not your fault
It's not your fault
Oh
Oh
Your fault
Your fault
It's not your fault
Your fault, your fault, your fault

[Chorus]
Pretty please, I know it's a drag (Know it's a drag)
Wipe your eyes and put up your head (Put up your head)
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothin' else I can do but love you the best that I can

[Chorus]
Pretty please, I know it's a drag (Know it's a drag)
Wipe your eyes and put up your head (Put up your head)
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothin' else I can do but love you the best that I can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That I can, oh

[Outro]
Darlin', you're hiding in the closet once again
Start smilin'
