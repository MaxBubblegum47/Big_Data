[Verse 1]
Went back home again
This sucks, gotta pack up and leave again
Say goodbye to all my friends
Can't say when I'll be there again
It's time now to turn around
Turn my back on everything
Turn my back on everything

[Chorus]
Everything's changin' when I turn around
All out of my control, I'm a mobile
Everything's changin' when I turn around
All out of my control, I'm a mobile
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 2]
Start back at this life
Stretch myself back into the vibe
I'm wakin' up to say I've tried
Instead of wakin' up to another TV Guide
It's time now to turn around
Turn and walk on this crazy ground, oh

[Chorus]
Everything's changin' when I turn around
All out of my control, I'm a mobile
Everything's changin' out of what I know
Everywhere I go, I'm a mobile
I'm a mobile

[Bridge]
Hangin' from the ceiling
Life's a mobile
Spinnin' 'round with mixed feelings
Crazy and wild
Sometimes, I wanna scream out loud

[Chorus]
Everything's changin' everywhere I go
All out of my control
Everything's changin' everywhere I go
Out of what I know
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Breakdown]
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

[Chorus]
Everything's changin' when I turn around
All out of my control, I'm a mobile
Everything's changin' out of what I know
Everywhere I go, I'm a mobile
Everywhere I go, I'm a mobile
