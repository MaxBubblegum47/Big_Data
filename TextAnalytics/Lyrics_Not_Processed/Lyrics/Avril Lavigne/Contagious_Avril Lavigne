[Intro]
Uh-oh
Uh-oh

[Verse 1]
When you're around, I don't know what to do
I do not think that I can wait
To go over and to talk to you
I do not know what I should say

[Pre-Chorus]
And I walk out in silence
That's when I start to realize
What you bring to my life
Damn, this guy can make me cry

[Chorus]
It's so contagious
I cannot get it out of my mind
It's so outrageous
You make me feel so high
All the time

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-oh
Uh-oh

[Verse 2]
They all say that you're no good for me (Good for me)
But I'm too close to turn around
I'll show them they don't know anything (Know anything)
I think I got you figured out

[Pre-Chorus]
So I walk out in silence
That's when I start to realize
What you bring to my life
Damn, this guy can make me smile

[Chorus]
It's so contagious
I cannot get it out of my mind
It's so outrageous
You make me feel so high

[Bridge]
I'll give you everything
I'll treat you right
If you just give me a chance
I can prove I'm right

[Chorus]
It's so contagious (Hey, hey)
I cannot get it out of my mind (Out of my mind)
It's so outrageous
You make me feel so high

[Chorus]
It's so contagious (Hey, hey)
I cannot get it out of my mind (Out of my mind)
It's so outrageous
You make me feel so high
All the time
