[Intro]
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll

[Verse 1]
I don't care about my makeup
I like it better with my jeans all ripped up
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut
You say "So what?" (What?)
I don't care if I'm a misfit
I like it better than the hipster bullshit
I am the motherfuckin' princess
You still love it (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Some-somehow, it's a little different when I'm with you
You know what I really am all about
You know how it really goes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Some-some way, we'll be getting out of this town one day
You're the only one that I want with me
You know how the story goes
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll

[Post-Chorus]
Rock 'n' roll!
Hey, hey, hey
Rock 'n' roll!
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Call it a bad attitude, dude
I'm never gonna cover up that tattoo
I might have a couple issues
You say "Me too" (Yeah)
Don't care about a reputation (Nuh-uh)
Must be living in the wrong generation
This is your invitation
Let's get wasted (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Some-somehow, it's a little different when I'm with you
You know what I really am all about
You know how the story goes
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll

[Post-Chorus]
Rock 'n' roll!
Hey, hey, hey
Rock 'n' roll!
Hey, hey, hey
Rock 'n' roll!

[Bridge]
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll

[Chorus]
When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll

[Post-Chorus]
Rock 'n' roll!
Hey, hey, hey
Rock 'n' roll!
Hey, hey, hey
