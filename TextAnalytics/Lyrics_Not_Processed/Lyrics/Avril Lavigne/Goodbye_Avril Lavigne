[Verse 1]
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye my love
I can't hide, can't hide
Can't hide what has come

[Chorus]
I have to go, I have to go
I have to go and leave you alone
But always know, always know
Always know that I love you so
I love you so
I love you so, oh

[Verse 2]
Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye for now
Goodbye sunshine
Take care of yourself

[Chorus]
I have to go, I have to go
I have to go and leave you alone
But always know, always know
Always know that I love you so
I love you so, oh
I love you so, oh

[Bridge]
La lullaby, distract me with your rhymes
La lullaby
La lullaby, help me sleep tonight
La lullaby
(La lullaby, la lullaby)

[Chorus]
I have to go (Goodbye)
I have to go (Lullaby)
I have to go (Goodbye)
And leave you alone
But always know (Goodbye)
Always know (Brown eyes)
Always know (Goodbye)
That I love you so
I love you so (Goodbye lullaby)
I love you so, oh (Goodbye)
I love you so (Goodbye brown eyes)
I love you so (Goodbye)
I love you so
I love you so

[Outro]
Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye my love
