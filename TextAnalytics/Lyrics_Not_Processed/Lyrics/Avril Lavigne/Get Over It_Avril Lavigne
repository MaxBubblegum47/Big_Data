[Verse 1]
Slipping down a slide
I did enjoy the ride
Don't know what to decide
You lied to me
You looked me in the eye
It took me by surprise
Now are you gratified?
You cried to me
La, la, la, la, la, la

[Chorus]
Don't turn around
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
It's too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it

[Verse 2]
When I was feeling down
You'd start to hang around
And then I found your hands all over me
And that was out of bounds
You filthy rotten hound
It's badder than it sounds, believe me
La, la, la, la, la, la

[Chorus]
Don't turn around
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
It's too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it

[Bridge]
Hey, yeah
You gotta get over
Hey, yeah
You gotta get over it
Too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it
Oh

[Chorus]
Don't turn around
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
Don't turn around
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
It's too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it

[Outro]
You'll have to get over it
