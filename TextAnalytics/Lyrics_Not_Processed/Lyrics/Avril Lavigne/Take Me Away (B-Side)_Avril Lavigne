[Verse 1]
Don’t say no to anything
Yes, yes, say yes to everything
Just find away, to get away (wanna run away?)
Let’s take off our clothes, and see if anybody notices
Then run away, what d'you say?
Have a little joy, have a little faith, live life
Have a little hope have a lot of fun

[Hook]
'Cause you, you
You never know what fate will throw
To make you stop
I, I, I’m gonna try
To let this life
Pick me up and take me away

[Verse 2]
Run up to a stranger
Kiss and tell them that you love them
And then walk away
You made their day (at least you hope you did)
Stand up in a restaurant
Start dancing on the table
Get kicked out for bad behavior (Oops, I did it again!)
Have a little joy, have a little faith, live life
Have a little hope have a lot of fun

[Hook]
'Cause you, you
You never know what fate will throw
To make you stop
I, I, I’m gonna try
To let this life
Pick me up and take me away

[Bridge]
Don’t you know that nothing equals nothing?
Do anything, do everything, do something
Open up your mouth and let your soul sing
You, you
You never know what faith will throw
To make you stop

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook]
You, you
You never know what fate will throw
To make you stop
I’m gonna try
To let this life
Pick me up and take me away
