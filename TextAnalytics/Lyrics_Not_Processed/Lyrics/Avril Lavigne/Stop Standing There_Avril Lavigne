[Verse 1]
All this talkin' to you
I don't know what I'm to do
I don't know where you stand
What's inside of your head?
All this thinkin' of you
Is that what you're doin' too?
You're always on my mind
I talk about you all of the time

[Chorus]
Don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it
So open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I can show you who I am

[Verse 2]
You're just standin' by
You're just wastin' time
Why don't you just tell me the truth
About me and you?
And as the time goes by
I hope you realize
If you ask me to
I just might be with you

[Chorus]
So don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it
Open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I can show you who I am

[Bridge]
Stop standing there
Standing there
And stop acting like you don't care
And stop being scared, being scared
Stop acting like you don't care

[Chorus]
So don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it
Open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I can show you who I am

[Chorus]
So don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it
Open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I can show you who I am

[Outro]
Who I am
Who I am
Who I am
