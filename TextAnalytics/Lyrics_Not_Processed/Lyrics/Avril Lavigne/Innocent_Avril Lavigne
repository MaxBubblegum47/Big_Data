[Intro - Avril Lavigne]

This innocence is brilliant, I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect, please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it, don't you let it pass you by

[Hook - Avril Lavigne & Jack Rootes]

This innocence is brilliant, I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect, please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it, don't you let it pass you-

[Verse 1 - Jack Rootes]

She's beautiful, simple as
So sweet, with no catch
A shy girl that keeps to herself
Her only concern; her own health
Her life seems so perfect
Negativity, she’d deflect
So much joy she’d present
A smile on her face wherever she went
But behind it all, she wears a mask
Keeping it on, such a huge task
While she acted happy and peppy
Inside, she feels cold and empty
She acts like she’s alright
But she cries herself to sleep at night
Whenever her friends go out and play
She sees the whole world coloured grey

When her depression burns through
She feels there’s no one to turn to
No one ‘round to make amends
She’d even hide it from her friends
Feels no choice, but to bitterly
Wallow in her misery
Even with her family there
She thinks no one really cares
So many bad thoughts ‘round her head
Feels at times she should be dead
They do see her now and then
But not the notes from her pen
That she writes in her diary
She’s silent at inquiries
Friends and family don’t notice a thing
‘Till they walk away, then she starts to sing

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

He’s popular, with the girls
In a way, he’s on top of the world
All the girls swoon when they see him
And all the guys want to be him
He has so many football dreams
He’s even captain of his school’s team
So many friends that have his back
He’s the leader of the pack
But inside, like the girl from before
His mental state is an eyesore
Doesn’t take much for his joy to plummet
Low moods make him sick to his stomach
So on his lonely days
He would go and hide away
He’d open up with razor blades
He’d rather feel anything but pain!

And he wouldn’t stop on the first tread
He would cut ‘till his arm turned red!
And then, he’d pull himself together
Wearing long sleeves, even in hot weather
To hide the scars of his previous wounds
From his friends and the other groups
‘Cause as far as his thoughts go
Nobody else has to know
He knows that all of these painful ways
Will leave him dead, one of these days
When in public, he would deceive
Acting like his arms don’t bleed
He doesn’t want to be alone
But nobody ever calls his phone
So, to mask away his pain
Headphones on, he drifts away

[Hook]
