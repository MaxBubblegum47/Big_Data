[Verse 1]
Your car's parked in the driveway
You're standing in the hallway
Last time you're gonna kiss me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause the seasons are changing
So put your hands on my body
Show me how much you want me
(Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna tell you lies
I don't mean to hurt you, baby
'Cause you make me feel alive
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't wanna tell you lies
I don't mean to hurt you, baby
'Cause you make me feel alive

[Chorus]
After the summer, can we keep in touch?
After November, can we call it love?
So I wanna love you
Nobody but you
Let's keep in touch

[Post-Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Keep in touch
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Stay awake with me all night
Run away from real life
Even though I just met ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I feel like I know ya
When you stare into my blue eyes
And I'll never forget ya
(Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna tell you lies
I don't mean to hurt you, baby
'Cause you make me feel alive

[Chorus]
After the summer, can we keep in touch?
After November, can we call it love?
So I wanna love you
Nobody but you
Let's keep in touch

[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Keep in touch
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't wanna live without you, -out you, -out you
I don't wanna live without you, -out you, -out you
(Yeah, yeah)
Don't wanna go home
Don't leave me here alone
'Cause I don't wanna live without you
'Cause I think that I love you
Yeah, I really, really love you
And there's nobody but you

[Chorus]
After the summer, can we keep in touch?
After November, can we call it love?
So I wanna love you
Nobody but you
Let's keep in touch

[Outro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Keep in touch
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's keep in touch
