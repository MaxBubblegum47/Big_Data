[Intro]
Hey, yeah, oh, oh
Hey, yeah, oh, oh
Hey, yeah, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I’ve only got three dollars left in my hands
I walk down the sidewalk as I pass a dirty man
Walk up the staircase that leads to my hotel
I’m living in at a fancy hotel, yeah, yeah
Then I’ll go up to my room
Fixate on what’s the deal
I’m alone again
Then I will crawl into the bed
And call you up to tell you off

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m on my own, would you leave me alone?
Before I lose my mind
'Cause you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight, if I let you go tonight
Yeah, yeah, let go
Hey, yeah, oh oh

[Verse 2]
I’ll probably wake up a little sad
But then I’ll get up and let go of it all instead
'Cause really it’s not worth it
To get in a mess over him
To bother get stressed over him
So I’ll just go on with my life
And fixate on everything else but you
Yea I’ll just go on with my life
I have no reason to please you anymore

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m on my own, would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind
Because you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight, if I let you go

[Bridge]
So find your way out of my sight
I know it’s hard, it’s tough to laugh
It’s all messed up, don’t play this game

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m on my own, would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind
Because you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight, if I let you go
'Cause I’m on my own, would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind
Because you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight, if I let you go

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Getting stressed over you
Getting messed over you
