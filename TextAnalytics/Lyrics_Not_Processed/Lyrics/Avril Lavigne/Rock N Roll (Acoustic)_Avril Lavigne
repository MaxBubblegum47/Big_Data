[Verse 1]
I don't care about my makeup
I like it better with my jeans all ripped up
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut
You say "So what?" (What?)
I don't care if I'm a misfit
I like it better than the hipster bullshit
I am the motherfuckin' princess
You still love it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Some-somehow, it's a little different when I'm with you
You know what I really am all about
You know how it really goes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Some-some way, we'll be getting out of this town one day
You're the only one that I want with me
You know how the story goes
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
When it's you and me, we don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turnin' up the radio
What if you and I just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll

[Post-Chorus]
Rock 'n' roll!
Hey, hey, hey
Rock 'n' roll!
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Call it a bad attitude, dude
I'm never gonna cover up that tattoo
I might have a couple issues
You say "Me too"
Don't care about a reputation (Nuh-uh)
Must be living in the wrong generation
This is your invitation
Let's get wasted, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Some-somehow, it's a little different when I'm with you
You know what I really am all about
You know how the story goes
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
When it's you and me, we don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turnin' up the radio
What if you and I just put up a middle finger to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll

[Post-Chorus]
Rock 'n' roll!
Hey, hey, hey
Rock 'n' roll!
Hey, hey, hey
Rock 'n' roll!

[Bridge]
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
When it's you and me, we don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turnin' up the radio
What if you and I just put up a middle finger (To the sky) to the sky?
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll

[Chorus]
When it's you and me we don't need no one to tell us who to be (Yeah)
We'll keep turnin' up the radio (Still rock 'n' roll)
What if you and I just put up (Yeah) a middle finger to the sky? (Rock 'n' roll)
Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll

[Post-Chorus]
Rock 'n' roll!
(Hey) Hey, (Hey) hey, (Hey) hey
(We're gonna show 'em how to)
Rock 'n' roll!
(Hey) Hey, (Hey) hey, (Hey) hey
