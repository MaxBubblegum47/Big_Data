[Verse 1]
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
You're livin' in the past, it's a new generation
A girl can do what she wants to do
And that's what I'm gonna do
And I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation

[Refrain]
Oh no, not me

[Verse 2]
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
Never said I wanted to improve my station
And I'm only doin' good when I'm havin' fun
And I don't have to please no one
And I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation

[Refrain]
Oh no, not me
Oh no! Not me!

[Verse 3]
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
I've never been afraid of any deviation
And I don't really care if you think I'm strange
I ain't gonna change
And I'm never gonna care 'bout my bad reputation

[Refrain]
Oh no, not me
Oh no! Not me!
Oh!

[Verse 4]
And I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
The world's in trouble, there's no communication
And everyone can say what they wanna say
It never gets better anyway
So, why should I care 'bout a bad reputation, anyway?

[Refrain]
Oh no, not me
Oh no! Not me!

[Verse 5]
I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation
You're livin' in the past, it's a new generation
And I only feel good when I got no pain
And that's how I'm gonna stay
And I don't give a damn 'bout a bad reputation

[Refrain]
Oh no, not me
Oh no! Not me!
Oh no! Not me!
Hey!
