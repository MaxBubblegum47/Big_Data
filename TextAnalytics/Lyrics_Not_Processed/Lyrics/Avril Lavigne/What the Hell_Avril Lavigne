[Verse 1]
You say that I'm messing with your head
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
All 'cause I was makin' out with your friend
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Love hurts, whether it's right or wrong
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
I can't stop 'cause I'm havin' too much fun
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You're on your knees, beggin' "Please, stay with me"
But honestly, I just need to be a little crazy

[Chorus]
All my life I've been good, but now
I'm thinkin' "What the hell?"
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about
If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good, but now
Whoa, what the hell?

[Post-Chorus]
What? What?
What? What the hell?

[Verse 2]
So what if I go out on a million dates?
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
You never call or listen to me anyway
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
I'd rather rage than sit around and wait all day
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Don't get me wrong, I just need some time to play

[Pre-Chorus]
You're on your knees, beggin' "Please, stay with me"
But honestly, I just need to be a little crazy (Crazy)

[Chorus]
All my life I've been good, but now
I'm thinkin' "What the hell?"
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about
If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good, but now
Whoa, what the hell?

[Bridge]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, whoa, whoa
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, whoa, whoa
You say that I'm messing with your head
Boy, I like messing in your bed
Yeah, I am messing with your head
When I'm messing with you in bed

[Chorus]
All my life I've been good, but now
I'm thinkin' "What the hell?" (What the hell?)
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about (I don't care about)
All my life I've been good, but now
I'm thinkin' "What the hell?"
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about (If you love me)
If you love me (No), if you hate me (No)
You can't save me, baby, baby (If you love me)
All my life I've been good, but now
Whoa, what the hell?

[Outro]
La, la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la-la-la
