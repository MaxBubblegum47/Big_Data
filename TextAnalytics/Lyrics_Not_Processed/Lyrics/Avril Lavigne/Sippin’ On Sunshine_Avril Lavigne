[Verse 1]
Boy, you get me so high
Buzzin' like a beehive
Just a little kiss, but when it hits my lips
I'm sippin' on sunshine
Boy, you're lookin' so fly
Hotter than July
I just wanna stay, forever and a day
Sippin' on sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
Down at the beach, you're holdin' my hand
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand
Watching the waves crash into the shore
Baby, I want some more

[Chorus]
Hey, what a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothin' but a good time
Sippin' on sunshine
Oh, don't got nowhere to go
So we'll go with the flow
Yeah, we're livin' the life
Sippin' on sunshine

[Post-Chorus]
(Hey)
(Ho) (Sippin' on sunshine)
(Hey)
Sippin' on sunshine

[Verse 2]
Boy, you blow my mind
You got me up on cloud nine
Just a little taste, I wouldn't wanna waste
A sip of that sunshine
We can kick it all night
Underneath the moonlight
But when the party ends, we'll do it all again
Sippin' on sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
Down at the beach, you're holdin' my hand
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand
Watching the waves crash into the shore
Baby, I want some more

[Chorus]
Hey, what a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothin' but a good time
Sippin' on sunshine
Oh, don't got nowhere to go
So we'll go with the flow
Yeah, we're living the life
Sippin' on sunshine

[Post-Chorus]
(Hey)
Sippin' on sunshine
(Ho)
(Hey)
Sippin' on sunshine

[Bridge]
Sippin' on sunshine
Sippin' on sunshine
(Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine)
(Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine)

[Chorus]
Hey, what a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothin' but a good time
Sippin' on sunshine
Oh, don't got nowhere to go (No, I don't)
So we'll go with the flow (Hell yeah)
Yeah, we're living the life (The life)
Sippin' on sunshine

[Outro]
All day, all night
(Sippin on sunshine)
Yeah, a good time
Everybody's just sippin' on sunshine
Whoa, whoa, whoa
(Sippin' on sunshine)
Sippin' on sunshine
