[Verse 1]
Are you aware of what you make me feel, baby?
Right now, I feel invisible to you
Like I'm not real
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you?
Why'd you turn away?
Here's what I have to say

[Pre-Chorus]
I was left to cry there
Waitin' outside there
Grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided

[Chorus]
Why should I care?
Like, you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
And you, you need to listen
I'm startin' to trip
Losing my grip, and I'm in this thing alone

[Verse 2]
Am I just some chick you place beside you
To take somebody's place?
When you turn around, can you recognize my face?
You used to love me, you used to hug me
Oh, but that wasn't the case
Everything wasn't okay, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was left to cry there
Waitin' outside there
Grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided

[Chorus]
Why (Why) should I care? (Care)
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
And you (You), you need to listen (Listen)
I'm startin' to trip
Losing my grip, and I'm in this thing alone

[Bridge]
Cryin' out loud, cryin' out loud
Cryin' out loud, I'm cryin' out loud
And open your eyes
Open up wide
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone

[Outro]
Why (Why) should I care? (Care)
You weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
Why (Why) should I care? (Care)
If you don't care, then I don't care
We're not goin' anywhere
And why (Why) should I care? (Care)
You weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
Why (Why) should I care? (Care)
If you don't care, then I don't care
We're not goin' anywhere
