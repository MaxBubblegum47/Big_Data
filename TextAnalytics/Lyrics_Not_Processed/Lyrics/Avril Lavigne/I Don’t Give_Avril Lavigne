[Verse 1]
Everytime you go away
It actually kinda makes my day
Everytime you leave, you slam the door
You pick your words so carefully
You hate to think you're hurting me
You leave me laughing on the floor 'cause

[Chorus]
I don't give it up
I don't give a damn what you say about that
You know I don't give it up
I don't give a damn what you say about that
You know I'm not gonna cry about some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

[Verse 2]
I thought we were just hangin' out (Hangin' out)
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth?
You thought the way you taste would get me high (Oh)
You went to all your friends to brag (To brag)
Guys are always such a drag (A drag)
Don't you know the reason that I kissed you was to say goodbye?

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't give it up
I don't give a damn what you say about that
You know I don't give it up
I don't give a damn what you say about that
You know I'm not gonna cry about some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

[Bridge]
Hangin', hangin' out
I am simply hangin', hangin' out
I am simply hangin'
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth? (Why'd you kiss me?)
Don't you know that I

[Chorus]
I don't give a damn about you
I won't give it up, not for you
I don't give a damn about you
I won't give it up, not for you
I'm not gonna cry about some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

[Outro]
I don't give it up (I, I don't give it up)
I don't give a damn what you say about that (I don't give a damn)
You know I don't give it up (I don't give it up)
I don't give a damn what you say about that (I don't give a damn)
I don't give it up (I, I, I)
I don't give a damn what you say about that (What you say)
You know I don't give it up (I, I, I)
I don't give a damn what you say about that (What you say)
You know I don't give it up (I, I don't give it up)
I don't give a damn what you say about that (I don't give a damn)
I don't give it up (I, I, I)
I don't give a damn...
