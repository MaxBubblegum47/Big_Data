[Intro]
(Seventeen, seventeen)
(Seventeen, seventeen)

[Verse 1]
He was working at the record shop
I would kiss him in the parking lot
Tasted like cigarettes and soda pop
Seventeen (Seventeen)
He would tell me I was beautiful
Sneaking in the neighbor's swimming pool
Yeah, he taught me how to break the rules
Seventeen

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, those days are long gone
But when I hear that song
It takes me back

[Chorus]
We were on top of the world, back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun, all we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be
Seventeen (Seventeen)

[Verse 2]
Stealing beers out of the trailer park
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark
My favorite place was sittin' in his car
Seventeen (Seventeen)
We laid a blanket on the rooftop
That time, I knew I wouldn't make him stop
The nights were cold, but we kept them hot
Seventeen (Seventeen)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, those days are long gone
But when I hear that song
It takes me back

[Chorus]
We were on top of the world, back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun, all we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be
We were running red lights, we were going all night
Didn't care about anything
'Cause it was you and me, we were living the dream
And we were seventeen

[Post-Chorus]
Oh (Seventeen)
Oh (Seventeen)

[Bridge]
Yeah, I remember what it felt like
Just a small town kind of life
If I could only just go back in time
Seventeen

[Chorus]
We were on top of the world, back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun, all we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be
We were running red lights, we were going all night
Didn't care about anything
'Cause it was you and me, we were living the dream
And we were seventeen

[Outro]
Seventeen (Seventeen, seventeen)
Seventeen (Seventeen, seventeen)
Seventeen
