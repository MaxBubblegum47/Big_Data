[Intro]
I'm the one, I'm the one who knows the dance
I'm the one, I'm the one who's got the prance
I'm the one, I'm the one who wears the pants
I wear the pants
I'm the one who tells you what to do
You're the one, you're the one, if I let you
I'm the one, I'm the one who wears the pants
I wear the pants

[Verse 1]
Hey, you, follow me
I'll take the lead, can't you see?
Don't you question me
You just do what I say

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're thinkin'
I don't care about anything
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm happenin'
I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're thinkin'
I don't care about anything
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm on the scene

[Chorus]
I don't have to try
To make you realize
Anything I wanna do
Anything I'm gonna do
Anything I wanna do, I do
And I don't have to try, huh

[Verse 2]
Don't you disagree
'Cause you know it's all about me
Be at my beck and call
I'm a know-it-all and it's all your fault

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're thinkin'
I don't care about anything
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm happenin'
I don't care what you're sayin'
I don't care what you're thinkin'
I don't care about anything
Get ready, motherfucker, 'cause I'm on the scene

[Chorus]
I don't have to try (Don't have to, don't have to)
To make you realize (To make you, to make you)
Anything I wanna do
Anything I'm gonna do
Anything I wanna do, I do
And I don't have to try (Don't have to try)

[Bridge]
Die
Huh!

[Chorus]
I don't have to try (Don't have to, don't have to)
To make you realize (To make you, to make you)
Anything I wanna do
Anything I'm gonna do
Anything I wanna do, I do
And I don't have to try (Don't have to try)

[Outro]
(Try, try, try)
