[Verse 1]
Something just isn't right
I can feel it inside
The truth isn't far behind me
You can't deny
When I turn the lights out
When I close my eyes
Reality overcomes me
I'm living a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm alone, I
Feel so much better
And when I'm around you
I don't feel

[Chorus]
Together, it doesn't feel right at all
Together, together, we've built a wall
Together, holding hands, we'll fall
Hands, we'll fall

[Verse 2]
This has gone on so long
I realize that I need
Something good to rely on
Something for me

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm alone, I
Feel so much better
And when I'm around you
I don't feel

[Chorus]
Together, it doesn't feel right at all
Together, together, we've built a wall
Together, holding hands, we'll fall
Hands, we'll fall

[Bridge]
My heart is broken
I'm lying here
My thoughts are choking
On you, my dear
On you, my dear
On you, my dear

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm alone, I (When I'm alone)
Feel so much better
And when I'm around you (When I'm around you)
I don't feel

[Chorus]
Together, it doesn't feel right at all
Together, together, we've built a wall
Together, holding hands, we'll fall
Hands, we'll fall
Together, it doesn't feel right at all
Together, together, we've built a wall
Together, holding hands, we'll fall
Hands, we'll fall

[Outro]
When I'm around you
When I'm around you
I don't feel together
I don't feel together
When I'm around you (Together)
When I'm around you (Together)
I don't feel together, no (Together)
I don't feel together (Together)
