[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Mama, take this badge off of me
I can’t use it anymore
It’s gettin' dark, too dark to see
Feels like I’m knockin' on heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

[Verse 2]
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can’t shoot them anymore
That long, black cloud is comin' down, yeah, yeah
Feels like I’m knockin' on heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door, yeah, yeah
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh
Thank you
