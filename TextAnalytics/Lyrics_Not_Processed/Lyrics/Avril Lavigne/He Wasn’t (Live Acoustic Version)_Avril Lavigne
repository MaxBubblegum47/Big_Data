[Verse 1]
There's not much goin' on today
I'm really bored, it's gettin' late
What happened to my Saturday?
Monday's comin', the day I hate

[Pre-Chorus]
Sit on my bed alone
Starin' at the phone

[Chorus]
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm lookin' for

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-uh

[Verse 2]
This is when I start to bite my nails
And clean my room when all else fails
I think it's time for me to bail
This point of view is gettin' stale

[Pre-Chorus]
Sit on my bed alone
Starin' at the phone

[Chorus]
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm lookin' for

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh


[Bridge]
Na, na, na-na-na
We've all got choices
Na, na, na-na
We've all got voices
Na, na, na-na-na
Stand up, make some noise
Na, na, na-na
Stand up, make some noise

[Pre-Chorus]
I sit on my bed alone
Starin' at the phone

[Chorus]
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
He isn't really what I'm lookin' for
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no
He wouldn't even open up the door
He never made me feel like I was special
Like I was special, 'cause I was special

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh

[Outro]
Na, na, na-na-na
