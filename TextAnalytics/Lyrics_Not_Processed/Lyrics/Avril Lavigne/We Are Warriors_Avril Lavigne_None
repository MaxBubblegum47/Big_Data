[Verse 1]
We'll pick our battles 'cause we know we're gonna win the war (Win the war)
We're not rattled 'cause we shattered all of this before (This before)
Steadier than steel 'cause we're ready with a shield and sword (Shield and sword)
Back on the saddle 'cause we've gathered all our strength for more (Strength for more)

[Pre-Chorus]
And we won't bow, we won't break
No, we're not afraid to do whatever it takes
We'll never bow, we'll never break

[Chorus]
'Cause we are warriors, we'll fight for our lives
Like soldiers all through the night
And we won't give up, we will survive
We are warriors
And we're stronger, that's why we're alive
We will conquer, time after time
We'll never falter, we will survive
We are warriors

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
We are warriors

[Verse 2]
Like vikings, we'll be fighting through the day and night (Day and night), ah-oh
We'll be marching through the darkness 'til the morning light (Morning light)
Even when it's harder, like the armor, you will see us shine (See us shine)
No, we won't stop and we won't drop until the victory's ours (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
No, we won't bow, we won't break
No, we're not afraid to do whatever it takes
We'll never bow, we'll never break

[Chorus]
'Cause we are warriors, we'll fight for our lives
Like soldiers all through the night
And we won't give up, we will survive
We are warriors
And we're stronger, that's why we're alive
We will conquer, time after time
We'll never falter, we will survive
We are warriors (Oh)

[Bridge]
Oh, you can't shoot us down
You can't stop us now
We've got a whole damn army
Oh, you can't break us down
You can't take us out
This'll be behind us

[Chorus]
We are warriors, we'll fight for our lives
Like soldiers all through the night
And we won't give up, we will survive
We are warriors
And we're stronger, that's why we're alive (We are stronger)
I'll conquer, time after time (We will conquer)
We'll never falter, we will survive (Never falter)
We are warriors (We are warriors)

[Outro]
Woah, woah, woah
We are warriors
Woah, woah, woah
We are warriors
