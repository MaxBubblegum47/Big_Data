[Verse 1]
Excuse me sir, do I have your attention?
There’s something if you don’t mind, I’d like to mention
So open those ears, sit your butt down and shut your mouth up
I’m aware that it’s hard for you to do that
All I ask is lay down, put your feet up
Now soak in, pay attention, learn a lesson loud and clear

[Chorus]
Hey, you’re a dirty liar
You wrung me out for something I thought was right
I wanted to be left alone
Not shown around like your golden prize
Oh, I looked around
Look what happened, you found out
You never satisfy me

[Verse 2]
Never trusted anyone in the first place
You turned me up, you're disgusting anyway
Hear that music, crank it up
Is there something familiar in the singer's voice?
Turn it down, now listen to me
What made you think you were my authority?
I’m awake, finally now I’m able to move on (just gotta tell the truth)

[Chorus]
Hey, you’re a dirty liar
You wrung me out for something I thought was right
I wanted to be left alone
Not shown around like your golden prize
Oh, I looked around
Look what happened, you found out
You never satisfy me

[Bridge]
Now, do these words stick to you? Hope they do
Think about it, think about it
Stick to you like superglue, keep you from the things you do

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Hey, you’re a dirty liar
You wrung me out for something I thought was right
I wanted to be left alone
Not shown around like your golden prize
Oh, I looked around
Look what happened, you found out...

[Chorus]
Hey, you’re a dirty liar
You wrung me out for something I thought was right
I wanted to be left alone
Not shown around like your golden prize
Oh, I looked around
Look what happened, you found out
You never satisfy me
