[Verse 1]
It's the first time I ever felt this lonely
Wish someone would cure this pain
It's funny when you think it's gonna work out
'Til you chose weed over me, you're so lame
I thought you were cool until the point
Up until the point you didn't call me when you said you would
Finally figured out you're all the same
Always comin' up with some kinda story

[Chorus]
Every time I try to make you smile
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You can't, you're too tough
You think you're loveless
Is that too much that I'm askin' for?

[Verse 2]
Thought you'd come around when I ignored you
Sort of thought you'd have the decency to change
But babe, I guess you didn't take that warning
'Cause I'm not about to look at your face again

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you see that you lie to yourself?
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won't be too late when the smoke clears
'Cause I, I am still here

[Chorus]
But every time I try to make you smile
You'd always go off feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You'd stand like a stone
Alone in your zone
Is that too much that I'm askin' for?

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't find where I am
Lyin' here alone in fear
Afraid of the dark
No one to claim, alone again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you see that you lie to yourself?
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won't be too late when the smoke clears
'Cause I, I am still here

[Chorus]
Every time I try to make you smile
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You can't, you're too tough
You think you're loveless
It was too much that I asked him for
