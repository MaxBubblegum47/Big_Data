[Intro][x2]
Hey yeah

[Verse 1]
I will move
My little self o-o-on
It won't be
Very much longer
One day soon
He will find me
I know this
Because I believe

(La la la la la la)

[Verse 2]
If I get
To know myself better
I will be
A little bit stronger
I won't forget
Everything you told me
Yeah I miss
The way you'd hold me
The words you told me

[Chorus]
Things happen for a reason
You'll become a stronger person
When life tears you up
Then you'll understand
It's never easy
But you know when you get there
As it tears you down
It builds you up
Well it builds you up
(La la la la la la)

[Verse 3]
Some girls fall
Just like I did
They break our hearts
I shoulda broke his
Get yourself up
Strut along further
My advice
You can do better
Just say whatever

[Chorus]
Things happen for a reason
You'll become a stronger person
When life tears you up
Then you'll understand
It's never easy
But you know when you get there
As it tears you down
It builds you up
Well it builds you up
It builds you up

[Verse 4]
Well you said you would love me forever
Well blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
You should maybe watch what you're saying
Wha-a-at
Wha-a-at
Wha-at

[Chorus]
Things happen for a reason
You'll become a stronger person
When life tears you up
Then you'll understand (Understand)
It's never easy
But you know when you get there
As it tears you down
It builds you up
Things happen for a reason
You'll become a stronger person
When life tears you up
Then you'll understand (Understand)
It's never easy
But you know when you get there
As it tears you down
It builds you up

[Outro]
(Builds you u-up)
It builds you up
(Builds you u-up)
It builds you u-u-up
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
