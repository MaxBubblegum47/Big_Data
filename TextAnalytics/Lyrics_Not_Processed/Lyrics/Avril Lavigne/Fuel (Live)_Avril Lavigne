[Intro]
Give me fuel, give me fire
Give me that which I desire, uh!

[Verse 1]
Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crash my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
A hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em man, white-knuckle tight
Through black and white

[Chorus]
Ooh, on I burn
Fuel is pumpin' engines
Burnin' hard, loose and clean
(Ooh) And I burn, churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So give me fuel, give me fire
Give me that which I desire

[Verse 2]
Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Take the corner, join the crash
Headlights, outlines
Another Junkie lives too fast
Yeah, lives way too fast (Fast), fast (Fast), fast (Fast), oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, on I burn
Fuel is pumpin' engines
Burnin' hard, loose and clean
(Ooh) And I burn, churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
Give me fuel, give me fire
Give me that which I desire, uh, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, on I burn, churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
Give me fuel, give me fire
Give me that which I desire

[Outro]
On I burn!
