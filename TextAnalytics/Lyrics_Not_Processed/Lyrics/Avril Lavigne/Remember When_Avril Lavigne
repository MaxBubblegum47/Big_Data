[Verse 1]
Remember when I cried
To you a thousand times?
I told you everything
You know my feelings
It never crossed my mind
That there would be a time
For us to say goodbye
What a big surprise

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not lost
I'm not gone
I haven't forgot

[Chorus]
These feelings I can't shake no more
These feelings running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when

[Verse 2]
I remember when
It was "Together 'til the end"
Now I'm alone again
Where do I begin?
I cried a little bit
You died a little bit
Please say there's no regrets
And say you won't forget

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not lost
And I'm not gone
I haven't forgot

[Chorus]
These feelings I can't shake no more
These feelings running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when

[Bridge]
That was then, now it's the end
I'm not coming back, I can't pretend
Remember when

[Chorus]
These feelings I can't shake no more
These feelings running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
