[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

[Verse 1]
You're so fine, I want you mine, you're so delicious
I think about you all the time, you're so addictive
Don't you know what I could do to make you feel alright? (Alright, alright)
And don't pretend, I think you know I'm damn precious
And hell yeah, I'm the motherfuckin' princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I'm right (I'm right)

[Pre-Chorus]
She's like so whatever
You could do so much better
And I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talkin' about

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

[Verse 2]
Well, I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away, I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time, again and again
Again, again, again
So come over here and tell me what I wanna hear (So come over here)
Better yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again
And again and again and again

[Pre-Chorus]
Because she's like so whatever
And you could do so much better
And I think we should get together now
And that’s what everyone’s talkin' about

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

[Bridge]
In a second, you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinkin'?
Boom shakalaka-laka-laka-laka finger (Uh)
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you think—
Hey, hey, hey
No way, no way
Hey, hey, hey
No way, no way

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
I don't like your girlfriend
No way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, well, I could be your girlfriend
No way
Hey, hey (Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me)
No way (No way, no way, you know it's not a secret)
Hey, hey (Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend)
No way, no way
Hey, hey
