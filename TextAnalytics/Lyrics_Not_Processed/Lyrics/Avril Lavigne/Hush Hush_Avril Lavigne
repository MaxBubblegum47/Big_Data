[Intro]
Hush, hush
Shh
Hush, hush

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to kiss you
You didn't mean to fall in love
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant for it to mean this much
Hush, hush, now
I wanted to keep you
Forever next to me
You know that I still do
And all I wanted was to believe
Hush, hush, now

[Chorus]
So go on, live your life
So go on, say goodbye
So many questions, but I don't ask why (But I don't ask why)
So this time, I won't even try
Hush, hush now

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm
Hush, hush now

[Verse 2]
When I try to forget you
I just keep on rememberin'
What we had, it was so true
And somehow we lost everything
Hush, hush, now (Hush, hush, now)

[Chorus]
So go on, live your life
So go on, say goodbye
So many questions, but I don't ask why, no (But I don't ask why)
So go on, live your life
So go on, and say goodbye
So many questions, but I don't ask why (But I don't ask why)
Maybe someday, but not tonight
Hush hush, now

[Post-Chorus]
(Hush hush, now)
(Hush hush, now)

[Bridge]
Don't, don't, don't you ever say a word, word
Of what you ever thought you heard, heard
Don't you ever tell a soul what you know
I tried to hide, but I still believe
We, that we were always meant to be, be
And I could never let you go, no
Hush, hush, now

[Chorus]
So go on, live your life
So go on, say goodbye
So many questions, but I don't ask why, no (But I don't ask why)
So go on, live your life
So go on, and say goodbye
So many questions, but I don't ask why (But I don't ask why)
Maybe someday, but not tonight
Hush, hush, now

[Outro]
Mmm
Hush, hush, now
Mmm
Hush, hush
Shh
