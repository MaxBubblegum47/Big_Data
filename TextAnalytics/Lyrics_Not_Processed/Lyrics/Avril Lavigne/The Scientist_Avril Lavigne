[Verse 1]
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
And tell you I set you apart

[Verse 2]
Tell me your secrets, And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles, Coming up tails
Heads on a silence apart

[Verse 3]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

[Verse 4]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

[Verse 5]
And tell me you love me, Come back and hold me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, Chasing tails
Coming back as we are

[Verse 6]
Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

[Outro]
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
