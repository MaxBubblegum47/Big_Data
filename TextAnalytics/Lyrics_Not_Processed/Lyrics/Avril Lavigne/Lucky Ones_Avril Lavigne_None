[Verse 1]
It used to be you and I driving on a cold november night
It used to be you and I talking to the middle of the night
We didn't know much about anything
Just knew that it felt right
It used to be you and I laughing and I can't remember why

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it's just me getting take out for one
Thinking about how you said it would always be us

[Chorus]
How'd we let the ship go down
Said we that were on solid ground
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the Lucky Ones
Maybe we were just too young
Maybe it was all just for fun
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the Lucky Ones

[Verse 2]
I'm picking up the pieces of the puzzle
I guess I misunderstood
And no one said love is forever
Oh but damn it felt so good

[Pre-Chorus]
So whys it just me here alone on the couch
Where we sat and you told me our love would never run out

[Chorus]
How'd we let the ship go down
Said we that were on solid ground
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the Lucky Ones
Maybe we were just too young
Maybe it was all just for fun
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the Lucky Ones

[Bridge]
And i don't know whats under stones
And I don't know what is love
But we ere in in the middle of a storm
And I thought we were the Lucky Ones

[Chorus]
How'd we let the ship go down
Said we that were on solid ground
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the Lucky Ones
Maybe we were just too young
Maybe it was all just for fun
No one ever stays in love
I thought we were the Lucky Ones
I Thought we were the Lucky Ones
I Thought we were the Lucky Ones
