[Verse 1: Takahiro Moriuchi]
You always call me full of regret
You want me to save you again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2: Taka]
All these years, the days go by
I've seen you fall a million times
Everybody makes mistakes

[Verse 3: Avril Lavigne]
It feels so hard to watch you hurt
From the pain, a lesson learned
This is how you find your way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3: Taka]
It feels so hard, I’ve been there too
Sky so dark, no way through
Stories only scars can tell

[Verse 4: Avril Lavigne]
I've go so much love for you, my friend
Ride or die until the end
But only you can save yourself

[Chorus: Taka & Avril Lavigne]
You just have to listen, listen
I hope that you know
Listen, listen
I won't let you go
I wish you I could save you from the pain you’ve been through
And all I can tell you is the best thing to do
You've gotta listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
To your heart

Listen, listen
Listen, listen

Listen, listen hitotsudake
Listen, listen Shinjiyou
Furi yamanai ame nado nai

And all I can tell you is the best thing to do
(You gotta)
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
To your heart

To your heart
Listen, listen
To your heart
