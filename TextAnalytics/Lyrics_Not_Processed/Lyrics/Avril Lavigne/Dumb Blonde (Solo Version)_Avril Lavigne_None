[Chorus]
I ain't no dumb blonde
I ain’t no stupid Barbie doll
I got my game on
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

[Verse 1]
Well, there you go again tellin' me where I belong
You put me on the bench, don't think that I can play strong
So quick to condescend, well, you think I’m empty, I'm not
It won't be no accident when I'm crushin' you from the top (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a babe, I'm a boss and I'm makin’ this money (Uh-huh)
I can flip like a switch and I cut like a blade (Try to get it now)
I can sting like a bee, but I’m sweeter than honey (Uh-huh)
And I'm quick as a whip so get outta my way (Come and get it now)

[Chorus]
I ain’t no dumb blonde
I ain't no stupid Barbie doll
I got my game on
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
I ain't no dumb blonde
I am a fucking cherry bomb
I'll be your icon
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

[Post-Chorus]
Stand up everybody
Get up, say it loud
We’re bombshells raisin' hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
Stand up everybody
Get up, say it loud
We're bombshells raisin' hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

[Verse 2]
Well, there you go again, you're talkin' down on me
I may look innocent, don't underestimate me
I'm gold, I'm platinum, don't you know I'm outta your league?
I'm gonna count to ten then I want you down on your knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a babe, I'm a boss and I'm makin' this money (Uh-huh)
I can flip like a switch and I cut like a blade (Try to get it now)
I can sting like a bee, but I'm sweeter than honey (Uh-huh)
And I'm quick as a whip so get outta my way (Come and get it now)

[Chorus]
I ain't no dumb blonde
I ain't no stupid Barbie doll
I got my game on
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
I ain't no dumb blonde
I am a fucking cherry bomb
I'll be your icon
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

[Post-Chorus]
Stand up everybody
Get up, say it loud
We're bombshells raisin' hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
Stand up everybody
Get up, say it loud
We're bombshells raisin' hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

[Bridge]
If you're a strong bitch, then bring it on, bitch
Then sing along if you don't take no shit
When it gets fucked up, don't ever shut up
You gotta stand up and fight for it
If you're a strong bitch, then bring it on, bitch
Then sing along if you don't take no shit
When it gets fucked up, don't ever shut up
You gotta stand up and fight for it

[Chorus]
I ain't no dumb blonde
I ain't no stupid Barbie doll
I got my game on
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
I ain't no dumb blonde
I am a fucking cherry bomb
I'll be your icon
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong

[Post-Chorus]
Stand up everybody
Get up, say it loud
We're bombshells raisin' hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
Stand up everybody
Get up, say it loud
We're bombshells raisin' hell now
Watch me, watch me, watch me prove you wrong
