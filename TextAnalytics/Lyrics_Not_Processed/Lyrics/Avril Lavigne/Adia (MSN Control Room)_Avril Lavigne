[Verse 1]
Adia, I do believe I failed you
Adia, I know I've let you down
Don't you know I've tried so hard
To love you in my way?
It's easy, let it go
Adia, I'm empty since you left me
I'm tryin' to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone
To see where we went wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no one left to finger
There's no one here to blame
There's no one left to talk to, honey
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence

[Chorus]
'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
But does it matter?

[Verse 2]
Adia, I thought that we could make it
I know I can't change the way you feel
I leave you with your misery
A friend who won't betray

[Pre-Chorus]
I pull you from your tower
I take away your pain
Show you all the beauty you possess
If you'd only let yourself believe

[Chorus]
That we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
But does it matter?

[Chorus]
We are born innocent
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
But does it matter?

[Chorus]
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
But does it matter?
