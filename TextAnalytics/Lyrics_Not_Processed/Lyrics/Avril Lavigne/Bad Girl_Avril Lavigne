[Intro: Marilyn Manson]
Just lay your head in daddy’s lap, you’re a bad girl
Bad girl!
One, two, three, four!

[Verse 1: Avril Lavigne]
Hey, hey
I'll let you walk all over me, me
You know that I’m a little tease, tease
But I want it pretty please, please
You know (You know, you know) I’m crazy
I just wanna be your baby
You can fuck me, you can play me
You can love me or you can hate me

[Refrain: Avril Lavigne]
Miss me, miss me, now you wanna kiss me

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & (Marilyn Manson)]
Choke me, 'cause I said so
Stroke me, and feed my ego
I’ve been a bad girl, don’t you know?
(Don’t tell me what to do!)
Come get it, now or never
I’ll let you do whatever
I’ll be your bad girl, here we go
(One, two, three, four)

[Refrain: Avril Lavigne & (Marilyn Manson)]
Miss me, miss me, now you wanna kiss me (You're a bad girl)

[Verse 2: Avril Lavigne & (Marilyn Manson)]
Baby, you know I want a little taste, taste
So let me take you all the way, way
You know you’ll never be the same, same (You fuckin' bad girl!)
One night, you won’t forget the rest of your life
So come on over to the wild side
Buckle up, and baby, hold on tight

[Refrain: Avril Lavigne]
Miss me, miss me, now you wanna kiss me
We both know that you love me 'cause I'm so bad

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & (Marilyn Manson)]
Choke me, 'cause I said so
Stroke me, and feed my ego
I’ve been a bad girl, don’t you know?
(Don’t tell me what to do!)
Come get it, now or never
I’ll let you do whatever
I’ll be your bad girl, here we go
(One, two, three, four)

[Bridge: Avril Lavigne & (Marilyn Manson)]
I've been a bad girl
I've been a bad girl
I'll be your bad girl (Bad girl)
I'll be your bad girl (Bad girl)
I've been a bad girl (Bad, bad, bad, bad)
I've been a bad girl (Bad, bad, bad)
I'll be your bad girl (Bad, bad, bad, bad)
A fucking bad girl! (Bad, bad, bad)
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & (Marilyn Manson)]
Choke me, 'cause I said so (Bad girl)
Stroke me, and feed my ego (Bad girl)
I’ve been a bad girl, don’t you know?
(Don’t tell me what to do!)
Come get it now or never (Bad, bad, bad girl)
I’ll let you do whatever (Bad, bad, bad girl)
I’ll be your bad girl, here we go
(One, two, three, four)

[Outro: Marilyn Manson & (Avril Lavigne)]
Bad, bad, bad girl
(Ha-ha-ha-ha)
