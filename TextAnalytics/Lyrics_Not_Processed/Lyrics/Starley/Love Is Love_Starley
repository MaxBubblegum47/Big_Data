[Verse 1]
You asked me if it's your fault
For letting me play with trucks when I was younger
And then you went on to say
How will I break these news to your mother

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say you cried for three days straight, daddy
And I don't understand it
'Cause loving her, it ain't an illness
Since she makes me happy
We've got to hold one another
We've got to hold on real tight
You know we only have each other
As long you open up your eyes
'Cause love is love, oh
'Cause love is love

[Chorus]
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love

[Verse 2]
Today I'm flying home
I haven't seen my family in forever
And the last time that we spoke
You said music's changed me enough for the better

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say you cried for three days straight, daddy
And I don't understand it
'Cause loving her, it ain't an illness
Since she makes me happy
We've got to hold one another
We've got to hold on real tight
You know we only have each other
As long you open up your eyes
'Cause love is love, oh
'Cause love is love

[Chorus]
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love

[Bridge]
I don't remember when I realized
My life had changed forever, I
Ooh, I can't live a lie, mmh
You say why can't it be a man
Why can't I learn to live in God's plan
'Cause two women aren't supposed to kiss and hold hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember when you told me daddy
If they don't understand me
Then don't go changing who I am
Just 'cause it makes them happy
We've got to hold one another
We've got to hold on real tight
You know we only have each other
So won't you open up your eyes
'Cause love is love, oh
'Cause love is love

[Chorus]
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love
Love is, love is love
(Love is love, Love is love)
