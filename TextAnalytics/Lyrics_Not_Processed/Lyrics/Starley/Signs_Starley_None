[Verse 1]
Oh God
It's the same old song
If I was smart I'd run
But that would be so dumb
Cause oh Lord
Whenever you're near me
Your mouth is poetry and I start to believe
In love, just you and me
I tell my friends bout what we could be
But the signs you've given aren't clear
It gets a little crazy around here
Cause I

[Chorus]
I don't want to be the one who says it first
And I don't want to be out here looking so thirsty
And now all I'm sure of this thing fucking hurts
You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine
The signs
You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine

[Verse 2]
Over
And over again now
Reliving all my fears
Wondering why I'm here
Laying in your bed sheets
With nothing else between
But a bunch of question marks
Promises in the dark
We focus
You and me
I tell my friends 'bout what we could be
But the signs you've given aren't clear
It gets a little crazy around here
Cause I

[Chorus]
I don't want to be the one who says it first
And I don't want to be out here looking so thirsty
And now all I'm sure of this thing fucking hurts
You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine
The signs
You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine
The signs
You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine
The signs
You say so much when you're high
But it's not enough to know you're mine
