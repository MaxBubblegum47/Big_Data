I'mma turn my headphones up
And fly away , blast of to the stars
Cause i don't wanna think
When i feel the hope is gone
He knows my pain (Uh!)
Can you help me , (Yeah!) to (uh-uh-uh) live with me , today
Today , today i wanna fly away (Uh!)
Today (Yeah!) , today (uh-uh-uh) i wanna fly away

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Wish that i could fly , fly away
Looking for a brighter day , a brighter day
Run Away from yesterday , yesterday
And take all of my Ghetto boys and girls with me
And , even if we don't know when we're in a race
And put a big smile on our mama face
F-Fly away , flying down the Highway
Livin' in the moment , with my shawty right beside me
Touch the sky up , take it higher
Way up till we floating , we let everybody know
That we go make it righter , make it righter , oh yeah
Today !

[Hook: Nelly Furtado]
I'mma turn my headphones up
And fly away , blast of to the stars
Cause i don't wanna think ( I don't wanna)
When i feel the hope is gone
He knows my pain
Can you help me , to live with me , today
Today , today i wanna fly away
Today , today i wanna fly away

[Verse 2: Nelly]
(Let's go !)
I wish that i could hit the block , chillin' with the Homies
Posted on the corner , with no cops checking on us
Take everybody that's with our houses and make a monastery
Health , care , i swear , i do it right now
Tell every boy that had a father at home
If i could i would make you my own
No single women should have to raise you alone
Gimme you're hand , yeah understand together we can
Touch the sky up , take it higher
Way up till we floating , we let everybody know
That we go make it righter , make it righter , oh yeah
Today !

Cause i don't wanna think ( I don't wanna)
When i feel the hope is gone
He knows my pain
Can you help me , to live with me

[Verse 3: Nelly Furtado]
Oh
And I'mma turn my Headphone
Never turn his head hurt
I'm flying Awa-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
I'm flying Awa-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
They can't stop you (can't stop you no !)
They can't drop you (drop you down ! )
I'mma turn his Headphones up and fly away !
