[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus]
Shawty made that ass clap, she don't need no applause
High fashion like Goyard
G-Wagon or the Rover?
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go, go, go
Drop that ass to the floor-floor, yeah
Ahh, woah
You ain't gotta deal with none of these niggas no more

[Post-Chorus]
If we hop in the Benz is that okay?
Is it okay if I call you my Prada bae?
I ain't no player, I just got a lot of baes
But let me tell you, I like you a lot, bae
I wanna start at the top and the bottom, bae
Know you want the shoe with the red at the bottom, bae
You know I like when you ride at the top, bae

[Verse 1]
She want Chane'-ne' and Dio'-o'
I'm only doin' cash out, I don't need promo
I pull up to the high rise, I'm in the four-four
Inside cocoa
If I got a feeling, I keep it inside my heart
And I keep a Patek, too, 'cause I don't do facades
You see my diamonds even when I'm in the dark
And since you got it, it make you go and do anything you want to

[Chorus]
Shawty made that ass clap, she don't need no applause (No applause)
High fashion like Goyard (Like Goyard)
G-Wagon or the Rover? (Skrrt)
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart (Ooh-ooh)
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go, go, go (Shawty on go, go, yeah)
Drop that ass to the floor-floor, yeah
Ahh, woah
You ain't gotta deal with none of these niggas no more

[Post-Chorus]
If we hop in the Benz is that okay?
Is it okay if I call you my Prada bae?
I ain't no player, I just got a lot of baes
But let me tell you, I like you a lot, bae
I wanna start at the top and the bottom, bae
Know you want the shoe with the red at the bottom, bae
You know I like when you ride at the top, bae

[Verse 2]
If I hit it from the back, she gon' hit the sidewalk
If she got a best friend with her, take her back to my loft
Got her five in the mornin', wildin', wildin'
And her name ain't Megan but she a stallion, stallion
Never keep my hoes divided, 'member I was pullin' up in the valley
And you know I take her soul when she ridin'
Sweater and her sneakers all Kenzo
Shawty know to drop it low like a limbo every time we kick it like Timbo, woah, woah, woah

[Bridge]
Shawty made that ass clap, she don't need no applause (Nah, nah)
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart (Ooh-ooh)
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go, go, go (Yeah)
Drop that ass to the floor-floor, yeah

[Chorus]
Shawty made that ass clap, she don't need no applause
High fashion like Goyard
G-Wagon or the Rover?
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go, go, go
Drop that ass to the floor-floor, yeah
Ahh, woah
You ain't gotta deal with none of these niggas no more

[Post-Chorus]
If we hop in the Benz is that okay?
Is it okay if I call you my Prada bae?
I ain't no player, I just got a lot of baes
But let me tell you, I like you a lot, bae
I wanna start at the top and the bottom, bae
Know you want the shoe with the red at the bottom, bae
You know I like when you ride at the top, bae
