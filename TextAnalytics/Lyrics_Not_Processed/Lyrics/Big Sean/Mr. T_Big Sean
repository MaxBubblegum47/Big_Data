Temptation...

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Man I try I tried and I tried again
But the weed and the hoes the Coke and the Hen
All seem to know that I'm gon' give in
If my girl find out — one more 'gain
That I'm 'nikcuf around through her or her friends (what?)
Then she gon' leave like leaves in the winter
Meaning she cold
She hear about me and the twins that had on the twin skirts
Hit squirt hit the purp
And that bitch had the nerve to call out my name when my girl hit my chirp
"Hello?" Oh — that's just my cousin Kim
Her and her friends stopped by for a min
"Nigga, you over there lying AGAIN?!"
Damn. I know she ain't finna believe
She's fixing to leave
Cause Mr. T

Temptation...

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I'm at home where the drama is grown as hell
And I'm still in my mama crib, ain't on no scholar shit
So it's no scholarships, man
But I do want some Prada shit, damn
That's when one of my mans
Came at me with an ounce of that yanz
Like "That's 'bout a grand"
But then I remember Mom telling me
Don't be on no corner retailing weed
Ecstasy or whatever it be
Cause that life ain't straight, like L and B
Hard-headed like working at factories
Cause I got in the game like athletes
And a nigga got paid (paid)
'Til the police took away (way) me
Now I'm in the correctional facility
Mama missing me
Cause Mr. T
