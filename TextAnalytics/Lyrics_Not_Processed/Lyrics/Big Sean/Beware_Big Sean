Been a long time since
Someone stepped it up and threw it down like vince
Repping the city we put it down like this
Got the o town with me with a sound like this
Yeah its kid again back with the synonyms
With the lyricism of jigga mixed with a little bit of eminem
Been flowing with the pen
Finna vent see me going off all swerving like i just hit the bend
Seems like the end is never in sight man
I just keep coming back to the mic and
With these dreams of being a rapper burned into my sight damn
Listen to lyrics that's so enticing
Got a little Tyson in me
Yeah I'm feeling like the ricin in me
And they acting like I care bout the advice they give me
Living life with all these vices in me
But I don't want your damn advice and pity
See I've been sitting for a little bit too long and the bench has got me question raising
Like they never signed my boy kapha  and yet he sound amazing
Seems like for a deal you gon need a track with the sirens blazing
We gon get our own A few youngins gunning that rhyme in ways that
Got everyone going flowing it out fast
Something from nothing from all these out casts
Waiting on my crew producing got jakimbo cooking up out back
Couple of singles and yeah we out that
So for now it's back to the lab again
I've been snapping straight from the pad and pen
Man what happened raps going bad I've been
Up late crackin so go and give that a spin
And you know I still rep winnipeg bradley got me pushing upper limits
This one for my mother who just trying to get supper finished
Do it for the haters man your pencil getting duller isnt it
Raps been so black and white I'll put some colour in it
Hit em all hit em fast hit em hard
Hear the fans we be copping the brethren with  the bars
See me Beating on these rappers who never been in a spar
When the fam get hungry leave em deader than Michael myers
For the liars
Just to show em you got it
It Ain't a sprint it's a jog and they getting tired
With the fire been cheffing up grab a dish
Nothing beats a good home cooked flow straight from the kitchen
And it's funny how nobody really cared when it was dreams and wishes
Now I got em all Bruce Jenner you see em switch positions
Lost a few good rappers but others have arisen
And we taking over business with a hit list
