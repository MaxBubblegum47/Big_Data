[Hook: John West]
I ain't got a dollar but I'm feeling like a millionaire
You know that we already there
Ain't got the answers
But I guess I never really cared
You know that we already there

[Verse 1: John West]
We already there
We ready to wear
We been through craziness
But we always come prepared
I feel like Apple stock, feel like Louis Vuitton
I feel like John Legend, mixed with a little Kan
This is our generation, this is our time
We revolutionaries standing on the front line
I always got your back, so now let's get the fame
We taking giant steps, John Coltrane

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Everybody in the world if you hear me now
Put your hands in the air if you with me now
This goes out to the dreamers everywhere (everyday)
You know that we already there

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Big bottles, I deserve the big bottles
Keep that champagne pop, pop, pop, pop
Might just need your goggles
I got good drinks, bad girls
You know opposites attract (you know)
See, I came from the bottom, so what's the opposite of that?
Top shelf, top floor, got a top model with her top off
Got a top chef, making five course
I'm top five, then drop four
Is this the top of the world?
I'm living with the people I die for
If they ain't at the top with you, then you ain't at the top
Boi

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 3: John West]
There is where we're trying to be
Where the road is trying to lead
I'm going to get there even if I should fall
I pick it up and start a new beginning
Moving on I find a way
All I can do is what I do today
Don't you know that we're already there

[Hook + Bridge]
