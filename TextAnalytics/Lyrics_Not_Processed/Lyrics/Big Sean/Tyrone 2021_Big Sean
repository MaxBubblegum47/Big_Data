[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Woo 
(
Murda on the beat, so it's not nice
)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Look, bro, I told you that that girl ain't shit
When you met her, she ain't even have a whip (Whip)
I seen her walkin' up the street the other day
I bust a U and then I went the other way
She want a whole lot and she a broke ho
Her credit fucked up and she don't own nothin'
My nigga, if I was you, I'd change my phone number
And have a bitch answer for me like, "Wrong number"
That girl a problem, pshh
Extra like her mama, pshh
Always in some drama
But, damn, y'all got a daughter, I know this shit ain't easy, just
Take it from me, dawg, just cut your losses
That's why you fuck then cut 'em off before they stalkers
Now that you really wanna leave and shake her off
She gon' chase all your new bitches off

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
'Cause girls like that, they be nothing but trouble
Girls like that, they be up to no good
Girls like that always up in the club
Been with some girls like that, probably more than I should
She singing

[Post-Chorus: Erykah Badu & 
Big Sean
]
Call Tyrone (
Yeah
), call him
But you can't use my phone (
Woah, woah, yeah
)
(
Brrt, brrt, hello?
)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
You, you the type to talk in front of your honor, dishonest (Woah)
For extra child support, made me out to be a monster (You's a)
All the shit I wasted on you, time and commas (Damn)
You don't act like you my girl no more, you act like you my mama
And I'd never date my mama, that's fuckin' disgusting (Ew)
But that's how I feel every single time you touch me (Damn)
I feel like you lying when you ask me, "Do you trust me?" (Do you trust me?)
So I said, "Not to cuff you," now we talk about custody
Man, you holdin' me back, knives to the back (Damn)
I don't even know how to react, I wish I could white you out
You gon' make me go Kodak Black, you had me on tap just like an app (Woah, woah, woah)
Turned around and stunted my growth (No), and I can't adapt to that habitat
Look, look, wonderin' where'd your soul go, with you, that's a no-go (No)
Yeah, I'm not happy as I look inside our photos (Look)
Thought you was my type, but you not even the proto (No way)
With you, nah, I'd rather be solo with no hoes

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign, 
Ty Dolla $ign and Big Sean

'Cause girls like that, they be nothing but trouble
Girls like that, they be up to no good
Girls like that always up in the club
Been with some girls like that, probably more than I should
She singing

[Post-Chorus: Erykah Badu]
Call Tyrone, call him
But you can't use my phone
