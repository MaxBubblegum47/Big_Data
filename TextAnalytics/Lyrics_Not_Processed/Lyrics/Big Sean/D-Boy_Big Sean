[Hook]
I'm coming off the westside, where niggas on the fresh shit
But catch me on the eastside with some bitches you mess can't with
I'm a Detroit Player,
 stacking my paper
Stacking so high need a fucking elevator
I'm a D-Boy, I'm a I'm a D-Boy
I'm a D-Boy, I'm a I'm a D-Boy
I'm a D-Boy, I'm a I'm a D-Boy
I'm a D-Boy, I'm a I'm a D-Boy

[Verse 1: HBK]
I'm a D nigga keep it G nigga
I'm getting it, can't you see nigga
These white Diamonds like a key nigga
But this yellow ice like pee nigga
2 Chainz I'm on three nigga
I'm who your lil brother wanna be nigga
If I'm not in your girl I'm in the street nigga
40 cal don't try to creep nigga
Sleep nigga, you a weak nigga
Dough Boyz is not to be fucked with
She ignorin your calls and playin with my balls
And doin it all while she suck dick
I'm on Sussex on the west side
But my east side bitch rollin with me
I fuck her good and I throw her a fifty
Then drop her off then my soldier with me
I don't trust a soul, cause 
in the D is cold
But not that cold cause I be wearing minks
Tippin hoes when I walk in Sphinx
Your bitch drunk cause I bought the drinks
Give her a wink and I make her smile
Girls wanna fuck cause I be making thous
Top down at Belle Isle, all I'm hearing is bitches yell out
There go Big Sean, there go the kid, them niggas doin it big
They'll take your bitch and show her how life is supposed to be live

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SayItAintTone]
Three Cellphones and them bitches work (I say)
Louis with the Gucci niggas say I'm perpin ( I say)
AK-47 bitch I need a turban (I say)
Lambo on The Lodge bitch you see me SWIRVIN (VROOM)

[Verse 3: Dusty McFly]
Everynight I count up with a cold bitch I must say
RORO with a crushface, my old ho got the crushface
Make the the doe at the day, I can feed the whole hood bitches
How you niggas gettin money and your whole hood snitchin
Don't be watching the television, but it's flats in every room
D-Boy of the year, bitch I got plaques in every room
Got a strap in every room, stacking dough until I'm rich
Couple duffle's double flipped,
 
got them Russians on my dick
I feel like Maserati Rick in '85,
 
Grey Poupon
On my motherfuckin sandwich ho, cuttin up some cantaloupe
While a super bad Spanish bitch kiss on my pinky
Gave her a pink stinky and make her get kinky 
I'm out here!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Man I'm just west-side reppin, bad bitch undressing (do it)
East-side connected, 
holler if you need connections
Boi, I'm fresh up that mille, you know I'm reppin that 7 (yup)
Bought my mom new a crib, to show that she can be alive and see heaven
Fur coat I'm Chewbacca, drunk off Rose and Vodka
Saw them niggas talking shit, so I beat they ass and fuck my new watch up (God damn!)
I'm a Detroit Player
They gon' have to put me next to Barry Sanders and Isaiah
No hand outs, tell these niggas all pay up
Cause they ain't gave me shit when was broke and on the way up
And I made it, cash out, D girl ass out
Hood niggas, army guns bussin like they the Black ops (oh god!)
Your girlfriend love the ride don't she?
With my dick out, I might let her put some miles on it
Got all my leather put some milles on it (swirv)
Say I don't rep the D that's the dumbest shit
You seen them Carties whippin out on 106...(bitch)
