[Verse 1]
Oh yeah you guessed it
Finally Famous in this thing we finessin'
Cartier lenses on me, ain't no questions
In and out of town I ain't slept in
Weeks, you ready?
Look, I've been in and out of town
Still making plays even when I'm out of bounds
Automatic champagne popping never out of rounds
Tell me where the throne, that's where I be sitting down
I run up in your city, run the spot, run the town
Even run that motherfucker when I'm not around
Only time to fuck, not to fuck around
I got weed, bad bitches, and money and they all 100 pounds
God damn, I am, from pots/pans
Turn that shit straight to hot sand
Yeah I got the blueprint these niggas try and trace
They tell me slow down but I'm in the human race
And I be damned if I ain't first, never living in reverse
I just hit it from reverse, swear that shit so crazy
Man L.A. girls so crazy
How's it sunny if them hoes stay shady
And New York bitches screaming "Fuck you pay me."
In ATL they be eating all the gravy
In Detroit man those girls so gangster
In Philly I've seen some pretty faces
Look, I love it when she up and down the pole
Make me want to take your ass up and down the coast
Have you ever been Annapol where they champagne sipped
Then fly across the border to the 416
Then go up to Philly where they know that shit legit
One time for the hood man you know that we the shit
Come through in the city and you know I eat Philly
And you know I'm repping Philly man shoutout to Meek Milly
I be going in this bitch until I'm silly

[Verse 2]
Dreamchasers what up though?
It's that finally famous boy
You know we out here repping since day one
Look, I got a lot on my mind
I got more on my face
If I ain't going to get it
That day is going to waste
I'm trying to move in my safe
Like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat but these hoes stay on the steakout
Oh you know it's official when I go bringing that Bape out
I'm looking through the magazines like this the girl I'm about to take out
One time for Detroit, yeah you know that's what stay out
Yeah you know plotting up in there to find a way way out
Find a way way out we had to fire way way out
Music been bumping man we just waiting to break out
This the player you've heard of
The young and assertive
I came from the dirt up and
Did the unheard of
Hoes say I'm the man, uh-huh I concur it
I'm young and perverted
If I don't get the pussy or the payment, what the fuck is the purpose?
No calling my phone unless you the fam or my girl I'll just say it's no service
Stay connected as cursive

[Verse 3]
Live life, get high, change the world
Man do it all before you go
In Europe riding Europeans so it's not a foreign O
They like show me the moves, no time for a tutorial
They're is levels to the game, like who put this shit on story mode?
His story historical
Mr. Anderson, I know Sway ain't got the answers so I'm looking for the oracle
All my favorite rappers told me life's a bitch
So I'mma fuck the world through the glory hole
So that bitch can't take me to the Maury show
If she don't smoke weed, pop pills, suck *Tss*
If it's one thing that I hate, man it's boring hoes
All my girls love me
So if I die today it be like 5,011 something freaks at the memorial
Lil bitch
I hop up on the beat like it's the 08 me
When we was riding for D boy no AC
Headed to the game for okay seats
Now it's courtside at OKC
I know KD
And all these singer girls know me like do-re-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but doe come first
No late fees
Kool-Aid smile, colgate teeth
The bigger that I get the more I need shrinks
Woop-woop got a couple screws loose
You was in the winner circle you just trying to get off in the fruit
Fruit Loop
Turn nothing into 2, something into new
I could write a best seller out of alphabet soup

[Verse 4]
Try me, try me
I'mma get this whole motherfucking family
Looking I ain't playing with nobody
I come from 6 mile boy I ain't a Cosby
Understand I came up nigga yeah that's all me
The world is in my palm motherfucker I need palm trees
