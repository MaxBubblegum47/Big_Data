[Intro: Big Sean & Post Malone]
Uh
Yeah, uh, that's right (Yeah)
(Yeah) Uh, yeah, yeah, uh-huh
I was raised by the wolves (I was raised by—)
I was raised by the wolves (I was raised by—)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Post Malone]
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full (I was raised by—)
Run through the night, playin' with your life (I was raised by—)
Go against the pack, that's risking your life (I was raised by—)
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right (Woah, woah)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I got loyalty in blood, I do anything for love
And everything for us (Us, yeah)
Doing everything like everything ain't been too much (I'm too much)
You know my favorite time to come through for you is the clutch
Last second, what a rush (Rush, rush), look
I'm the type to talk to the stars (I look up), straight up
These ain't tattoos, these are scars
My young dogs will tear you and the witnesses apart (Straight up)
They care 'bout starving more than they do 'bout a charge (Woah, woah, woah)
Me, I can't break a commitment (No)
I done seen people fuck up the whole team 'cause they couldn't play they position (Play your position)
Talking 'bout they didn't mean it, bitch, you know the road to hell was paved with good intentions
I see myself in my nemesis (See)
I contemplated forgiveness (No), I think I lost all my innocence (Yeah)
Ho, my life depend on this, this ain't no simple sucker shit (Woah)
Try and steal and you get bit, that's what you motherfucking get
I feel safer taking risks and I can't eat this on my own life
Put my back against the wall just to see how much I've grown, dawg

[Chorus: Big Sean, Post Malone, Big Sean & Post Malone]
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full (I was raised by—)
Run through the night, playin' with your life (I was raised by—)
Go against the pack, that's risking your life (I was raised by—)
Better play it right, better play it right
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full
Run through the night, playin' with your life
Go against the pack, that's risking your life
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
I was raised by the wolves (Wolves), paid all my dues (Dues)
Always in the game and never played by the rules (Rules)
Tried to make me leave (Leave), fell down to my knees (Knees)
Picked myself up and turned my back to the breeze, oh-ohh
Spent a milli' on a Mille, mama look at me (Ooh)
With all these diamond chokers, man, it's gettin' hard to breathe
Thought that you were family, cut some branches off my tree (Wow)
But if you in my circle, know I'll always be around ('Round)
Don't let me down (Down)
You said you'd die for me, well, there's the ground
Ice on my wrist, ice in my veins
But it's a cold, cold world, and you can be predator, you can be prey

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full (Ate 'til they full)
Run through the night, playin' with your life
Go against the pack, that's risking your life (Risking your life)
Better play it right, better play it right
'Cause I was raised by the wolves (By the wolves), ate 'til they full ('Til they full)
Run through the night (Through the night), playin' with your life (With your life)
Go against the pack, that's risking your life (Risking your life)
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right

[Outro: Big Sean, Big Sean & Post Malone, Post Malone]
I was raised by the wolves (I was raised by—)
I was raised by the wolves (I was raised by—)
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full (I was raised by—)
Run through the night, playin' with your life (I was raised by—)
Go against the pack, that's risking your life (I was raised—)
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right (Woo)
