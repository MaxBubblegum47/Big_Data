[Hook]
Uh Man verse by verse
I'mma make these weak niggas disperse
Man I swear verse by verse
I'mma make these weak rappers disperse
Man I'mma get 'em
I'mma get 'em
Watch me get 'em
I'mma get 'em
I'mma get 'em
I'mma get 'em
Watch me get 'em
I'mma get 'em

[Verse]
I'm very instrumental, to any instrumental
You ain't on my level my nigga, even a little
You at the bottom, not even at Malcolm in the middle
You homo ass nigga, (shh) go-N eat some skittles
Now hop up on the rainbow try to reach where I hang though
I'm a little further up then and near the angels
So at your highest point you still wouldn't reach my ankles
You are what you eat but that ain't true cause im anal
? (eww)
And the people show love like a bear hug
I'm here to last, they temporary call em' haircuts
Fair enough I stand behind my balls like a felon does
If you a boss, meet the executor and when it come to paper, meet the editor
A little better brah you need to step, step it up
I'm on my business that's my forte, you?
You beat around the bush like foreplay
And they anticipating me like a court date
So for the bars Im'a charge like the court say
And if the court say they know I did it like OJ (what?)
Then im in the next city like a tour date
There ain't no I in team but it's in I in win
Ain't no "I" in lose but there's an "I" in him
Meaning me meaning moi, so beat the repertoire of the upper echelon
That's high, high in the sky, high to the point that I almost saw God. (Wow)
I stand out from the rest like Yao
But ain't gotta play ball to have you cheering
Perform so well I might as well take a bow
Shitting on these niggas' like a movement from my bowels
People wanna know how if feels in the clouds
But I guess they'll never know cause im never coming down
I started with a dream, added a little faith in
Mixed it with adversity and let it marinate
I put it in the oven for a while and let it bake (yup)
Call it food for thought, put it on your plate
A friend of mighty Motown, home sweet home
Where I roam like a phone in the unknown zone
My niggas roam like a phone in the unknown zone
And we condone a tone a money hoes and clothes
And my record sell like a boat load
Fam you couldn't fill my shoes like bozos
And im solo, cause I herd that what hoes really want is a ring like Frodo. (no)
Coastal, man my nickname postal
Why they local like they old schools
I should beat them like pro tools
Will Farrell nigga started out Oldschool

Uh Man verse by verse
I'mma make these weak niggas disperse
Man I swear verse by verse
I'mma make these weak rappers disperse
Man I'mma get 'em
I'mma get 'em
Watch me get 'em
I'mma get 'em
I'mma get 'em
I'mma get 'em
Watch me get 'em
I'mma get 'em
Note to the world, I made it
I promise I'mma change it
Thank god to my Momma that I'm finally famous
