I feel good
I feel wonderful
And it's because
You made it that way
I feel super spectacular because of you

And now I'm flying
I think I'm floating
I feel so high
Your love leads me to the sky
And if I fall I won't care
Cause I'm safe with you

Cause I'm in love (with your) story
And I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin'(lalalala) I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you

Now baby you the truth so I'm just being honest
You treat me like a king so that's why you my highness
That means queen
Seems I known you for the longest
Funny how we connected on the low like vonage(huh)
And I know it ain't as deep as it could be
Or as it would be but that's how it should be
Cause overtime we gonna be fine like wine
I never put another over mine
See difference between you and them is they just wanna shine and
Well you
You just want Sean
So tell mama sandy, mama myra and that family
That when I get that grammy, they gon' be a granny
And if I see that reaper before you see that reaper
Just know I love you every time you hear me through them speakers and I ain't tryna blow your head up like reefer but we got chemistry to the point we need a
Beaker

So promise that you'll keep me
Promise you won't lead astray
You promise me forever you promise me to stay
So I keep you with my laughter
We're so complete

There's something bout your brown eyes that gets me lost for days
Your touch is like an angel lookin' down with heavens grace
And that's why I'll keep you sheltered from the storm
I
I need you here with me

Cause I'm in love (with your) story
And I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin' I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you

Now listen
First off if it was the last thing
I'll put you first
So you deserve my last name
You make my worst days feel like my birthday
If we never happen we'll regret it in the worst way
Like not seeing the world trade you worth the galaxy baby so let's world trade
And I tend to tell God thank you
Cause baby you a angel
At least from my angle

Cause I'm in love (with your) story
And I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin' I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you
