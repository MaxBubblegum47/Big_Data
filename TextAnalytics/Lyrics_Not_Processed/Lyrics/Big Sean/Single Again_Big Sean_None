[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah, what happens when it's too good to throw away?
You either let it go bad or go away
(I need to pray)

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
Take my time (
Part two
), take my time, I'ma take my time
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Look)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Uh)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I'm single again (Single again)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Uh)
Baby, I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again (Single again)
Told 'em that we better off friends (Off friends)
Blaming you is just so easy (Woah)
But maybe the problem's me
I'm single again (Single again)
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Gon' be)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me (On me)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Instead of blaming all my old girls when I leave (What?)
Instead of calling up these fake hoes that I don't need (What?)
Old relationships turn to new déjà vus
Got me feeling like, "I don't fuck with you"
Oh nah, nah, that's the old me
You fucking with the new me (Yeah)
Honestly, all the disrespect had damn near ruined me (Damn near)
All the trust gone, seems like all you say is, "Prove it to me" (Straight)
And you know I suck at lying, don't, don't do it to me (Don't)
Maybe 'cause my mom had never worked it out with my dad (Damn)
Maybe 'cause he had insecurities and she had 'em back (Uh-huh)
Maybe 'cause single parent love was all I ever had
Who knows? (Who knows?)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, 
Big Sean
]
I'm single again (
Single again
)
Told her we'll be better off friends (
Off friends
)
Maybe I should just focus on me (
On me
)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again (
Single again
)
Told 'em that we better off friends (
Off friends
)
Blaming you is just so easy (
Uh-huh
)
But maybe the problem's me (
Straight up
)
I'm single again (
Single again
)
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (
Yeah, yeah
)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (
On me
)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me

[Post-Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time

[Verse 2: Big Sean & 
Ty Dolla $ign
]
What have you done for yourself?
What have you done for your mental health? 
(Yeah, yeah)
I even tried the drugs and they didn't help
Short term fix, that breaks everything else 
(Oh, oh)
And my bros keep throwing me these random girls in stallions
I need the best advice, went across the street to Khaled 
(Oh)
He said the major key is to be strong on your own
Lose your other half, you're never off balance 
(Oh)
Lookin' for the love in somebody else
That I probably should've gave to myself
Cycles I need to break in myself
If I'm alone, I'm second to no one else, so 
(Yeah)

[Chorus: Big Sean & 
Ty Dolla $ign
]
I'm single again 
(Oh)
Told her we'll be better off friends 
(Better off friends)
Maybe I should just focus on me 
(On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again
Told 'em that we better off friends 
(Oh, yeah)
Blaming you is just so easy 
(Oh)
But maybe the problem's me 
(Ooh)
I'm single again
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be 
(Way)
Maybe I should spend this time on me 
(Way)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me 
(Ooh)

[Post-Chorus: Big Sean]
Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time

[Outro: Big Sean & 
Ty Dolla $ign
]
Yeah
Stay on this grind
(Oh, oh, ayy)
(Dolla $ign)
(Oh)
