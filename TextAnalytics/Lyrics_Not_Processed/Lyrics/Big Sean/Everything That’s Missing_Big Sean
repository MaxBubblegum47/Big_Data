[Intro]
Mainly, whatever the fuck you say means something
That shit is in you
You ain't gotta try that hard
I just want you to know that
(Oh, yeah, yeah, oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
There’s no romancin' without the pain
Just like there's no loss without some gain
Just like there’s no day without a blessin'
Just like no paydays without finessin'
But when who hurt you's forgiven
And all the late nights you been wishin' (Finally pay off)
Finally pay off and go the distance
I pray you get everything you missin'

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Everything you missin', dawg
I pray you get everything you missin'
Everything you missin’
I pray you get everything you missin’
(Oh-oh, oh)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm ’bout to delete my Twitter and follow my intuition
Been in and out the mud, but somеhow I'm in
 
mint condition
I wonder if Granddad would have seen thesе Instagram vixens
Every fifteen minutes, would he had did everything that he did or he didn't?
I wonder how it feel to be rappin'
Swear that’s my fuckin' passion, how it feel to go platinum?
Swear that's my dream, but he too blind to see that
If he doin' what he love in his freetime, then his dream already happened
It's not about the trophy, it's about what it took to grab it
And if you feelin' stagnant, just know you attractin' the energy
That you put out there, you a walkin' magnet
Life can be a struggle, but what isn't that's worth havin'? Huh?

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Dwele]
There's no romancin' without the pain
Just like there's no loss without some gain
Just like there's no day without a blessin'
Just like no paydays without finessin'
But when who hurt you's forgiven
And all the late nights you been wishin'
Finally pay off and go the distance
I pray you get everything you missin'

[Chorus: Big Sean & Dwele]
Everything you missin', dawg
I pray you get everything you missin'
Everything you missin'

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
New life start with a blank canvas
Tryna find yourself, you moved to Lost Angeles
Where the camera's off, you're still not off camera
And that meeting that's supposed to change your life keep getting canceled
Swear my prayers gon' get answered 'fore these execs'll answer
Shit, expenses get too expensive
But you gon' do what it takes to do the digits
Even do the dishes
'Cause you gotta prove to the world how you committed
You got a whole city to inspire
It's so cold in the D, so through they eyes, you on fire
Going platinum once like catching lightning in a bottle
But you do it fifty times
And you realize contracts say a lot between the lines
But through the ups and downs, you make a blueprint that the city can build they own way out
And when they do, it's gon' feel like that you almost did it
And you buy everything you want, but it barely make you different
And find out random bitches can't even compare to commitment
And you learn hearin' doubts doesn't mean you have to listen
And you can't believe how much you made, not money, a difference
And find out everything you had was everything you missin'
