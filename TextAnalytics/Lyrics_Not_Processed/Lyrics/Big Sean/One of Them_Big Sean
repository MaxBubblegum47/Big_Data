[Hook: G-Eazy]
I see that big house, I need one of them
I see that Lambo, I need one of them
I see them PJ's, I need one of them
I see them bad bitches, got tons of them
I see them Rollies, I need one of them
I see them Grammys, I need one of them
I see them millions, I need some of them
See normal people, I'm not one of them
Sorry, sorry, see normal people I'm not one of them

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
The first time I seen that Ferrari in person
I said “yeah, I want that I'm certain”
And this bus pass I’ve got, yeah this shit’s just not working
The world sees me one way
I look in the mirror, see a whole other person
Fuck normal, if you don’t agree, I ignore you
I’m blowing this money, fuck being resourceful
I’m there for more and of course I’ll go get it
I did it, I feel like I walked through a portal
I'm here, I'm winning, bitch look at the scoreboard
I score more, I tour more, think twice
Are you sure you're more popping?
Popping champagne and I pour more
I get what I want and then I, I just want more, more
Yeah, greedy as hell, I’m not satisfied
See now that I have this new status I
Don't even have to try
A villainous mastermind

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I am materialistic
I want all these things that I never had growin' up
Things that I can get now that I got paper
Like her, I take her
I seen them big houses like “I wanna stay there”
Could not have felt it if you’ve never seen
I want to marry Cara Delevingne
My closet is full of that Bape and Supreme
I'm with your girl in my world we're gone off the heen
I want all the dumb shit that money can buy
You're reaching bruh you got no bitches you're dry
You posers you kill me like fuck you just die
What the fuck do you do this for? I wonder why
I cannot fathom, she she's a bad one
With friends with her too damn, I just got to have 'em
Three songs a day every one I'm on spazzing
This shit is not random, I told you

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Straight Up
Started off getting overlooked, man
Turned that shit into overbooked, man
Niggas got problems, niggas got beef
Send it back to ‘em like it's overcooked
Big said its all about the benjis
No other option but to win G
My role model Oprah Winfrey
Going against the team you gon' be win free
I'm on the Indica dominant comma comma
Counting everything except the counterfeit
Even change,
 
yeah niggas say I change
I just take that as a compliment
Thank you very little, plain and simple
I don't think we'll ever, ever, ever fizzle
Got it going up, incremental
Treat a bitch like a rental
Get it to the paper, pen and pencil
Done
