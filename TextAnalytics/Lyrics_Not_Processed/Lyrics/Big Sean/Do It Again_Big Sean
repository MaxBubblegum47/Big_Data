Up all night, I'ma do it again
Yeah I made some mistakes, that a nigga wouldn't change, I'ma do it again
So I hit once, hit twice, so high had to do it again
And I'ma live my motherfucking life like I might not do it again, do it again
Yeah, late night text from my ex. I'ma do it again
Got rich like a bitch one time, I'ma fuck around and do it again
I know I ain't doing what Im supposed to do, but fuck it ima do it again
How you feel? How I feel? Like I made this shit real
And im loving how it feel, Ima motherfuckin do it again

[Verse 1: Earlly Mac]
I guess once wasn't enough so let's do it again
Yeah, run it back again and again
Got damn, man, I should've been on ESPN
Yeah, hit it so many times I had her thinking 'bout myself just fucking her friend
Yeah, arm out the window with the blocka blocka
Then when it's when the ducking begin
I do it whatever the when
Get me the money out your pockets, you don't need it, then I'm out
I ain't gotta give a reason cause I know
Never seen a nigga fix a problem if he broke
If I take a L then that be the day I smoke
Looking at the bitches, I'll take anyone I want
Give me what I need, but please don't give me what I don't
A lot of sex, no stress, not a lot of dates
If she ain't got an ass on it then she out of shape
I love it when I hit it from the back (that's right)
I love it when the lions run it back
 (that's right)
I love it when they give me money back
It's funny how these funny niggas act
Getting money where these funny niggas at
From the front and in the back, where these funny niggas at
From the front and in the back
Now these bitches call me God put 'em on the map
She was falling out with troopers, steady making out with Mac

How you feel? How I feel? Like I made this shit real
And im loving how it feel, Ima motherfuckin do it again

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
You should be motivated but you mad I made it
Aggravated 'til I'm like let's get collaborated
Now you in my face with a fake congratulations
You and girl stood together, oh, I'm glad y'all made it
Yeah, y'all together, but when I walk in it's funny how y'all get decapitated
And the holy matrimony is out the window when she's on my mattress naked
My MasterCard got her masturbatin', got damn, I made it
I'm in the MGM Grand like I own that shit
So much paper I could loan that shit
Fuck that though, I'd rather just Stallone my shit
Jesus piece on, I had to stone that shit
Getting stoned every stuck, every day I do
My old bitches praying that I never, ever say "I do"
Got success, on déjà vu
Sean Michael Anderson is who you make the pay out to
You , you be on the internet straight cyberhating
While I'm up in fur like I'm fucking hibernating
In the cold cold city, where you just gotta make it
Where the people violated then their pupils dilated
Looking like a black eye pea
I swear life's harder with a black ID
So I'mma get that motherfucking white money
Everytime I black out on beats
