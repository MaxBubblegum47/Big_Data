[Intro: Big Sean + Jhene Aiko]
I swear this life was made for us
All these late nights is made for us
Tell the old ones please pray for us
Tell 'em this Sunday to pray for us
I swear this life was made for us
No such thing as getting paid too much
Going all night, please pray for us
Going all night, please pray for us

[Hook: Big Sean]
I guess I gotta get my shit together
I guess, I gotta get it
I guess it's do or die now huh
I guess I'm at the age that I can't try now huh
I guess, I guess, I guess so
I ain't gotta guess no more, I mean
I mean I'm at the age that I can't even try no more
I mean we gotta do it, it ain't even do or die no more

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I woke up early nigga
I had a dream I died at thirty nigga
Aw, twenty something doing real life
To make a million dollars, what it feel like?
It feel like I need to know her right then
It feel like young Ray Allen with the white twins
Popping harder than MJ with the white skin
I take you way back, I'm talking Tommy Hilfiger
Wave cap, way back
Back when we said we need the wrist rocky, ASAP
I had the Casio, time to replace that
Don't make me snap back, back to the TI$A  snapback
Khaled with the flow, you know, they don't want you to snap, yep
Don't make me get the car seat, niggas know I'm they pap, pap
Boy they owe it to me like Leonardo DiCap, facts, yep
Look fresh out of debt, getting spoiled rich
And I'm just tryna spend it all with a loyal bitch
I been choosing wrong girls my whole life
I hope I don't fail the test again
And have her going through my texts again
Religiously, like it's the old testament
Then end up single alone, and stressed again, saying...

[Hook: Big Sean]
I guess I gotta get my shit together
I guess, I guess I gotta get it
I guess it's do or die now huh
I guess I'm at the age that I can't try now huh
I guess, I guess, I guess so
I ain't gotta guess no more, I mean
I mean I'm at the age that we can't try no more
I mean we gotta do it, it ain't even do or die no more

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, thinking to my self what true success is
To some it's to get a job, retire, and move to Texas
I take the path less travelled and give them new directions
I'm still taking more risks than I do suggestions
When I was young I was addicted to the Wrestlemania
Maybe cause I had my back against the ropes
And I grew up Stone Cold just ready to face the Undertaker
I treat my enemies like fuckin' neighbors
Yeah you can borrow the style, and this and that for a while
But trust, I'll be back to fuckin' take it
Then take it back to before it all started adding up
Back when it was happening but wasn't happening fast enough
And the job applications was the only papers stackin' up
And we was contemplating black-masking out the back of trucks, yup
Do you know how it feel, to have no chill?
And love super thick girls with a supermodel feel
And try and do it bigger than everyone around you ever did and ever will
Then put it in your will
It ain't about where you at, boy, it's about where your mind's at
Got my first job and realized I need two hundred times that

[Hook: Big Sean]
I guess I gotta get my shit together
I guess, I guess I gotta get it
I guess it's do or die now huh
I guess I'm at the age that I can't try now huh
I guess, I guess, I guess so
I ain't gotta guess no more, I mean
I mean I'm at the age that I can't even try no more
I mean we gotta do it, it ain't even do or die no more

[Outro: Big Sean + Jhene Aiko]
I swear this life was made for us
All these late nights is made for us
Tell the old ones please pray for us
Tell 'em this Sunday to pray for us
I swear this life was made for us
No such thing as getting paid too much
Going all night, please pray for us
Going all night, please pray for us, oh God
