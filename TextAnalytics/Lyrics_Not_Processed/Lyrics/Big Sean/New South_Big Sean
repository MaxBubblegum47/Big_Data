''New South''- E-fresh ft Karma
E-fresh First Verse
Im rolling through West palm , with my new chick
Now these chickens, wanna be my new chick
Fuck it ima do some crazy shit today
But either way, i know you gonna freaking hate it right
New south, new south, im hot scrotching nigga better cool out
New south, new south, born in Brooklyn
This that new south, 2chainz know what im talking bout
Dj Unk u can just walk it out, alot of dancing
But we will chalk you out, steady riffing in we'll rip your carcass out
Fly talk, fly talk, nigga this that...
Fly south, and i am so fly, i can float on the sidewalk, platinum in my G-shock
Listen to me when i talk
Haters how you feel trick im in your girl's Ipod

Karma's Third verse
They love my swag, they like them tats, where that pretty bone bad, all i really see is cash
I give good brain, and im real so all i talk is facts, and if you in my lane
Im throwing propane light a match, them girls talk shit let em run they mouth
I go in, my goons take you out, pussy so good make a nigga wanna shout, light skin hood
Real bitches shout out, do it for them G's like me, no doubt ,i smoke good green, join the team my scout
Im well thought out, and im here for the drought, the game getting dry, ima show you what im bout
Anyway ima say i do it  alday, i dislike ace, and im rappin dolce, i eat em all up buffet cafe
My bars hit straight, sting ray word play, confuse you dude from the shoes all J's, flow so sick get em out my air way
This pretty chick spit quick like it's doomsday, and i get it like dis, seems like you are late, i dont ever hate
Take you on a date, put you on a plate, baby i an't fake, ima tell you like this, i can let you lick, i like em real thick
