[Hook: Mike Posner]
Now as I seen more money, there's more problems
Every time I look around
They say I'm not hungry and I lost it
But you're never gonna, ever gonna, ever gonna bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me

[Verse One: Big Sean]
Look, I need the best drinks, I love the best hoes
I roll the best weed and blow the best smoke
Mama, they love me from NY head back to Fresno
But they tryna bring your son down like the West Coast
Still instrumental on top of these instrumentals
I can say that we the same, but it's too hard to pretend to
You ain't been through what I been through bitch
(Been through what I been through)
Man, I charge it to the game/It's cool I got my incidentals
Bitch! I'm doin' everything I planned to
I'm with a girl that's just too much for you to handle
My mans will squeeze the handle and put you on a mantel
Respect a nigga doin everything that you can't do, bitch

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Now as I seen more money, there's more problems
Every time I look around
They say I'm not hungry and I lost it
But you're never gonna, ever gonna, ever gonna bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me

[Verse Two: Freddie Gibbs]
D-d-down, yeah clown, another one of them gangsta verses
Woulda put it down sooner but I was out of town
Lookin' fo a couple thangs to purchase
Needed the money for the shopping malls
So I was robbin' dawg, had to snatch chains and purses
Comin' off too thug for the radio cause really though
I just can't restrain from cursin'
Clip for the tips, and a blunt for the skunk
25 to life charged in my trunk
Gotta keep a strap in my city to straight dump
The fo ten turn grown men to straight punks
Turn kings to straight fiends, good girls; straight hoes
Took it to the street wit dope and straight flows
Told 'em that the game is sold and not told
Bag it up and then I'm servin' rocks
Kept my grandma's house so hot
Mo' money, mo' problems dawg
But I'd rather deal with the problems that Puffy got
Don't wanna be strugglin' like my dad
Take a look back at this life I had
The hood I threw up so when I grew up
I knew I'd be Jordan, Michael, Brad

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Now as I seen more money, there's more problems

But you're never gonna, ever gonna, ever gonna bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me
