[Intro: Big Sean]
We got a ten, forty-seven on East 9th Streetet
Oh, it's just
Woah, woah, woah
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Please don't tell my nigga Mike, you know he gon' judge me
Please don't tell my mom, if she find out she won't love me
Last time we did it, we woke up together huggin'
Only question on my mind right now is, "Do you trust me?"
I don't like popping, but I like popping with you though
I don't like to drink, but I like leaning with you though
Sometimes, wonder if your love's the only thing that kill me
Everytime I'm with you, it just feel like I'm the real me (Real, real, real)
That's a damn line like where the ocean and the sky meet (Yeah)
Somewhere in between yeah, baby, that's where you and I meet
Just know I'm a call away (Brr) and I'll be with you night and day

[Chorus: Coldplay, Big Sean]
Let me take you for a joyride, a joyride
Let me take you for a joyride, it's alright
Baby, you can be the highlight of this life (Woah)
Let me take you for a joyride, say, "Oh my God" (Woah)
To make you say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Make you say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Then we going up and down, up and down, up and down, yeah
Going up and down, up and down, up and down, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I need your company, don't make me be alone (Alone)
Tripping off the last joyride you took me on (Oh yeah)
I pull up skrt-skrt, to the front, get ready 'cause I'm coming (Swerve)
Only question on my mind right now is "Do you love me?" (Do you)
I don't like the ZZZs but I'll bar with you though
I don't like the hills, but I'll ride through them with you though
Mood swings, you're going from "I love you" to "I hate you"
Off the show means meditation, get closer to nature
I'm here every time, like when the stars and the sky meet (Damn)
Somewhere in between, yeah, baby, that's where you and I meet
Just know I'm a call away and I'll be with you night and day
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Coldplay, Big Sean]
Let me take you for a joyride, a joyride
Let me take you for a joyride, it's alright (Woah, woah)
Baby, you can be the highlight of this life
Let me take you for a joyride, say, "Oh my God" (Damn, damn)
To make you say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Make you say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Then we going up and down, up and down, up and down, yeah
Going up and down, up and down, up and down, yeah

[Refrain: Big Sean]
Yeah, yeah
Chill out, vibe out, light one, smoke one, ride out (Ride)
Hair down, stretch out, lay out in my hideout (Hide)
We deserve to give each other feelings (Feel)
Skrt with me and we go missing

[Chorus: Coldplay]
Let me take you for a joyride, a joyride
Let me take you for a joyride, it's alright
Baby, you can be the highlight of this life
Let me take you for a joyride, see all my guys (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Big Sean]
Woah, woah, woah
Damn, up and down
Yeah, yeah, yeah
