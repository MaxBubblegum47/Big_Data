It is not good enough, it is not good enough
It is not good enough, it is not good enough
Nah, I was good enough for the shows and good enough to rock 'em
Good enough for people in the projects to college
That bump my shit, say my shit
Not good enough for radio to play my--
Said not good enough for the hood, too hood for Hollywood
Fall back like August,
 figured he probably would
Not good enough to make it, they figured he probably should
Then a couple years later, a nigga all good
Not good enough for her man but good enough for access
Too good for the racks, not good enough for the actress
Looked in the mirror, saw things more clearer
Said I look too good for my bitch not to be the baddest
I work too hard for my nights not to be the gladdest
A little too good just for trying to be average
And when they trying to do what I did
They trying to be big, they ain't good enough for that
My bad
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
Still waiting, scheming on my come-ups
Shooting for the stars, the reason I got my guns up
But maybe my aim off of, maybe I came off
Way too fly they ain't like that, they trying to delay my take off
Can't call it and can't ball if
I'm on this bitch, warning, how should I take all this
Say I ain't good, man you can't call, this that
And ass niggers give me no breaks, keep the Kit-Kats
Listen I been all them places you never been at
Made so many moves and all
Even them Jabbawockee niggers gotta ooh and aah, but in fact
There's no dancing but my hustle's definitely intact
Yeah, but let's put this all in perspective
I compliment this game like Lebron with the nets
And a charm with a necklace - a king, I'm not - respect, miss
Making this a long shot but I'mma all net this
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
It's not good enough, is it not good enough
