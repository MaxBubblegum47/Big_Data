Them yellow diamonds in my chain, yeah, that must mean I'm rich
Them yellow diamonds in my chain, yeah
I got them VVS' flashin' and you know them diamonds brighter than a bitch
You know what we do (Oh, oh yeah) and you know we shinin' so (Oh)
Just watch 'em glitter, glitter, glitter

Just watch us glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter
Just watch it glitter
Glitter

Don't share you with no others, love the money, plus I'm greedy (Bow)
And it's a piece of cake, I say 'cause I'm a pro (Pro)
