[Hook: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Head's in the sky, wings raised and
She's about to fly, and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him, "Trust me"
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing this, he told her, "You won't leave me if you love me"
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out, a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So let's hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the never-end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, "The end, question mark"

[Hook: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Don't let me hold you back, I only hold you back
We're on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby so high
Sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley, straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom, I woulda been the best 'Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know that's very gross, but we getting very close
To our end, though I kill most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

[Hook: Mos Def & Kanye West]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Hook: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
How could you do it? How could you do it?

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay now baby here we go, we go, no baby, me go
You got my heart, baby this what it beat for
I give it all, walk as far as my feet go
What you mean "me go?" Why can't it be "we go"?
What happens when people turn to tears? (huh?)
Dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years, huh?
Been standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish love came with a couple receipts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl, I swear you was a trip, let's make it a couples' retreat
(Do it!) How could my girl do this to me?
Woke up to a note saying "The world did this to me"
Now I'm testing, one-two, reporting live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once, look like they lying in a huddle
But it's not even half the feeling
As hearing your "Seans, you know I love you"
Shedding tears everyday (I know you do)
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask "Why?" sometimes like a fucking vowel
Been hitting trees everyday like a fucking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Of the Phoenix Sun and Nash it out
I mean ash it out so I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now

[Hook: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
