[Intro: Nas]
(Hit-Boy)
N-A-S
Uh, yeah

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
It get kinda hard to replace me (Kinda hard to)
So don't go lookin' for nobody else
I was keeping my heart there on safety (Heart there on)
But now I'm letting it go until ain't none left (Yeah)
You got a lot to lose, but it's all basic
I'll probably ride the times to prevent a late text (I'll probably ride the times)
I bet I'm living it up while so spacey (Bet I'm living it up)
You love to wine and dine, come be my lady, lady

[Verse 1: Nas]
You can't replace me like a battery, you can't mistake 'em for Nasty
You know my anatomy, you know my body is voodoo probably
Kama Sutra, Mr. Oochie Wally
She hit the woah, I'm in control, I'm in her soul
Sugar daddy sometimes, no sugar coatin' one line when we talk
But she thought she could've found a new guy
That kid alright, but I'm her kryptonite, a different type
Larenz and Nia Long, Love Jones, dippin' on the bike
You growin' into a better woman, it's whatever, we thuggin'
New Prada every season, fifty ball on the budget
If it didn't occur (Huh?), she for me, I'm for her (Running)
Only thing worse than being alone is wishin' you were

[Chorus: Don Toliver, Nas & Big Sean]
It get kinda hard to replace me (Kinda hard to)
So don't go lookin' for nobody else (I'm one of one)
I was keeping my heart there on safety (Heart there on)
But now I'm letting it go until ain't none left (That part)
You got a lot to lose, but it's all basic
I'll probably ride the times to prevent a late text (I'll probably ride the times)
I bet I'm living it up while so spacey (Bet I'm living it up)
You love to wine and dine, come be my lady (Yeah), lady

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
You talk a little sweet about me, a lot of sour
I know that you believe in stars
And just like stars, you know your words got a lot of power
You know I'm good at reading you, I spent like ten thousand hours
I must've bought you ten thousand flowers, ignore red flags and audibles
I even bought your daughter clothes and your father clothes
And I bought you diamonds even though I got a heart of gold
And on your enemies, we rode, I go Picasso, Art of War
We a different pedigree
I did some foul shit across the line, you seen the petty me
I never gave you infidelity or tried to wreck your credibility
I'm not your ex, I'm your ecstasy
Methamphetamines, ain't no better me, facts

[Chorus: Don Toliver, Big Sean & Nas]
It get kinda hard to replace me (Kinda hard to, yeah)
So don't go lookin' for nobody else (Straight up)
I was keeping my heart there on safety (That's right, heart there on)
But now I'm letting it go until ain't none left (You know I'm the one)
You got a lot to lose, but it's all basic (Haha)
I'll probably ride the times to prevent a late text (I'll probably ride the times, I ride that)
I bet I'm living it up while so spacey (Bet I'm living it up, woah, woah)
You love to wine and dine, come be my lady, lady (Yeah)

[Outro: Big Sean & Nas]
You know I'm just tryna do what I'm meant to do
Teach and please you
You know, never mistreat you and treat you
You know how it goes
It's that Don Life shit
Sean Don
Esco
I got that New York walk
I got that Detroit soul, you know
Haha
