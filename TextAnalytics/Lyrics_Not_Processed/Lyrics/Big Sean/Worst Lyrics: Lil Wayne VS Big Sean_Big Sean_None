Ken & Rap Critc:
We thought it would be cool if we did like you just of, I guess like one of your ideas the whole worst lyrics thing and just kind of- so made it like Dead End Hip Hop infused type of thing conversation

Rap Critic:
What do you guys want to do now, like. This is a Big Sean VS Lil Wayne and I was like

Myke C-Town
Who lyrics are worst. Because we didn't want to do exactly what you do

Rap Critc & Myke C Town:
Yeah, but um- Some kind of argument here one person is an obvious loser in this scenario. oh, you think? yes I do. Hold your opinon to the camera. Alright, alright

Ken:
Alright everybody, welcome to another episode of Dead End Hip Hop. And we have a special guest joining us, it's the Rap Critic

Rap Critic:
Yo, it's the Rap Critic. Um, Google me at Rap Critic- I came up with my name before I knew there were other rap critics on the internet.
My Patreon is Patreon.com/RapCritic, yeah um.

Myke C-Town & Rap Critc
Dropping the money- I don't know I'm the Rap Critic, give me some motherfucking money. You pay me, bitch

Ken:
But yeah, so we got with him. We're going to do a collab. We basically just kind of combining the channels man. He has a series called 'Worst Rap Lyrics'

Rap Critic:
Worst Lyrics I've Ever Heard (This Month) which is like this is what I just happened to hear that sucked this month and then next month I'll have lyrics that I happened to hear that all- that sucks

Ken:
We are going to actually debate, somehow, um verse. Who has the who lyrics: Big Sean or- or you know- you already know man Lil Wayne

Myke C-Town:
Before we start, who's on side Big Sean, who's on side Lil Wayne?

Rap Critic:
I'm not on side, but- oh I'm side-

Myke C-Town:
Who do you think is worse? Just before we even start just throw-

Beezy:
Big Sean

Myke C-Town:
You think Big Sean is worst than Lil Wayne?

Ken:
I will probably go Sean Too.

Myke C-Town & Rap Critc:
Okay, and you think Wayne. Wayne. I'm a little- I'm still a little bit on the fence, but here's the thing. I think Wayne, terrible, but it's funny. Big Sean is so fucking bad he makes you mad- But here's the thing. But I'm with Big Sean

Rap Critc:
The thing I'll say is that, it's a little unfair because- if you're gonna compare discographies. Big Sean hasn't had that much time to give you as much shit

Ken:
But he had enough time for us to make a decision

Rap Critic & Ken:
But what I mean is that, saying who's worse, I would say Lil Wayne is worse because (Okay) he has so much that's bad, you know what I mean. I'll put it to you like this- Sheer volume

Myke C-Town:
But he has good albums. Big Sean-

Ken & Myke C-Town:
Right, Lil Wayne is a fell off- Exactly Big Sean never came up

Beezy:
Way to put it, way to put it, way to put it

Rap Critc:
I'll say this, he has kind of- I wont say master, but he's definitely made it an interesting flowing like the sort of hemiola rap. This guy is thinking about this, you know and so I can't completely just go like, "No you suck, because-" you know and that- that's what I tkae into account, like Soulja Boy, he's not thinking on that level

Beezy:
He never had too

Rap Critc:
Yeah, I know yeah. Vanilla Ice- well, relative to now, he's actually not as terrible

Myke C-Town:
He's better than Big Sean

Rap Critc:
Serious, honestly for real. I honestly think people were a little to harsh on Vanilla Ice

Myke C-Town,  Ken, Rap Critic & Beezy:
Yeah they were- It was because of- It was because of he was fronting (Exactly, exactly) That's what lead to his downfall. And know that's a thing that you do so everybody is like. It's weird, he opened to door for being- for being kind of a fake and now that's just kind of life- oh no (That's the standard) People don't tell the truth

Myke C-Town:
Give us a Lil Wayne lyric you think it- it could out do any wack Big Sean lyrics. And I'll see- I'll see if I can one up you
Rap Critic:
Lil Wayne - How to Hate (Ft. Young Fyre & T-Pain)From Tha Carter IV
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
Rap Critc:
Come on, did he just say that to me? Did I just hear that? That recorded, and other people are like 'Yeah, no, what's wrong with that?'

Myke C-Town:
You think that's- you think that's worse than
Big Sean - Play No Games (Ft. Chris Brown & Ty Dolla $ign)From Dark Sky Paradise[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm all ears, in other words here for ya
Rap Critc:
That line is too, it's not- it's not punchy enough to be like 'What?' It's more like- just like 'Oh, okay whatever'

Beezy:
Okay, how about this, okay
Big Sean - Cosmic Kev Freestyle October 10, 2014[Verse 2]
I'm trying to move in my safe
Like the safe was a safehouse
Beezy:
You reacting- isn't that bad

Rap Critic:
Alright, alright
Rap Critic:
Lil Wayne - Mrs. Officer (ft. Kidd Kidd & Bobby V) From Tha Carter III[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & (Bobby Valentino)]
Then I beat it like a cop
Rodney King, baby, yeah I beat it like a cop
Hahah! Beat it like a cop
Rodney King, baby, yeah I beat it like a cop
Rap Critic & Myke C-Town:
Four times in succession, look up Mrs. Officer. That's tight. No that's not. That's tight. No, no Beat it like a cop- He's dropping it to make you understand. Okay, that's ridiculous Okay, okay
(Editor Note: How can you drop bad bars with Drake and Kanye on your song?)

Myke C-Town:
Big Sean - Blessings (Ft. Kanye West & Drake)From Dark Sky Paradise[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
Beezy & Myke C-Town:
Come on, come on. I rather beat it like a cop. Beat it like a cop- So wack

Rap Critic:
It seems like you're reading me dad jokes

Beezy:
That's perfect

Myke C-Town:
Dad joke rap. You're absolutely right
Ken:
Big Sean - FireFrom Hall of Fame[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave
Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speak in Trapanese
Rap Critic:
Not that bad

Myke C-Town:
Trapanese
Rap Critic:
Paris Hilton - Good Times (Ft. Lil Wayne)[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I walked up to a big butt, and ask her ass "Butt What?"
Myke C-Town:
That's it?

Rap Critic:
Yes. I walked up to a big butt, and ask her ass Butt What. Not even a wordplay

Beezy:
Wayne said that?

Rap Critic:
Yes

Myke C-Town:
Butt what (*does some weird dance*)

Rap Critic:
I'm just putting all the shit jokes off, because we- there's too many. There's too many.
Lil Wayne - Swag SurfFrom No Ceilings[Verse]
I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search
Rap Critic:
What did you just requested me? That's a Lil Wayne lyric, that's your boy

Ken:
Grabbed a Wayne lyric here. I don't know if you got this, but
(Editor Note: This is a Big Sean lyric and not a Lil Wayne lyrics? What)
Logic - Alright (Ft. Big Sean)From Under Pressure (Deluxe Version)[Verse 2: Big Sean]
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician (Good)
Beezy:
Is that coming out of Human Being?

Myke C-Town:
I never heard that one
(*Probably because that wasn't LIL WAYNE*)
I love it

Rap Critic:
This is the one, no, this is like
Lil Wayne - Yes (Ft. Pharrell Williams)[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Weezy F baby and the 'F' is for phenomenal
Beezy & Myke C-Town:
Yeah I think we- yeah I- (Come on)

Ken:
Yeah he did that

Rap Critic:
And what's funny is that I went on Rap Genius and was like maybe there's something I'm missing. It said like if it was Spanish it would be spelled like f-f-fphe- and I was like really

Myke C-Town:
I got plenty of Lil Wayne lyrics
Lil Wayne - HustlinFrom Dedication 2[Verse 1]
And I got a bitch with me, call her "Miss Without-Drawers"
And I'm at the bank, you could call me "Mr. Withdrawals"
Myke C-Town:
That's dumb as fuck. But you see that's the thing. Lil Wayne is better than Big Sean. Lil Wayne can say that terrible ass line and you laugh. When Big Sean said some shit
Big Sean - Dark Sky (Skyscrapers)From Dark Sky Paradise[Verse 2]
Credit card used to be EBT, in the D though that's D-EBT
Ken:
You know what
Big Sean - I Do ItFrom Finally Famous[Verse 2]
She put that thong on my groin-groin and then it go boing!
Rap Critic & Myke C-Town:
It's interesting, I guess Lil Wayne just goes so over the top that it comes around for some people (and it works) and it becomes entertaining again. Big Sean doesn't go far enough is what I'm getting from you guys

Myke C-Town:
Big Sean is just corny, that's what makes it worse for me. Here's the- I don't think Big Sean delivers the lines with confidence. I feel like Big Sean deep down kind of knows that these lines are shit. Lil Wayne comes in and saids I just wrote the best shit, yeah I'm the shit ya'll just poop stains. He said that shit like that shit is dope.

Ken:
What you got?

Beezy:
Oh, um
Big Sean - Stay DownFrom Dark Sky Paradise[Verse 2]
Yeah, tryna get that hotel money
But you know them crackers ain't gonna let you get the Ritz
Rap Critic:
No I got it

Myke C-Town:
Big Sean so deep he didn't even get it. He didn't even get it- he didn't even get it
Myke C-Town:
Big Sean - I Know (Ft. Jhene Aiko)From Dark Sky Paradise[Bridge: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Myke C-Town:
We on a roll like we did good in colledge

Rap Critic:
Honor roll, come on

Myke C-Town:
I wish I did

Rap Critic:
Come on, it at least took you a second to figure out what was going on. Come on

Beezy:
I didn't hear what he said, and I was like repeat that again

Myke C-Town:
This is the problem with Big Sean, even the way he delivers it when you hear it you're like what the fuck are you doing rapping

Rap Critic & Myke C-Town:
You know- you know what I'm going to say actually I feel like- um, going back to delivery, I feel like that is actually partially important. His- his voice isn't strong enough (Yes) and- and that will go to what you said, so as far as you know the dexterity in what he's doing that's cool, but I feel like the forcefulness doesn't hit as hard and so when the punchlines aren't as strong it- it's that much more pungent
Beezy:
 Big Sean - Win Some, Lose Some (Ft. Jhene Aiko)From Dark Sky Paradise[Verse 2: Big Sean]
On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot
Wishin' me and you were no strings attached, but were nots
Myke C-Town:
See, it's painful. It's fucking painful.

Ken:
It's fucking painful

Beezy:
See, Big Sean is worse than Lil Wayne
Myke C-Town:
Big Sean - You Don't Know (Ft. Ellie Goulding)From Hall of Fame[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck about feelings, I ain't no dentist
Myke C-Town:
But you see it's funny now, but when you hear him say it, you're just like what the fuck. Lame ass. When Lil Wayne drops that shit you're like okay that was funny

Rap Critic:
I just feel like the over saturation of Lil Wayne and the fact that- this is the metaphor I'm thinking of, he's especially like in 2007 to 2010. There was this big period where he was just on everything. Even if the verses weren't good or not, it's just the fact that he's there, he's on the song, he has to be on every song and so- and the problem with that is like if every verse was fantastic, that would have been great, but most of them were subpar. It's like the amount is so much that's just wack, and yes there's a lot that's good, but I feel like the problem is that most of it is polluted it's actually- it ruins the sorta legacy of him and that's what I feel makes it work. At least Big Sean was never at a point to disappoint

Beezy:
But you know what though

Ken & Beezy:
But with the counter to that is- is also this- look we know Lil Wayne is not even trying to write his shit. He's drinking, he's on drugs, he doing all kind of shit so he's going to the studio freestyling (Yeah). What Big Sean doing?
Big Sean - Live This Life (Ft. The-Dream)From Finally Famous[Verse 1: Big Sean]
This shit classic, they ask "where your outfit from?"
Plead the Saks Fifth
Rap Critc & Myke C-Town:
Well- (What) Well

Ken:
They ask where the outfit from, plead the Saks Fifth. He wrote that shit
Beezy:
Big Sean - Platinum and WoodFrom Dark Sky Paradise (Deluxe)[Verse 2]
Cause there's niggas in the streets
Getting money under my nose that I must stash
Myke C-Town:
That's tight

Ken: I have two more
Big Sean - Dance (A$$)From Finally Famous[Verse 2]
I got that mad dick, you know it always nut up
And it got an attitude, no wonder why it's stuck up
Beezy:
That what good, I'm sorry

Myke C-Town:
I like that

Ken:
Gah, let me finish

Myke C-Town:
That shit was drop, that shit was drop, I'm sorry. I would ride on that, that shit was dope
(Editor Note: This is my favorite one)
Big Sean - All Figured OutFrom Hall Of Fame[Verse 2]
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
Front of the plane: I'm Rozay Parks
Rap Critic:
Are you sure that's not a Kanye West line?
(Off topic from the debate, but worth to mention)
Kanye West - Good MorningFrom Graduation[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Ken:
Case close baby, case close, case close

Myke C-Town:
Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
That's tight, oh that's tight

Ken:
That's Big Sean man, that's Big Sean

Rap Critic:
Oh That's Big Sean

Ken:
Yeah, that's Big Sean

Myke C-Town:
Like I said before- god damn I don't want to follow that, but look, like I said before. The reason Big Sean comes off so much worse is not just the fact that the lyrics are wack, it's what he's actually saying. It's not the fact they don't rhyme well or they're just bad wordplay. Bruh, listen to this. This is some shit no rapper should really be talking about

Ken:
Okay
Myke C-Town:
(Editor Note: I like the ad-libs put in the song)
Big Sean - MILF (Ft. Juicy J & Nicki Minaj)From Hall of Fame[Verse 2: Big Sean & MILF]
boy she freaky (freaky)
Shoulda known she was kinky
When I walked inside the room and I seen her slinky (what the fuck)
Even made me use my pinky
Myke C-Town:
What fucking rapper brags about pinky banging some chick. Big fucking Sean. The chick is like I'm not fucking you, but you can get your pinky stinky and that's it.

Rap Critic:
What- what- how does the slinky work in?

Myke C-Town:
Have you never seen a girl slinky?

Rap Critic:
Is it like a- I'm not gonna say it

Ken:
Why are you looking at me?

Beezy: I got Lil Wayne for you, oh my god.
Lil Wayne - Lay It Down (Ft. Cory Gunz & Nicki Minaj)from I Am Not a Human Being II[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Niggas call me Hi-C because I'm high as you can see
Beezy:
Wait, wait, wait
Lil Wayne - Lay It Down (Ft. Cory Guns & Nicki Minaj)From I Am Not a Human Being II[Verse 1: Lil Wanye]
Niggas say they paid they dues, well I'm checkin' your receipt
Might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat
Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch, who but me?
Myke C-Town:
Wayne is tight, bruh

Rap Critic:
Who but me
Ken:
Lil Wayne - New SlavesFrom Dedication 5[Verse 2]
I got a knife in my pocket if there's a fork in the road
I'm the man of steel, but I won't say what I stole
Myke C-Town:
What

Rap Critic:
What's even the wordplay

Myke C-Town:
I'm the man on steal. See Wayne so deep you don't get it.

Rap Critic:
What are you stealing? I'm not telling you. That's for me to know, but- but my problem is that he- he's like basically a Jackson Pollock painting. Like, you know, hey he splashes at a wall and maybe sometimes it might be cool

Beezy:
Because of my name, because of my name

Rap Critic:
If anyone else said it, it would be, 'fuck you, moving on' and that's my problem. And the fact he was at such a high status at one point.

Beezy:
And Big Sean never hit that

Rap Critic:
And, no, no, no, I mean commercially

Myke C-Town:
Big Sean will be Bob Ross and he will always be Bob Ross

Rap Critic:
And I mean commercially, commercially- commercially he was at such a high point and there is where- just my life comes into it and was just like, 'oh this just is supposed to be the best rapper alive, well I need to hear all your verses and they have to be awesome forever' because if they're not, then why are you saying- calling yourself the best rapper alive. You know what I mean.

Ken:
It was a marketing ploy.

Rap Critic:
Yeah I know it was a marketing ploy, but it's just like- that's what makes you- that's- yeah I know, it got people to listen, but at the same time is just like, but what does it mean

Ken.
No, no, no, no, it did more then, then

Rap Critic:
Well it got people to believe, yeah I understand, but it's like- but then all that tells me is that you're great at building a facade

Rod (Modest Media):
Myke, give me some Lil Wayne lyrics before- we can now, but you gotta give us

Myke C-Town:
I'm in the hood-
(Editor Note: Genius Pages are sometimes the most outdated things in the word)
 Brisco - In the Hood (Ft. Lil Wayne)From Street Medicine[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm butter on the bread like Parkay
And I am all about me like Doe Ray
Myke C-Town:
This is specifically for you, if you ever meet Lil Wayne, this is what he'll say to your ass
Lil Wayne - DontgetitFrom Tha Carter III[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
What are you askin'? If I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
Myke C-Town:
Asking me, lil shit

Rap Critic:
Okay I don't know what to say to me. Are you trying to prove to me that Lil Wayne is wack. That what I was doing. We're trying to help you dog.

Myke C-Town:
Well, okay, so I guess we didn't come to a conclusion.

Rod (Modest Media):
We know they both have worst lyrics

Beezy:
You can tell us in the comment section. Whatever the folks say in the comment cause we said some pretty
Ken:
Lil Wayne - MegamanFrom Tha Carter IV[Verse 1]
How you niggas want it? Have it your way, Burger King
Myke C-Town:
You can tell a Lil Wayne line between a Big Sean line. Cause a Wayne line at least funny and they're kind of punny. Big Sean lines, like he said, they're dad jokes

Rap Critic:
They're puns, but they don't- they don't go all the way to be so ridiculous that it- they're hilarious. It's just like on the level like

Myke C-Town:
Exactly, it's disappointing.

Beezy:
Big Sean is worse, I'm still sticking with it

Rap Critic:
Okay, let's see. I think at the end of the day, I think what we figured out is that they're horrible in their own ways. Um, but it all depends on what you particularly think is worse. Do you think it's the awkwardness that's worse or just the amount of like- you know, lines that are bad. You know what I mean.

Ken:
The other thing Is that I don't think people have come to grips with Big Sean. This is Dead End Hip Hop, this is the Rap Critic. Subscribe to his channel on Youtube and let us know what you think have the worst lyrics, Big Sean or Lil Wayne. Let us know in the comment section. Piece, yall

Rap Critic:
This is the Rap Critic. You don't have to like my opinion, but I don't have to like your song.
It's something to note that there were a lot of Dark Sky Paradise lines than other Big Sean projects on this discussion
