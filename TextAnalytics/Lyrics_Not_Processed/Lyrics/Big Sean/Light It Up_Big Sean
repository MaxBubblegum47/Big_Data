[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh-huh
I got everything to lose
Whoa, whoa
We did it, Finally Famous, nigga

[Hook: Big Sean]
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up (lights)
It's time to light they ass up, light they ass up
They gon' know that it's us, they gon' know that it's us
They gon' know that it's us, light that shit up

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Story of my life, the come up (grind)
My night doesn't end 'til the sun up (grind)
Finger fucking the money
I do whatever to keep it coming (oh)
When I walk in the building they all give me stares
But I dare anybody to run up
And I ain't satisfied until I'm chubby, lil' bitch
And I got hundreds on my paper 'cause I studied, lil' bitch
Come and be my understudy, lil' bitch, I'm your boss, not your buddy
Matter of fact, don't talk or interrupt me
Matter of fact, if you standing next to us then you lucky
Matter of fact, wash your hands before you touch me, you disgusting lil' bitch
Always reppin', but I'm hardly home
Sean Don Perignon, Don Corleone
Hit the vroom vroom every single time the 'Rari on
Riding around in Malibu tryin' to  see a Barbie home
Came up from that one bedroom-room, now we on
Hoes bustin' dance moves harder than Omarion
Fur is so fresh, oh my God, it's still shedding
Radio flow, ho, I'm trying to break records
Getting every single thing on my checklist
I should be at the top of your threat list
When I come through have the bottles and confetti
Bitch, we ready

[Hook: Big Sean]
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up (lights)
It's time to light they ass up, light they ass up
They gon' know that it's us, they gon' know that it's us
They gon' know that it's us, light that shit up

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Before I hit more than finessing
Might walk on the beach in Giuseppe's
I think that my life is a blessin'
The girl that I'm with ego bigger than Precious
Before adolescence my development was arrested
Toss and turn in the bed restless
I'm glad that we made it back
Workin' the back on Mercedes hatch
Straps with the gatorback
Faded black, take the pussy, kleptomaniac
Take the pussy, never gave it back
Slap 'em with four types rings like an 80s cat
Looking for a great Dane, nightmares, Dana Dane
Changin' lanes, smoking back to back, chain and chain
Fuck it till I get fatigue, major pain, woo
Swag like the NBA, I dunk during a layup line (yeah)
Fuck a do not disturb, I need a bitch in here laced way up sign
Pay up time, I'm piped up in these streets
And if I put my jewelry on the light bill increase

[Hook: Big Sean]
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up (lights)
It's time to light they ass up, light they ass up
They gon' know that it's us, they gon' know that it's us
They gon' know that it's us, light that shit up
