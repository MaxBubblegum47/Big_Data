[Intro: Scarface]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Yeah, Aye, Aye-o At Night I Can't Sleep,I Toss And Turn
I Get Lost For Words,Its Like I Lost My Nerves
It All Started With My Chick About A Bitch That I Hit
That I Swear Ain't Shit,But She Swear I Ain't Shit
Awww Man Lord Help Her She Can't See What Im Sayin
'Or Hear What I Tell Her
It Feel Like Im Talking To Helen, Keller
I Wish That She Could Understand Me,Like A Shelter
I Called Her Up And Said Im Tired Of Beefin'
Told Her Im Leavin' And That Shes Not Needed
She Said Oh So You Just Done With Us, I Love You Doe
Yeah Well That Makes One Of Us And Hung Up
I Got Tired Of My Living Room Decor
Then Headed To The Liqour Store To Get Liqour
Swishor And A Stickor,And Then Pull A Lift Off
Til I Buzz Like Clipors And Pose Like A Clip Board
I Then Go Somewhere I Had No Business
Er'body Hands Up So It Wasn't The Question
I Started To Dippin' , It Take A Man With A Wooden Cane In The Air
To Reconize A Stick Up
Hell Yeah The Niggas Tried To Hit Me
But Off A Whole Round Swear To God They Just Missed Me
Then The Police Sirens were Roarin
They Took What They Saw Then Went Out The Back Door
Shit I Hoped Off The Floor Tryna See Which Way They Went
Mad Than A Motherfuckin' Bitch
Walked Back In To Make Sure Er'thang Was Cool
Looked On The Floor Saw Blood By The Pool
So I Asked The Clerk Dude Whats The Trouble
No Response but His Face Seemed Puzzled
I Walked Towards The Huddle To The Front Of The Crowd
And Thats When I Saw Myself Strecthed Out
See It Wasn't Til I Say My Own Body
That I Realized Them Pussy Ni***s Shot Me
Man I Couldn't Even Tell My Bitch I Love Her
Man I Couldn't Even Kiss My Mother
Ain't That Some Shit Homie?
My Mind Is Playin' Tricks On Me
