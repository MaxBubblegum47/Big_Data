[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah, G.O.O.D. Music
Starshell in the house
Let me see what the fuck you're about
Hey ladies!
Sup, I'm tryin' to take that down
Hey ladies!
Sup, I'm tryin' to take that down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Want money like Jay, clothes like Ye
Chicks like Seal, mass appeal
I'm just tryin' to feel if the ass is real
Man I should've known since she from Brazil
South side, my nigga, give me room now
Money high, yeah my pockets on shrooms now
I had a lot of bullshit I had to tune out
It's me and dude now, what you gon' do now?
Cause if you mess with the scrubs, then you gon' do the dishes
I ain't Flavor Flav, but you look delicious
And your heels vicious, killin' these bitches
I'm so sin-seriously pimpin!

[Verse 2: Starshell]
Highlights and designer blues
With my tattoos of, "I love you"
I just threw on these dancing shoes
To prove my love for you
I'm livin' it up
Secretly he notices how I'm playin' it up
For him, playin' it up
I'm livin' it up
Dancing on the tables as the DJ spinnin' it up
For me, spinnin' it up
For me, for me, for me, for me

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I do it, do it
Do it, do it, boy, boy, boy
B-I-G, okay show him you're a big girl
I'll show you why they call me big girl
I know you're tryin' to be my baby
But that mean I gotta lay you in the crib girl
Wobbledy-wobbledy wo-wobble wobble
I'm stack-stackin' my paper, my wallet look like a Bible
I got girlies half naked, that shit just look like the Grotto
How your waist anorexic and then your ass is colossal?
Like how you do that shit is not for real
Do it like you probably will
Okay, what you got is magic baby
So you gotta let me cop a feel, okay
Gon' touch your toesies, woahdie
Don't stop, keep going going going like my rollie
I might fuck around and put a tip on it
Fuck that, I'mma put my dick on it like woah

[Hook: Starshell]
Back to the beat, get up on your feet
Wanna be your superluva
Right back to the beat, get up on your feet
I'mma be your superluva
Wanna be your superluva

[Outro: Starshell]
Got 'em all sayin', "Hey hey hey"
Look at them, "Hey hey hey"
Look at them, "Hey hey hey"
Look at them, "Hey hey hey"
Got 'em all sayin'
