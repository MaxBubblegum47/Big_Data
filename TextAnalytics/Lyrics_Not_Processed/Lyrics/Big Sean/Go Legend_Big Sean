[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I go legend, I mean, Michael Jackson, hol' up
Prince in action, okay, I'm an original, you just a reenactment
Okay, peace sign and flashes
I live that picture perfect life you lie 'bout in your captions (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
When I was down, I swear they made me feel inferior (Straight up)
Judgin' me by my outside, that's just my exterior (Straight up)
Not seein' what I was made of, that's my interior (Real shit)
Didn't let that shit break me, instead, I broke the barriers
So fuck all y'all, praise Allah
It's my perog' like Bobby, bruh, massages by Nautia
In my castle like Mario, I give this shit my heart and soul
You boys got no cardio, all of my soldiers rock army clothes
'Head of my time like Marty though
Watchin' the Rick and Morty show, while I smoke
All these bands, still fuck her on the floor
Came from the dirt, all I had to do was grow
Remember when my shit got repossessed (Damn)
Mmm, that shit had us workin' like we possessed (Goddamn)

[Chorus: Travis Scott, Big Sean & Both]
Me and my best friend (Boy), 7-Eleven (Yeah, boy)
We go legend, we go legend (Yeah, yeah)
We go legend, we go legend (Alright)
We go legend, we go legend, yeah
With my best friend (Woah), 7-Eleven, yeah (Woah, yeah)
We go legend (Go), we go legend (Yeah, yeah, go), yeah (Yeah)
We go legend (Go), we go legend (Go legend, it's lit)
We go legend (Straight), we go legend, yeah (Straight up, yeah)
With my best friend (Alright, woah), 7-Eleven (Woah)
We go legend (Yeah), we go legend
Codeine legend (Yeah, yeah), microphone legend
We go legend, yeah
