Pull up and wreck (Yeah), pull up and
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Pull up with the spark, hit you in the dark (Woah)
Tear your ass apart when you swim with sharks
I'm in the car like Tony Starks 'cause I'm that smart (Skrrt)
Doin' 106, then park like I'm in my yard (Sideways)
And motherfuck the camera time, I need family time (Yeah)
I need "go see Uncle John in Atlanta" time (John)
I'd probably never get it, but it's cool to fantasize (It's cool)
Just like I do by old girl and these hands of mine (Whoa)
Grippin' on the titties, ass, and her thighs (Oh yeah)
Honestly, I'm over her and her lies
Cartier over my eyes while I analyze
Okay, me and lil' Metro, rockin' new retros
Take off your dress, ho, that's the new dress code (Yeah)
Too blessed to stress, that's my manifesto (Bless)
Fuck the professor, I'm too professional

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I ain't takin' disrespect, lil' nigga (Straight up)
Put a couple holes in your neck, lil' nigga (God)
Fuck a diss song, get you stressed, lil' nigga (21)
Got a shoestring 'round my TEC, lil' nigga (Facts)
Got a Mulsanne and a 'Vette, lil' nigga (21)
Brand new Carbine one-five and it's red, dog (21)
I ain't tryna fuck you, I just want some head, dog (Yeah)
Straight up out the Six and we don't shoot at legs, dog (Leg)
Zone 6 niggas love to see the white meat (21)
I put codeine all in my ice tea (Red)
Take a nigga bitch and then I make her wifey (Yeah)
Take a nigga bitch and then we do the nasty (Yeah)
All these diamonds drippin', now she wanna bite me (Facts)
She broke up with that nigga, now he wanna fight me (Ha)
Fox 5 Gang, we don't do no fightin' (Gang)
This Glock gon' knock a nigga down like Tyson (21, 21)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect (Disrespect)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
How a nigga changed and still stayed a hundred? (Huh)
I ran towards change while y'all ran from it (Whoa)
Y'all wanna ball, I'm Stan Van Gundy
She wanna hang with me and 'Ye, she know that's good company
I like my skies Carolina blue and white
True one, false move and that could paralyze your life (Brr)
So understand, I'm the overanalyzin' type (Type)
Panoramic views while I'm pannin' out my life (Look up, look up)
And I grew up playin' GoldenEye (Damn)
So I'm used to stickin' to the mission while they takin' shots
When you this high, you disconnect a lot (Yeah)
Sometimes I separate myself to connect the dots (I do)
Only way I'm goin' back is goin' back home (Home)
I don't drink tap water, but got tapped phones (Brr)
Dior on my suit, I'm the troop
Money come around, I'm never out the loop (Loop)
Kiss the bottom of my boot (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect

[Outro: Big Sean &

I’m talkin' FN’s and TEC’s, Rollies, Pateks
I heard that, you snitch, you got police on text
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect
