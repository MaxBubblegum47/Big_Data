[Intro]
Woah, woah, woah
Look, gotta have faith to be faithful (Uh-huh)
Gotta be great (Uh-huh)
Yeah

[Chorus]
Show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)
Show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)
You gotta show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)
My squad run the atlas, yeah (Yeah, woah)

[Verse 1]
Look, I can't take it easy, I don't know how (Know how)
Once I lock it in, it's good as done now (It's done now)
All that patience shit done run out (God)
I'm sorry you can't have your way with me (Way with me)
The ups and the downs that created me
I got the, I got the faith in me
Gotta have faith to be faithful (Yeah)
Gotta be great to be grateful (Yeah)
I seen that look in your eyes
That one Cain had gave Abel (Jealousy)
She gon' hip roll, this that 48221, Six Mile block shit (Woah)
So turnt up with my team in the huddle, it's a mosh pit (Wow)
I don't owe you nothin' if you ain't grow up in my house (House)
Niggas be prayin' on my downfall 'cause they goin' through a drought
Done proved myself so much, it's been a while, though, I admit it
So I'ma go so fuckin' hard, these hoes won't forget it

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's time to show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)

[Post-Chorus]
Look what you made me
Look what you made me (Ayy, ayy)
Look what you made me (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
And I'm feelin' godly, bullets can't stop me
I feel like Gotti, soldiers beside me
Goin' hard body, I can't go lightly
I feel like Pac right there in the lobby
She own big body, I'm riding big body (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She got a big body, she riding me properly
I hit it twice and she ready to die for me (Woah)
I switched it up just to break the monotony
My whole life you told me I had trust issues (Trust issues)
Looked at her, said, "Nah, bitch, I got us issues" (Go)
Meet and greet, meet my demands
Can't bill us, we buildin' a brand (Woah)
I'm going all money in with my bros like I'm Nip and Blacc Sam
Back the fuck back, you in my entrance (In my entrance)
They tried to count me out, came to they senses (Oh my God)
In the trenches, it's a different type of tension (Yeah, I been there)
Made a way out of no way, I did shit different (Go)
Man, fuck that tea shit, this that "Supa Dupa Lemonade" (Uh-huh)
Took it back to where we started just to see how far we came
I heard you keep what you love that's valuable inside your safe
I keep mine inside my heart, I guess we value different things (God)
I make all my haters proud of me when I'm in this mentality
Had people that loved me doubted me, but that bring the best out of me
They studying my every move, go get your ass a damn degree
You listen to me, I listen to you, like that ain't it, chief

[Chorus]
I'ma show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)
Show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)
You gotta show these bitches who the baddest (Go, go, go)
My squad run the atlas (Yeah)
God (God)

[Post-Chorus]
Look what you made me (Ayy)
Look what you made me (Ayy)
Look what you made me (Ayy, ayy)
