[Intro: French Montana]
Yes, Nip
Montana
Wiz
Uh

[Chorus: French Montana]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it, haah
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fuckin' with me
And the money call, nigga I'm on it
Nigga, I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave, haah
And, nigga, I'm on it
Nigga, I'm on it

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Got the proposition with no pot to piss in
We the hardest out, it ain't no competition
And I be's the jungle fever
Get the hard chiba, lower than a dark caesar
Unbeatable, unbelievable and the drug dealers love me
Told me I ain't need the blow
Here's a half a brick, nigga, you don't need to show
But I took it easy like I don't see the toll
Jewelry 3 below, niggas get pita rolled
Tunnel vision on that money, I don't see a hoe
I'm 'bout the chops, that shottie spark, blew off a body part
Hoe

[Chorus: French Montana]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it, haah
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fuckin' with me
And the money call, nigga I'm on it
Nigga, I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave, haah
And, nigga, I'm on it
Nigga, I'm on it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, uh
First nigga to put it down, rep the city the way I do it
Got these niggas rollin' they drugs, bitches with they hand out
But we don't feed nothin' but champagne and zigzag stuffers
Takin' pictures with my campaign stuntin'
Nigga, I ain't showin off, them niggas tuck they wings
I'm the flyest in my course
High as fuck at the game, sittin' courtside with my bad bitch and she roll up too
Just a couple names you should fear
Nowhere near tired but had a good year
If bitches still choosin' niggas hatin' on me
If you ain't talkin' paper, that's another story

[Chorus: French Montana]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it, haah
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fuckin' with me
And the money call, nigga I'm on it
Nigga, I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave, haah
And, nigga, I'm on it
Nigga, I'm on it

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Yuh, Hussle, listen
Look
See I'm the type of nigga they know not to push
Plus I got them type of choppers leave Osama shook
Real crook, you would think I'm was some type of Bush
Those bitches open their legs so I octopus
It's all money in, but that's just common sense
I wish that y'all could see these checks I be depositin'
We drives in, bitches rides in
Bitch times ten like fuck who I offend
We just do us, you just copy them
Two X's, one L, we the top ten
And I ain't never been too big about what the critics say
Unless the critics say that type of shit that get me baked
Hussle

[Chorus: French Montana]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it, haah
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fuckin' with me
And the money call, nigga I'm on it
Nigga, I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave, haah
And, nigga, I'm on it
Nigga, I'm on it

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
I just, I just, I just want the money and the power (I Do)
And I get 'em both ten thousand miles an hour (I Do)
That's why your girl would leave with me but you will not allow her
Fuck your lil' section, bitch, I want the entire
My nigga Wiz roll up like we cripple, respect
Man, I bet syou call big when I'm little (Haha)
And she gone' call me big when she wiggle
Me and two hoes and I'm just chillin' in the middle (Like waddup though?)
Bitch, your whole life is fictional
Your bitch want to play doctor on my dick, she want my physical
Smokin' medical marijuana, my shit's medicinal
I love it, love it, love it
Bitch, I love it unconditional (Boy)

[Chorus: French Montana]
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it, haah
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fuckin' with me
And the money call, nigga I'm on it
Nigga, I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave, haah
And, nigga, I'm on it
Nigga, I'm on it
Haah
