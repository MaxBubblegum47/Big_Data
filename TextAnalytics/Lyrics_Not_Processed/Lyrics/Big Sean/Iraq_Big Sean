Iraq in this bitch, Iraq [I turn the club to]
Iraq in this bitch/Iraq in this bitch
[One call] Iraq in this bitch
Iraq in this bitch Iraq in this bitch
[You better get down] Iraq in this bitch
Iraq in this bitch, Iraq [You better get down]
Iraq in this bitch//Iraq in this bitch
Iraq in this bitch

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Now why why why/Would you compare me to you
If you think we're equal/Then bitch, you are remedial
Remember who you're speaking to/Call it egotistical
But I am one of one, Yup and there is not a sequel, sequel
Soon as I approach in/Please do not approach him
Or you will need a little more than Ibuprofen (B.I.G.)
Please try and test us/One hand gesture
We'll fill they ass with lead like standardized testing, testing
And you already know where I live
How could I make it out that bitch being a bitch
(I know) I'mma drink glass after glass
(I know) I tend to act for ass over ass
Bet a stack I'll make your bitch come over
There's diamonds on deck like a nigga playing poker
I hear them niggas talkin' but bet all they do is look
See, to you I'm Mr. Big but to him, I'm Mr. Bush, Bitch. Look, bitch

[Verse 2: Dustly McFly]
Success brings envy
I gotta watch out for these jealous thugs
So I am working with these mags like editors
I went from trapping to rapping to make a extra buck
But now I keep that shotty by me like a Elmer Fudd
McFly shitting, I know the haters smell us
I make it hard to breathe they need oxygen inhalers
I'm so froze I need a double sweater//I got two softball hoes
And every time I run home, they give me double headers
You can't come to my city talking absurd
And don't take it from me, just ask Young Berg
So if I snatch your bitch, you better get to walking
You think you cute? You probably look better in a coffin
Flight leer ice gear, Phantom, I just must steer
Little nigga just build a buzz/You just had a light year
And I am sick of all of this hating shit
Had 'em dumping like a bad ass relationship
