[Intro: Kanye West]
Yo, waddup this is Kanye and you're checking out Big Sean, 
Finally Famous: Volume 1
It's crazy though how I met him, you know
I'm leaving the radio station and he comes up to me like "Yo, I just wanna spit for you"
And I say "Okay, you got 16" and he went and spit about 100 bars and I looked at him
And I said "That shit was crazy, I'mma sign you"
I know I'd just seen pretty like unbelievable, the stories we always hear about
But when I heard the songs he was doing, man I knew he had to be on GOOD Music
So man, congratulations dawg, you're finally famous
