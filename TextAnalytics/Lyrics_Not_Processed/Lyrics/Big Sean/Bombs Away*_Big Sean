[Intro: Chance the Rapper]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Jeremih]
One time for the one I want (Woo)
[?], you're the one I need
Bombs away, bombs away
Two times for the one I need
London chick, you're the one I need
Say bombs away, bombs away

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
And I like that, and you need that
You fight back, no need
I'm your king, girl
Have it your way
Your way, your way, your way
When you treat me like flashbacks
Leave me, right back
You need me
Girl, I'm here to stay
To stay, to stay, to stay
Girl, my timing, timing's wrong
And I don't mind
Any day, Sunday through Monday
And I don't mind
Don't you ever tell me you don't need nobody
All in your way
You know where I'll be, right there

[Chorus: Jeremih]
One time for the one I want (Woo)
[?], you're the one I need
Bombs away, bombs away
Two times for the one I need
London chick, you're the one I need
Say bombs away, bombs away

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Hey, you there, you there
What you gon' do?
Sittin' on the edge with your feet up in the pool
You might as well put your boonie in the pool
It's a party when your booty in the pool
I mean, come clean, you could do what you do
Put it on ice, keep the wine cooler cool
When you drop bombs with your cannonball
Let's make a splash, babe
Tell 'em it's going down
After a bath, babe
I'ma go grab a towel
Wanna see you hoppin' out
Heads is turnin' like a owl
We could take it in the house
We should take it in the house
First off, let me know your name
Hold the phone, baby, hold the plane
Askin' if there's liquor there
Can your friend come too? No, she can't
Oh, your name
Lookin' like Lois Lane
Her name Anna Mae and she rode a plane
Rode a plane, rode a plane
One time for the bombshells
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Two times for the boys out there
Huh, huh
No time for the silly games
Pretend to play
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
I ain't really tryna knock you down
I ain't really tryna knock you down
No, no, no
I just really wanna lock you down
I just really wanna lock you down
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I be trippin' when you not around
Can't stand when you not around
No, no, no
I just wanna hear them opera sounds
We can hit another octave now
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout

[Chorus: Jeremih & Big Sean]
One time for the one I want (Woo)
[?], you're the one I need
Bombs away, bombs away
Two times for the one I need (Two, two)
London chick, you're the one I need (I'm like)
Say bombs away, bombs away (Woah, woah, okay)

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Chance the Rapper]
Call me when you outside, I'ma run down (Run)
Let's get high, not come down
I love how me and you never run outta things to talk about
You the bombshell like bombs away (Bomb)
We hit Mexico, I mean andelé (Woah)
I'm wakin' up to breakfast in lingerie
So I'm not sure what's the time of day
Ooh, you keep it honest with me, tell me, what's your forté?
Do you like threesomes? Are you into foreplay? (Oh)
Prince and MJ, your favorite karaoke
She can make doves cry, Annie, are you okay? (Okay)
I just wanna hear you scream (Scream)
We be laughin' at the memes
Her mama sixty and still fine
So her genes tight since I hit it
So her genes tight, her ass fat
I might screenshot but she trust me, you know (Trust)
We got a love that's custom, you know
They gon' try and get to us like customs, you know
Us is U-S, you just lay down low
I put the piece down like A-Town, oh
'Cause it's all love when we lay down slow
Nah, baby, I got it, got it
Take your feet from the dirt to the sand, you know
First time out in France you know (First time)
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Postcards and Goyard
When I go in, I go hard (Go hard)
Tryna hit the spot like I'm throwin' darts
She don't like rap, I'm so appalled (Appalled)
But I still make her hit my ad-lib, she like, "Oh God"
She like, "Oh God", she like, "Oh"

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
I ain't really tryna knock you down
I ain't really tryna knock you down
No, no, no
I just really wanna lock you down
I just really wanna lock you down
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I be trippin' when you not around
Can't stand when you not around
No, no, no
I just wanna hear them opera sounds
We can hit another octave now
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout

[Chorus: Jeremih]
One time for the one I want (Woo)
[?], you're the one I need
Bombs away, bombs away
Two times for the one I need
London chick, you're the one I need
Say bombs away, bombs away
