Ay, you know we had to do the remix right?

Trigga nigga, yeah
Oh my, oh my, oh, oh my God
My nigga, you see that ass up on that broad?
Dumb, dumb-dumb-dumb, dumb, dumb
That booty’s so retarded
And when it comes to this R&B shit I'm the hardest, regardless
Listen to the track, bitch!

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You the one girl
Somethin' 'bout them jeans that you wearin'
Somethin' 'bout them jeans that you wearin'
Girl, you got the body of a goddess (Body of a goddess)
And it ain't no competition, you got it, I want it, I'm on it
You make me wanna say, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Oh my, that booty bumpin', oh my, that booty bumpin' (Yeah)
Jeans fittin' right, hair did, shawty you the best

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
You know me, I do my thing with the women
Make her body purr when I'm touching on her kitten
Booty's so round, waist so skinny
Hit it on the balcony with your face to the city
Face so pretty
Heels so high that I face your titties
Mouth so dry, I could taste your titties
Girl, I'ma hit it right, have faith, no biggie
Oh my, I'm so high
Come and be one of Tremaine's angels, fly
Sky is the limit, I've been fly for a minute
And that girl singin' fast, so rewind it a minute
I want you on my team, we be like Charlie Sheen
Winnin' this life of sinnin' when women be likin' women
And men is like ripened lemons, sour when I pass by
Wait 'til I'm in the denim, I'ma hit that ass like

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You the one girl
Somethin' 'bout them jeans that you wearin'
Somethin' 'bout them jeans that you wearin'

You make me wanna say, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Jeans fittin' right, hair did, shawty you the best
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

Oh my, that booty bumpin', oh my, that booty bumpin' (Yeah)
Jeans fittin' right, hair did, shawty you the best

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Shawty you the one, ain't too many choices
Louis on my feet, cost me 10 pair of Air Forces
When you mention me, know my girls are really gorgeous
I be all up in the cut like some Neosporin
Tity, 2 Chainz, I got my name on my upholstery
Married to the streets, ain't no way you can divorce 'em
Got the ceiling cracked, so I'm shinin' like a oyster
Got them racks on top of racks like I was hangin' in the closet
Hold up, hold up, pause it, flow that'll make you nauseous
Got a girl with a back so big and an ass so big
Look like she crawlin'
Fallin', sprawlin', yeah we Chris Paulin'
I just call her boo, but I met her at the mall and
Me and DJ Drama, add another comma
I put it in her ribs and say I'm workin' on her stomach
This girl I'm with, she mine, the girl you with, she mine
I put her ass on top, then I press recline

Pussy nigga, you're a pussy, so who the hell is you kiddin'? Get it?
Hear you takin' shots, now, what the fuck is you sippin'?
Nigga, I'm at the tippy, I run my city
That one in the club ad they bring me my liquy
I pull down her zippy, I'm all in her Vickies
She calling me "Biggie", I'm callin' her "silly"
Never slip 'cause I'm rollin' up sticky, she gave me her icky
Girl you the baddest, I promise I'm picky
And even if we fuck, I promise that you ain't fuckin' with me
Uh, bad bitches know wassup
She tell me that she love me, I tell her "Join the club"
D-Town reppin' 'til I die, hoe
Chillin' on the top floor, go
