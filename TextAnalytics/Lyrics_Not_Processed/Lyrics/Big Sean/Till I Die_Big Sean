[Intro: Chris Brown]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
This Virginia
Straight from the country, right there with my kinfolk
Golds in my mouth and they put 26's on Benzos
Dirt roads, back woods, they got weed but I've been dope
Ratchet, nigga, we act hood
But I'm gettin' money with these white folk
Sippin' and I'm faded, s-s-s-super medicated
Said she wanna check the pole, I said, "Okay, Sarah Palin"
Yeah, yeah-yeah-y-y-y-yeah, so I lay down and lay in
A nigga gon' be faded, all the way to the AM, yeah

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Boi, damn, whoa, shit

[Chorus: Big Sean & Chris Brown]
Okay, more drink, po' it up (Boi)
More weed, roll it up (Boi)
Whoa there, ho, you know wassup (You know wassup, I'm high)
Quit hoggin' the blunt, bitch, slow down
Pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down
Damn, bitch, I do it (I'm high, do it, do it)
And this the life we chose
Workin' all night, swear I'm never goin' broke (I'm high)
Broke, and I'ma do this 'til I die (Die)
And I ain't talkin' shit just 'cause I'm, just 'cause I'm (What? I'm high)

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Yup
Whoa, boi
Oh God, oh God (Boi, boi)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, wow, bow, look at me now
Chief like a Indian, talkin' in clouds
I'm high as a bitch, I'm talkin' to clouds
Off tree every night like I roam with the owls
I super soak that ho
Show 'em no love, just throw 'em a towel
Still rockin' Louis Vuitton condoms (Still)
'Cause I'm so fuckin' in style, wow
New crib, crash that (Whoa)
Drove here, cab back (Swerve)
Now knock that pussy out (Out)
Yeah, that's just a little cat nap
Hold up, hold up, whoa, don't be smokin' my shit (My shit)
I be smokin' that fire (That fire)
She be smokin' my dick (My dick)

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Be smokin' my dick, boi
Lil' bitch
Whoa, okay

[Chorus: Big Sean, Chris Brown & Both]
Okay, more drink, po' it up (Boi)
More weed, roll it up (Boi)
Whoa there, ho, you know wassup (You know wassup, I'm high)
Quit hoggin' the blunt, bitch, slow down
Pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down
Damn, bitch, I do it (I'm high, do it, do it)
And this the life we chose
Workin' all night, swear I'm never goin' broke (I'm high)
Broke, and I'ma do this 'til I die (Die)
And I ain't talkin' shit just 'cause I'm, just 'cause I'm (What? I'm high)
Yeah

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa]
Tahahahaha, uh

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Smokin', chokin', always rollin' something
I don't need a key to start my car
Bitch, I just push a button
Did a show and got a half a mil'
And spent it like it's nothing, money flowin'
Never sober, smokin' 'til I got concussions, no discussion
Man, I got a condo and got a big crib
Pounds all over my kitchenettes
If I ain't on the road gettin' it
Then I'm in the hood where my niggas live
Did a tour, sold it out
Just bought a pound, 'bout to finish it
Now all my pasta got shrimp in it
You talk about it, and I'm livin' it (And I'm livin' it)

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa & Big Sean]
Fuckin' little bitch, hahahahaha
Boi, whoa
Uh!

[Chorus: Big Sean, Chris Brown & Both]
Okay, more drink, po' it up (Boi)
More weed, roll it up (Boi, ah!)
Whoa there, ho, you know wassup (You know wassup, what? I'm high)
Quit hoggin' the blunt, bitch, slow down (Haha!)
Pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down
Damn, bitch, I do it (Ha, I'm high, do it, do it)
And this the life we chose
Workin' all night, swear I'm never goin' broke (Ha, I'm high, haha)
Broke, and I'ma do this 'til I die (Die, what?)
And I ain't talkin' shit just 'cause I'm, just 'cause I'm (What? I'm high)

[Outro: Chris Brown & Big Sean]
Real nigga never frontin' (Yeah)
'Cause when you got it all, errybody want somethin'
Middle finger in the air, no fist pump
And me, Sean and Wiz got this bitch jumpin'
Huh, finally got this bitch jumpin'
Got this bitch jumpin'
Fly, that's me
Hahahaha
