I'm m√©nage-in' at the garden
Pussy juice on my beard, James Harden
I'm the meanest don that I walk in (That I walk in)
(I'm the realest coming out of Harlem)
Might pull up with Louis Farrakhan
In a Bentley coupe blacker than Akon (Yeah)
Might hit the club with The Nation
If I make it rain it take a day long (Yeah)
Might fuck your bitch on vacation (Yeah)
New Gosha all my clothes A1 (Yeah)
I'm the reincarnated Trayvon
With a BAPE hoodie that zip up to my face, gone (Right)

RIP to Ye mama (Right)
Why they crucify Cosby? (Yeah)
Why they scrutinize my peeps? (Yeah)
Blew the noises off my sphinx

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I tell a bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan (Uh)
Then I take you out the dirt and turn it into sand
Just trust in what I'm saying (And quit)
Quit asking what's gotten into me
You don't need a nigga with them tender tendencies
I think you need a lil' more Hennessy
Fuck your man, I'll be your sensei
I could teach you how to keep the rent paid
Got the schedule boomin', I mean poppin'
Poppin' to the point the phone die in mid-day (Brrt)
But I call you late night just to fall through
Bust a nut and then regret it like a nigga always do
But don't I always hit you with the hit back
And if I ever fucked another bitch I pretended it was you
I admit that, not saying that I did that
Chill, chill, chill, take it easy, Yeezy, don't be going all Kill Bill
Show respect to the whole squad and Yeezy Yeezy
I'ma give you everything you fucking needed

[Outro: Big Sean]
Believe it
Straight up
Whoa, whoa, whoa
