[Intro: NLE Choppa & 
Big Sean
]
(
Pipe that shit up, TnT
)
(
Tahj Money
)
Brr, we on (
For real, for real
)
Nigga, you know what we on
Woah, woah
 (Brr)
Straight up
Yeah, yeah, the Top Shotta, I got the bombs like Al-Qaeda
Ayy

[Chorus: NLE Choppa]
Thug nigga, we trappin' in the moonlight
We get the bag gone the same day, the same night
Don't talk on tapped phones, you know the feds run devices
My mom my backbone, she stood by me wrong or right
Let me rewind this shit, gotta rewind that lick
I lost 'bout ten on that shit, I gotta go and get it back
Got 'bout forty on my wrist, I got 'bout two hoes on my dick
I know she seen me when I glisten, now shе wanna take a pic

[Verse 1: NLE Choppa]
It seems like gun light's the sunlight (Brr, brr)
Onе pipe, one life, and a few stripes (A few stripes)
I changed my ways, my future brighter, it was scary, Michael Myers (It was scary, Michael Myers)
Feel entitled 'cause I want the title, take it from my rival (Take it from my rival)
Who feelin' my sorrow? Pain in a bottle with desire, ho
Look up to Ralo, I wanna own the hood I put on
Put on like cologne, I wanna show you you don't need a loan
Throw my hood on, it's VLONE, Amiri denims, though
And we done see a lot
A lotta killings on that block
And it left us in shock
Fuck medication, I've been meditatin', facin' my problems
Police investigating, got another charge, ain't do nothin', hmm
I ain't never gon' lay down
I stand tall, two feet, ten toes
I don't care what I go through
I'ma stay down, I never fold
They say I'm slept on, but I bet I wake up a dreamer, though
She say she a squirter, when I hit her, she was creamin', though (Damn)

[Chorus: NLE Choppa]
Thug nigga, we trappin' in the moonlight
We get the bag gone the same day, the same night
Don't talk on tapped phones, you know the feds run devices
My mom my backbone, she stood by me wrong or right
Let me rewind this shit, gotta rewind that lick
I lost 'bout ten on that shit, I gotta go and get it back
Got 'bout forty on my wrist, I got 'bout two hoes on my dick
I know she seen me when I glisten, now she wanna take a pic

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Makin' a livin' while makin' a killin'
It don't make no sense, but shit, that's how I get it
I'm the example of hard work, commitment
The head of my clique, to move, they need permission
The plug for a lot of things, I'm the extension
Chords get struck, I got stripes with my chain gang, but motherfuck a prison
Niggas is stuck 'cause they ain't got intentions, boy, when you gon' get it?
To get it, you gotta give it, fuck the jealousy, all that resentment
The shit that you put out is only gon' come right back 'til you strengthen
To put this shit clearer, the world just a mirror
I'm up as I ever been, on an ascension, yeah
And I can't move iffy, the cameras go flicky
I roll with the blicky and I can't be trippin'
If I'm still alive, that shit ain't no biggie
I am B-I-G, though, the king of my city
And my bitch so down that she'd give me a kidney
Probably'd die for me, rather her live for me
Product of pain, I look what it did to me
I ain't no killer but, nigga, I'll kill you
If it ever had to come down to them or me
Move in divinity
I give a fuck if you get it, 'cause bitch, it ain't no gettin' rid of me

[Chorus: NLE Choppa]
Thug nigga, we trappin' in the moonlight
We get the bag gone the same day, the same night
Don't talk on tapped phones, you know the feds run devices
My mom my backbone, she stood by me wrong or right
Let me rewind this shit, gotta rewind that lick
I lost 'bout ten on that shit, I gotta go and get it back
Got 'bout forty on my wrist, I got 'bout two hoes on my dick
I know she seen me when I glisten, now she wanna take a pic

[Outro: NLE Choppa]
It seems like two wrongs don't make a right (Don't make a right)
But you gon' tell a lie so you won't hurt my feelings, right?
I'm gangster, the truth don't hurt me, it heals me (It heals me)
But thank you, I'ma make sure y'all feel me
