[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
I'm addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I'm addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law??
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hardtop
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up
Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise so my dawg can quit wearing
A .44 up on his waist like it's his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping "Ready or Not"
Who was just trying to do it big, but wasn't ready to die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive
Fuckin' right

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, J. Cole]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world (Cole World)
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world (Cole)
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world (Cole World)

[Verse 2: J. Cole & Big Sean]
Is this a dream? Well that's how it feel
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis, the menace to society
Check my sobriety, fuck hoes in varieties
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I'm getting dough man, these flows gon' retire me
Splurging all crazy
Switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerve)
Style on Nadal, I've been serving y'all lately, cheddar on Federer
Ball till I fall, et cetera, et cetera

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
(Yeah, yeah)
Grey wiley black stitching
On a train, same slang, plain Jane, the style is crispy
24 karats gazelles clear, yeah
I'm so fly real year
Price so la, feel weary
Besides killin gear
It's sniffin', plain white lines
But jumpin' off phenomenal missions
Yep drugs sellers that was in '88
Learned how to true
To shoot through, my cool escape
My Uncle huskie karate nigga die, who stayed in jail
He did a twenty piece
He came home, block movers still know who he is
To us we was kids he said, "Get rich and love life"
Don't fuck with no pigs yo, those days are hazed
Now we in chronic mode, no more plays
Runnin' up a rob a clothes, home or what
All we had was us and its sucks
The fly niggas is broke
Smoke coke, weed, and dust
I changed for the better, brand new Beretta
Slappin' a nigga face at the steal give me your leather
Through it all I learned a lot
Plus I burned a lot
The chronic now returned the clock

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, & Raekwon]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold (Yeah yo)
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Outro: Big Sean & Raekwon]
It wouldn't hurt so bad, I want you to know
It's the one and only dude, singing in tone, you dig?
And this is so many keys, the mixtape
Brought to you by my family
You already know what it is
Finally Famous over everything
My bro Key Wayne, my bro DJ Mo Beats, let's get it
Let's go, uh
