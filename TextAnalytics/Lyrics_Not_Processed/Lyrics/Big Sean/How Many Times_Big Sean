Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down
, oh, woah
We The Best Music
How many times I gotta?
Light another for the bitches who's just only in town
Another one
For the weekend, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown,

How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? (
Tunechi
)
I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wastin' time (
You know
)
You know how I feel about waitin' in line (
You know
)
You know he ain't it, girl, you're wastin' your time (
Ha!
)
You're only this young for a moment in time, take it in stride (
Woo!
)
How-how-how-how-how many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
(
How many times I gotta tell yo' ass?
 
Live life
)
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over? How many times I gotta? (
Come over
)
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side
How many times?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
How many times I gotta tell your ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell you I got a chauffeur?
Think about it, think it over
Everything is gon' be kosher
Call me when you gettin' closer
If you take a taxi, how much I owe ya?
Don't send me no naked pictures
If I can't get naked with ya
This dick deserve recognition
I don't mind payin' that commission
Is you with the shit or nah?
If we ain't fuckin' then, bitch, bon voyage
How many times? I said how many times?
Too many times and bitch, I ain't got time

[Chorus: Chris Brown, 
Lil Wayne

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, phone off the hook, yeah, that bitch won't stop blinkin'
I'll pick up for you though on the second ring
You've been drinkin' and drinkin', you're drinkin' for fun
And you drink for a reason
Yeah, leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leavin'
Callin' shots, refereein', no drama
Pussy so wet, I'ma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy, I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning
I'm dodgin' the leeches, I'm signin' agreements
I'm signin' new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimmin' with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixin', this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it, I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favorite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up

[Chorus: Chris Brown & 
Lil Wayne
]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side (
Hey
)
How many times?

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown, 
DJ Khaled
 & 
Both

Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down
, oh, woah
How many times I gotta?
Light another for the bitches who's just only in town
In town, in town
, for the weekend, oh
How many times?

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & 
DJ Khaled
]
I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwin' bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feelin' generous, throwin' my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm bonin'
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the mornin'
Got Xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, grippin' it, backin' me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwin'
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinkin' Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, droppin' that ass to a split
Talkin' 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whippin' the bricks, huh
Another one

Lil Wayne
