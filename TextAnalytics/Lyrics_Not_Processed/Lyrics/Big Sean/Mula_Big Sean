[Intro: Big Sean]
G.O.O.D.!
After God, after my family, I ain't gon' front
Ain't nothing more important than this success
Than getting it, yeah
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?
(Free OCB, Paperchaser)
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me?
(Doughboyz Cashout, whattup doe?)
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me? (Yup)
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me?
(I'mma tell you like a rich nigga told me, Finally Famous nigga)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Tell the police I'mma stack this paper 'til I overdose
Whodie holdie slowly back yo bitch ass up, you over close
I overflow all over hoes, my niggas is over hype
Shooting up your Phantom
Now they call your shit the Holy Ghost
Mercy, Lord would you please have mercy
And protect me from the hoes
That when life ainâ€™t sweet, they gon' desert me
Shut the fuck up and stand up when you see me
Like I'm the verdict
That's respect, now I got your wifey
And you back to using that Jergens
Hurting, sipping, spilling
Tipping, for my niggas who done passed way
Charge your ass a "fuck you" fee
And make you pay your tax today
I'm on a secluded island, swear it feel like 
Cast Away
Put that money in my shooter hands, and tell him blast away
I feel like getting paper is my destiny
'Til I rest in peace, get money recipe
Told my mom "Get what you want
Then just leave the rest to me"
Ain't no motherfucking rest for me

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Diamond rings, hundred chains, Slick Rick the ruler
I got cars, cribs all in my neck
Got them M's all in that bank
Griff, Blake all in that paint
Stacking bread, come watch me plank
Pray to never dying broke
Getting cases by the boat, we ain't shopping, buy the store
Shorty snorkel for that crab, eating lobster on my dinner plate
Stacking all this money homie, tryna see that ceiling break
Mula ain't everything homie, it's the only thing
Came from a hall of piss, straight to the hall of fame
Talk money, we got it, fuck boy, shoot your stylist
Eating good, I ain't brolic, I'm just chasing them commas
My niggas ride that five,
 and my bitch a ten
Got that China white, call it Jeremy Lin
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
My chain, a fridge, deep freezer, and a cooler

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah

[Outro: Big Sean]
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me?
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?
Where my fine freaks, fine freaks, fine freaks?
