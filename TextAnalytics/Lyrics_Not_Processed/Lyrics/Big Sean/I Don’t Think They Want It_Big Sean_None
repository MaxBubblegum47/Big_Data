I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
Soon as I walk in all the bad bitches on it
I saw you perform yeah, you put on a light show
I walk up in this bitch looking like a light show
Got a team but I’m by myself ISO
Killing shit lights on, lights on, lights off
On my job bitch, no nights off
And on my nights off, it still might cost
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
Your girls on my dick and she trying to sit up on it
She hopped on my lap even took a pick up on it
And I passed her to my niggas cause I don’t really want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
Brand new whip but I push it like it’s stolen
7-11 a nigga keep rollin’
I’m headed to the top bitch and I dont think you going
And how my checks look, stupid as hell
So tell me how my ex look, stupid as hell
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
Ay, now every time I stepped in
You could tell I stepped out
I saw your girlfriend only from the chest down
I’m so dressed up but I pull her dress down
By the time she wake up, I’m in the next town
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I met your main bitch and I put my niggas on it
And she bust it wide open, hotel picture phoning
Send it all around the World so I don’t even want it
2,3 I’m in my zone bitch
Where’s the competition?
I need a clone bitch
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
And I run GOOD music nigga Usain Bolt’n
Getting music so the drinks the only thing thats pouring
Damn thats what I like and it feel good
And it look right, tell her keep going
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
What you got? nothing!
What I got? everything!
You was straight gassin, I put that on kerosine
I just give her dick dog, you give her a wedding ring
You need her at the alter now that is just embarassing
Let em talk shit though, go ahead, carry on
I just walk up in this bitch higher than a carry on
Flyer than a carry on, sipping on Pérignon
Gripping on derriere, gripping off Derrion
Somebody show these weak niggas where the exit is
Cause they always trying to be where my section is
Ay for real though, the number one question is:
Why is your girlfriend always where the sexing is?
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
I Don’t Think They Want It
I-I Dont think they want it
