Alright, this one is a crazy one. I love this song. Tae beast produced this. he did an incredible job with it. I was actually... I had the first verse recorded and I was in the studio. I work out of no I.D.'s studio and big sean does as well. he's a good homie of mine. and at the time, I think he was doing some like photoshoot or something in the studio. and I'm blasting this record and he just jumps. he like comes through the door in the studio and he's like "what the hell is this man?" he's like "wussup boy." you know he's just like "what is this?" and I was like "oh, you like this" and he was like "fuck yeah, I like this, man" and I was like "oh shit, alright cool." and he's like "yo, wussup" and I'm like "what, you wanna get on it?" and he's like "yeah, let's go" and then I, that was kinda, that was, that was that. and I always wanted to work with sean, you know? I had always been a big fan long before I signed to no I.D. and worked with def jam and all that stuff so it was, it, it's crazy how full circle things have actually come not only while creating this album, but even, even after the album's been out. now that you're listening to it. everyday is a new adventure. um, everyday is something special, um, and you're a part of that, so thank you to spotify, thank you to the listener, thank you to everybody who is enjoying and sharing this album. I truly appreciate you taking the time to listen to me explain it as fast as I possibly could. um, so, yeah, and, uh, hopefully I will see you out there out there in the real world or at a show near you. alright, it's logic and that was under pressure. thank you very much
