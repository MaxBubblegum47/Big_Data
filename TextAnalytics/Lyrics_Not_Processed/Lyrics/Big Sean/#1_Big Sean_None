[Verse 1: Ro Spit]
Check, yeah, the track got hot once I got on
I wear my heart on my sleeve Comme Des Garcons
I know I’m the shit, my French Pardon
A king in the booth I get my troops march on
We outta here, bars drop ya thinkin’ I’m a enigma
Cause I been had swag back when it was charisma
You know I’m a champ by how I’m raisin' my fist to
Not be number one I couldn’t live with that stigma
I figure, I was at the top and I’ll never slump
Neva pump fake nigga I’d rather dunk
You feelin’ good about yourself go head bet a hun
I take ya girl then ya pride, then the cheddar come
You’ve neva won and ain’t dreamed about ever winnin'
Second place the highest place that you ever been in
I do whatever for the cheese, I’m forever grinnin’
This verse amazing and it couldn’t a had a better endin’

[Verse 2: CurT@!n$]
Curtains, I’m the best at it, number one
With the flow, KRS at it
And I’m handin’ out L’s like Nike I’m a chess addict
You try to battle but you lost like a Meth addict
I’m like Meth at it, I’m the fuckin’ man
I done ran them all like Cunningham
No gun in hand, but these warning shots
Try to diss me, then I’m on your block
You lookin’ shocked, like we done fucked up now
I stay in the cypher like puff, puff, pass
No Spliff, but I’m a star like Busta man
Already said it once, but I’m gone tell ‘em again
I’m number one, uno, no dos
I’m like an atheist I got no hope
For your week raps, you can keep that
I got the game all Twisted like Keith Sweat

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
What you know about, being the best at
Any place you reside or rest at
Used to have to check back, now I hand back checks
And can’t remember the last time I seen flat chests
Out of town luggage lookin’ like a chess match, Louis
Or a tournament, chain look like a ornament
Me and your bitch fornicate and she ain’t on no foreign shit
But I hit her from behind and leave a wet back
And then I pass out
Then I took ya girlfriend & turn her to my mascot
Hometown hero but I never pull my mask out
Bet the crowd love me love me like I hit the last shot
Sometime your first shot, can be your last shot
So see what I do when the ball get’s passed out
Yep, but everybody call me Big
Go hard or go home, so I don’t ever see the crib, bitch

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Say, I’m bout to handle my business, who is this
The Big Dawg of the South, don’t forget this
Now sit back and bear witness like LeBron
To the King, AKA boss I’m so the Don
All that, been that, now I’m ahead
On some other shit tryinna get my hands on my bread and don’t
Let it be said that I do not run it, run it
I bet you what you tried to do, I done done it
Ridin’ foreign cars, doin’ foreign shows
Makin’ foreign money, fuckin’ foreign hoes
Held down VIP and popped bottles
Made it rain up in the club and knocked models
Later for that mane, it’s all in the rear view
I got my eyes on the prize in the clear view
Ya gunnin’ for the top spot and yeah I hear you
But me I ain’t three and I’m nowhere near two
So looka here dude
