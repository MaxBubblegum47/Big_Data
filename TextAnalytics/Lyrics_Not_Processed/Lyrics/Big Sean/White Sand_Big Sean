[Chorus: Travis Scott & Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, white color sand (Yeah), frost in my hand, yeah (Yeah)
Lost in the game, yeah (It's lit), ghost, Danny Phantom (Oh yeah)
Dipped in a trance, yeah (alright), ten in the van, yeah
Ones make her leap, yeah, shh, not a squeak (Straight up)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign & Big Sean]
Coupe outside (Outside), she say let me ride
Bust down Rollie with the ice (Ice)
Ride 'round the city with a pipe
Wrist frozen (Frozen)
Blessed, I guess I'm chosen (Chosen)
Hit a lightskin from Oakland
In my old school sideshow
Supersport (Oh yeah)
Crash the Porsche (Oh yeah)
I was gettin' head (Woah)
She was killin' it (Woah)
Caught an Uber to the dealership (Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve)
Cash out on some new shit (Woah, look)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Bitch, I surround myself with all this loyalty
Swear to God I'm the one, my girl just might propose to me (I swear)
Clique full of CEO's (O's), none of us got a degree (No, no)
Made it from the underground, now they back tryna bury me (Bury me)
I lean, I sway (Woah), with Quay (Vo), and Tay (Koff)
I give and hardly take, you level up, I levitate
Bitch you a culture (What?), vulture (Woah), poser (Woah)
Hungry for exposure, I'm with my Migos soldiers, gone

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
White color sand, yeah (Yeah), frost in my hand, yeah
Lost in the game, yeah, ghost, Danny Phantom (It's lit)
Dipped in a trance, yeah (Alright), ten in the van, yeah
Ones make her leap, yeah, shh, not a squeak (Straight up)

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Drank color pink, dirty bags, wash it clean (Clean, yeah)
Coupe got wings (Coupe got)
Posted up with kings (Coupe got wings)
On the top like toupee (On top)
Play no games, no 2K (No 2K)
Crap game in the Blue Flame (Crap)
Pull out the coupe like Bruce Wayne (Skrrt skrrt)

[Verse 3: Offset]
Pull up the curtains to the Mulsanne (Hey)
Pavé my set and clip Blu-ray (Pavé)
Run to the bag like Usain (Bag)
When I lay my head down, got two K's (Baow)
Ferrari in Miami Beach (Ferrari)
I paid one twenty for rose Philippe (Philippe)
I took her soul for keeps, yeah (Soul)
Back to back Rolls like Meech (Meech)
Check my balance, the cash I'ma double up (Bag)
P-90, two-three with the monkey nuts (Brrt)
When I look at my wrist it's a hockey puck (Woo)
When I get with a bitch I'ma pipe her up (Hey)
Pour that lean on that ice (Lean)
Leaving my dreams covered in ice (Dream)
Wedding band rings, ain't no wife
Tryna get the demons out of my sight (Woo)

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Nigga we ain't hiding we straight (Nope)
I'm talking big plate with that steak (Steak)
Niggas be watchin' out 'cause they scoping (Watchin')
Geeked off of Adderall, they all focused (Acid)
Sipping on Tylenol, having codeine withdrawls
A nigga must got to be joking (Joking)
Don't want the pack, it ain't potent (Uh)
Look at wrist, water came from the ocean (Ice)
I'm laughing, never lacking (No)
Everlasting, flipping work like gymnastics (Flippin' it)
Wrapping it up in the plastic (Wrappin' it)
Smoking it up in the ashes (Ashes)
Looking and watching which ass is gon' be the fattest (Asses)
I pick the bitch up and smash it
2018 we don't pass, we trash it

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, white color sand, yeah (Yeah), frost in my hand, yeah
Lost in the game, yeah, ghost, Danny Phantom (It's lit)
Dipped in a trance, yeah (Alright), ten in the van, yeah
Ones make her leap, yeah, shh, not a squeak (Straight up)

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Drank color pink, dirty bags, wash it clean (Clean, yeah)
Coupe got wings (Coupe got)
Posted up with kings (Coupe got wings)
On the top like toupee (On top)
Play no games, no 2K (No 2K)
Crap game in the Blue Flame (Crap)
Pull out the coupe like Bruce Wayne (Skrrt skrrt)
