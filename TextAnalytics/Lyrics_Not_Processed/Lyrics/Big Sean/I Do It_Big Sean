[Intro]
I do it
Fuck yo time, nigga
I do it, boi
Nigga fuck yo time nigga

[Verse 1]
I waited my whole life to be the man of the hour, I really can’t lie
I was the man when I started, I'll be the man when I die
Man these hoes, take your money and I take they virginity
I’m high, I split an O in half, now it’s a parenthesis
Crazier than crazy, ape shit, retardedly stupid
I put that weed in the air and pass it, yep, that's alley-oopin
Okay now, oh that's yo girl? Well I don’t give a mass of two shits
Okay I’m west side, west side 'til I’m died and underneath them tulips
You bordo like Enrique,
 I’m too paid, I’m three-paid
I’m looking like I’mma sweep stakes but I treat ya girl like a cheap skate
Cause I need a crib, a big estate, I need a boat and that need a lake
I need some salmon, that need a plate that need a chef so I feed my safe
My crew is who I’d be widdidy-wid-it, Rose I sippity-sip-it
I’m Quagmire I fuck hoes, my cashflow I "giggity-get" it
Boy, I’m cock-a-mamian, the most zaniest, insaniant
Pulling up in Merced-iance (Ballin'), 
rolling up like I’m Damian (Marley)
I love girls that Arabian, Albanian, Caucasian
I ride around gettin cranium cause my dick is hard as titanium
Oh boy you had your chance and blew it (You blew it)
Stand aside and watch a real nigga do it, bitch

[Hook]
I feel like the world mine
Just bow down, the world mine
I’mma let you live, the world mine
This world mine

[Verse 2]
The one and only in this mothafucka
Niggas staring like we the only ones in this mothafucka
How could you not know we in this mothafucka
I got my haters looking lonely in this mothafucka
Whoa, I’m sipping on whatever I get handed
Throwing house parties so crazy that my crib look like a campus
Play your cards right and I could blow you up nah, I ain't gambit
Shit, I’m wasted-wasted, this looks like a job for Captain Planet
Nah-nah, good lordy, whoadie, I just took more shots than Kobe
The realest niggas is reppin', the baddest bitches promoting
She put that thong on my groin-groin and then it go boing!
Got my fronter on her bumper does it look like she towing
I hustle hard like I’m finna lose the crib
And party hard like I’m finna do it big
All I ever do is big, so all she wanna do is Big
Girl, what your name is, I really can’t remember
And Tone breaking tree down, somebody yell out timber
I’m up up in them Kush clouds, lighting up like I’m Zeus
Bitch stand back watch how a real nigga do it

[Hook]
I feel like the world mine
Just bow down, the world mine
I’mma let you live, the world mine
This world mine
