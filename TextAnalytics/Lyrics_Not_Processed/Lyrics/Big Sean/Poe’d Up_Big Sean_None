[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah, okay
It's G.O.O.D music
B.I.G., Fly U

[Verse 1: Jerreau (Fly Union)]
Look, it's The Greater Than Club
If she ain't 8 or greater, no autographs or hugs
And we gone get poe'd up, like nobody know us
Like Sean ain't finally famous, like Fly U is unheard of
BBC, Louis V, you see the company, I keep
I cloud hop, I name drop when I speak
So what's ya first and last name, don't call or text me
I need a girl with manners, that can please me
But baby, I don't want it if it's that easy
I ain't the same man I used to be a day ago, let alone a year ago
That's why I used to have more rolls, now it's just more clothes and more O's

[Hook: Jerreau]
Girls these days ain't nothing but trouble
Girls these days ain't nothing but trouble
Let's get poe'd up, a lot of women in here
Let's get poe'd up, a lot of women in here
Girls these days ain't nothing but trouble
Girls these days ain't nothing but trouble
Let's get poe'd up, a lot of women in here
Let's get poe'd up, a lot of women in here

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
And I'ma make her act accordingly
She gone say my name, say my name, like she supporting me
Bunch of bitches stepping in, looking like sororities
Half white, half black, looking like minorities
"Go Sean, go, Go Sean, go!"
But if that bitch ain't got no rubbers than it's, "No, Sean, no!"
See I'm draped in all this Louis Vuitton
One thing she'll never ask her girlfriends is, "Who is Sean?"
And the bra and panties matching like a uniform
Ass like a horse, so, if I pipe her to the head, she'll be looking like a unicorn
B.I.G., smell a wiffy of this izzy, with my Jesus chain on
So, I'm feeling like Biggie

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Iyeball (Fly Union)]
It's like AA
She in my kitchen fixing eggs
With my Bathing Ape hoodie on, she not leaving with that
She poured a glass of OJ, trying to reflect like..
"I don't remember nothing, I don't be drinking like that"
I'm like, "You don't 'member? I passed that bottle to you"
"Take me to yo crib, tryna see just how you live, heard it's luxurious"
Backed it up said, "It's legit!" So, I took a swing and hit
Now she acting like she didn't, but she did
