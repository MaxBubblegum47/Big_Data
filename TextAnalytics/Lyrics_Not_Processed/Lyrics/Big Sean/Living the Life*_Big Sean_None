[Intro]
On the come up
On the come up
Sun up
Bunch of young niggas on the come up
Come up
Gun up
All my young niggas on the come up
Bunch of young niggas on the come up

[Verse]
All my niggas live Italian
Eating spaghetti and salad
Last night, she just fucked a stallion
Inside of a palace
All my niggas live Italian
Loyalty is all I'm askin'
Wearing diamond medallions, (straight up)
My whole squad run the atlas
Look, I feel like I was chose to the take
Care of the ones I'm close to
Kitchen looking like whole foods
Got the fam around like it's soul food
Damn, I do this shit for the set
Working all year till we set
Quick to check a bitch, yeah, I check her even though life's a game of chess
Cause I'm living play by play, day by day
No time for her honestly
And her face looking like a young shawty
Cause I gotta get it a hundred ways
But you know 'bout being down and out...
