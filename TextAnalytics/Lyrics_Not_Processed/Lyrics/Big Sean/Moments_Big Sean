[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
These are the moments in time that we've been waiting our whole life to find
That we've been searching for all through the night
Just tell me it will be alright
'Cause, baby, in a world full of cancer
Where everyone needs a ransom
My mama said "love is the answer"
So when I call you better answer me
Right now I need you here on me
No substitutes, you're the one and only
Please take away the stress I don't need
You got me on my knees, baby, James Brown, please
The time is ours, not for borrow
Both got a past full of sorrow
Let's cancel everything tomorrow

[Hook: Jhené Aiko]
I always get caught in the moment
With you, with you
With you, with you
With you, with you
I get caught in the moment
With you, with you
With you, with you
With you, with you
I get caught in the moment

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Hey, the past, that's history
The future, that's a mystery
The present, that's a gift, that's why they call it the present
I can't watch the news lately, it's been too depressing
I'd rather be with you, bodies pressing and decompressing
So much smoke in the air, it's like we need decongestant
I know you need protection
I tell you what to do whenever you need direction
You know I'm overworkin', and I cut the check like director
Take me daily, as directed
'Cause, baby, in a room full of dancers
You still are the answer
These other hoes nothing to focus on
I need somebody real to get close up on
Looking for someone who don't annoy you when they overstaying
It's looking like I am like one A.M
I could put you to sleep faster than melatonin
Us zoning, wishing I could freeze-frame the moment

[Hook: Jhené Aiko & Big Sean]
Oh yeah
With you, with you
With you, with you
With you, with you
I get caught in the moment
With you, with you
With you, with you
With you, with you
I get caught in the moment

[Bridge: Jhené Aiko]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hol' up
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
You better freeze the moment, seize it, own it
Focus is on it, our time to go in
'Yo time be on it
Lose yourself and find something you won't let escape the moment, yeah
Everything you need to be contented is right here
Right in this minute
You can have it when you understand that all that matters is right here
