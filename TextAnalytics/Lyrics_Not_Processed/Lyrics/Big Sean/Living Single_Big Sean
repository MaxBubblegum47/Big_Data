[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, look

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it's the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls
Pussy get wet as an S-Curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like "I got some hoes, hit me back"
Fuck it

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby, we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I done have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more
Like my nigga Henry, he married at 24
I'm like why nigga, why?
You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
He like, "ahhh"
Fuck it, we about to do therapy
Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm carefree with no plan b's
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
Itâ€™s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how when I'm with her I feel whole too
Go on, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
Even though he on target with everything I've been missing
The closest thing I had to that came in at 4 AM and out at 8 for work
And I'm the reason we ain't make it work
That's what makes it worse
Damn

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
