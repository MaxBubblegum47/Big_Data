I blew it
I blew it
I blew it
I waisted my whole life to be the man of the hour, I really can’t lie
I dissapointed when I started, I'll dissapoint until I die
Man these hoes, look for money so I keep my virginity
Can't bag, not at RHS, or even Holy Trinity
Crazier than Kwazy, ape shit, retardedly stupid
I kick that soccer ball in gym, yet, got accuracy like cupid
Okay now, oh that's yo girl? Well I don’t give a mass of two shits
My feelings are inside, inside 'til I’m riding underneath them Tulips
You bordo like Enrique, I’m toupee, My phone pre-paid
I’m looking like I’m a cheap skate but I treat ya girl like a sweepstake
Cause I clean the crib, frebreeze I spray, so parents give me money and I take
I need some dough, so we can go, and get Wendy's, for wallet's sake
Shoulders on, I cryity-cry , no lip balm so dryity-dry
I’m olive oil, that's well known, no cashflow, no flyity-fly
Boy look like he's wiltin', vans tiltin', no guilt in
Sarcasm is built in, runnin' like I'm on stilts and
I love girls that are unattainable, unrelatable, unavailable
No relationships that are stable, watchin' basic cable
Oh boy I had my chance to do it (But didn't)
Let me show you how I really went and blew it(bitch)
