Big Sean in the building
Yeah, I'm in the building man
Oh, we 'bout to go in, baby
G.O.O.D. Music in the building
Whatchu know about that
Boi, boi
Yes, no cursing, right
Yo, do what you can do
Tell me when It's possible man
I do it, do it, do it

[Big Sean]
Man, D-Town in here
I say, I say, oh my God
I can't tell what's a better accessory
My new watch, or the chick that's standin' right next to me
Killin' niggas that rap
But bein' the man is my specialty
I love ishin' on all my exes, especially
Oh-oh-oh-oh, boi I'm dumb high
Dumb high, yeah from the Westside -itch
Slow it down like I got my thumb high
I got 'em on they knees
Like I got my gun high
I'm in my old-school
I feel like the alumni
Yikes
Car lookin' like it's sittin' on thirty floors
Thirty doors
Thirty whores
Few black bitches and Fergie whores
This shit look like Jersey Shore
I'm on fire boi, loose cannon
My car's Bruce Wayne
I feel like I'm Bruce Banner
I'm ripping clothes off
Car's so big
When I whip that shit
Don't stand too close
When I hit them curbs
Muh-fucka might rip them toes off
I said B-I-G, I'm that important
You spent all day with her spooning
I spent all night with her forking, what
Ridin' low, puffing on loud
I came way too far to -uck it up now
Texts from my mom say
Me and your Grandma proud
Came way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Teacher told me
Get a job, save up for 401k
I'd rather be young as hell counting 401k
I'ma probably die gettin' some head
I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs
B-I
What
But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch I better get the debit if I don't get the cred
That I deserve
Uhh
Yo, I say
From the Westside
I look like pocka
Where they pop your block up
A block up
Big Poppa
Flock off
You holy little woahdy holy Kenobi, Chewbacca
I'm Balenciaga, Erhman, Chanel
But I bet you that you won't find it
Rockin' Louie and MCM guess I'm clothes-minded
Obama suite
You one below up in that Joe Biden
I'm in ya city just chillin'
Where all ya -oes hidin'
20k for the fifth because it's 24-karats
I can't lie, the price probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-Town reppin' (KEEP GOING!)
And making all them niggas who second-guessed it, regret it
Regret it like half the -oes I smashed in the sheets
At least now I realize how much I love [Assy?] Marie
When it's all said and done I'll probably give her my name
She put too many games not to have her a ring, boi
What, keep goin'
Big Sean in the building, keep going. Keep going
Yeahh, yeah, uhh
I don't care, keep going
Old raps, new raps, whatever, we do it
Come Up Show Cosmic Kev, Big Sean baby
Uhh, yeahh, yeahh, uh, uh
I said B-I, B-I
Bitch I do it to death
If I come in with half
Bet I leave with the rest
You might be cool gettin' 50 percent
And I'm like, fuck you doing
I need Diddy percent
Got a million on line one
And another mill' dialin' in
Mama on line four
Telling me how much not to spend
'Ye on line three
Telling me how we 'bout to win
You on hold trying to get conferenced in
Man, I just gotta have it
Imagine it, make it happen
I dreamed about it then grabbed it
My life is a fuckin' movie
The baddest bitches get casted
I'm in a race with myself
To see who can get it the fastest, huh
Sippin' on sh- older than me
The warmer the weather
The colder the drink

[Big Sean speaking to Cosmic Kev]
Alright man, look, I gave a lot
Pshhh

Y'all gotta go get the album
That's just a couple bars
Big Sean in the building, oh man
