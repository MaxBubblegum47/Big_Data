[Intro: Big Sean, 
Jamie Foxx
 & 
Future
]
Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
Metro on the beat, Metro on the beat
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Big Sean]
You know I change with the seasons (Yeah, I change, change)
The same way I'm comin', bitch, I'm leavin' (Yeah, I'm out)
And when I'm gone you won't see me (Gone)
Unless you give me a reason

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
V-12, I got a need for speed (Skrrt, skrrt)
Only time I'm slowin' down is in between her knees (Uh-huh)
Might tell her ass to leave when I need to breathe (Woah)
Lil Metro on the beat, push the keys with ease
I flew out every airport, of course, God is my source (Source)
When you do the numbers, it gets taxin' of course (Course)
Somehow I just kept it twenty-five times four (Woah)
Kill the shows, kill the pussy, they both want an encore (woah)
Like go, Don, go (Go), gave everybody 'round me jobs
Fuck a job corps, bitch we on the top floor (Top)
Workin' like we still tryna get it off the ground though (Woah)
And if you not contributin', bitch, then fuck you 'round for? (Huh?)
And if I split these blessings with you, you my brother (You my brother)
If I don't text you back, then I don't trust you (Then I don't trust you)
If I pick up on the first, brrt, I love you (Yeah, I love you)
And if I tell you all my secrets, you my lover, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
You know I change with the seasons (Yeah, I change, change)
The same way I'm comin', bitch, I'm leavin' (Yeah, I'm out)
And when I'm gone you won't see me (Gone)
Unless you give me a reason
You know I move with the seasons (Seasons)
The same way I'm comin', bitch, I'm leavin' (Yeah, I'm leavin')
And when I'm gone you won't see me (You won't see me)
Unless you give me a reason

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
Yo, them girls don't need me (Ooh)
I learned them girls don't need me (Bye, bye)
Girls don't need me (Bye, bye)
So why do they always hate to leave me? (Ooh)
Remove my pants, I won't be needin' these (Ooh)
Pretty girl gon' tell me, "Pretty please" (Bye, bye)
I change like the season (Bye, bye)
My old girls, I really don't see them

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I think these boys don't like me, wanna fight me? (Don't like me, wanna fight me?)
But they don't talk to my face like they do on IG (Lil' bitch)
I guess it bring the best out of me when they doubt me, for sure (Yeah)
Fucked up how my mind be, maybe the mayhem calm me (Uh-huh)
Bring competition 'round me, eat 'em alive like zombies (Like that)
I think I got insomnia, up all night to the mornin' (Woah)
Turn my phone off 'cause I got a higher callin' (Brrt)
And for the gold medal, I keep my foot on the pedal (Woah)
Keep my girls on rose petals, keep runnin' into the devil (Oh)
Beat his ass every time, next time, I'ma bring a shovel
To put his ass in the dirt and then laugh 'til it hurt
And I'm in rare form like Jordan Airborne
I'm here, there, and gone, lowkey it's baritone
She love my pheromones, I'm 'bout to take this trip
And I can hold your hand instead of this carry-on, gone

[Chorus: Big Sean & 
Swae Lee

And when I'm gone you won't see me (You won't see me)
