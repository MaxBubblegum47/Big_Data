(One of these days and it won't be long)
Atone ,what up
(One of these days and it won't be long)
Its Big Sean Detroit baby

[Big Sean]
I’m sunning niggas like daytime, damn
I guess it cuz I’m dope like bass lines, pause
Cuz they catching on late like dateline
I’m tired of playtime its time to take mine
Ain’t no coincidence that every bitch wanna date Sean
If she told different little nigga then they lying
Only difference is I do this shit and they straight trying
If that ain’t the truth bitch then the pigs is straight flying
(woo) I gotta breathe started with a dream but now its all in reach
Sheesh I hear them haters they keep talking
Im on top now, F all them
Cuz they falling, like Autumn
And wish that they was close to Sean like Marlon (damn)
And you can ask Atone while y’all stayed home
This what we stayed on to make it out
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long

[Atone]
Its ya mans Atone, listen up...
What I'm manifestin is  destined to be interestin'
Devastating like a C section
Hard body like a erection
You see him dawg he flexing
Perpetrating wack verbalation
Percolating like he ice skating
And he wonder why we hating
The fake work he making
Like he really put in work to make it
His chain hanging I should take it
But I ain’t like that
Just introduce me to the right track
And say fuck it like we naked
I don’t ever feel disrespected
Cuz I know I’m on the right track
Doing what I can to make it
From the heart I can never fake it
From the soul and I hold it sacred
Intellectual vocation
Unite the whole nation
While i'm on an international vacation
Holy carnations
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
One of these days and it won't be long
