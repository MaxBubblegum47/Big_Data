[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I'm broken in pieces down to the soul
I know the whole world can feel it
I know that they can see it (Oh), uh
Oh, I hate to admit that I need you, I need you, I need you
Next to me
You said that you would ride for me
And I hear you
But right now I need to feel you right next to me
'Cause this is all I got, prove that you got me
(Oh yeah) Oh yeah, yeah
(Broken pieces)
'Cause this is all I got, prove that you got me

[Chorus: Earlly Mac, Anderson .Paak & Both]
Yeah
So if you say, "Nigga," then I'ma say, "Is that a Ritz?" Mmm
Ooh, fifty niggas deep (Deep), hundred niggas step
Million Man March (Mmm), cracker, don't you start (Yeah)
Hold yo' head, guard yo' heart
Hold yo' head, uh
Nigga, get yo' bread, uh, light yo' spark
Strike yo' mark, life don't stop
So hold yo' hеad, guard yo' heart
Hold yo' head, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean, Anderson .Paak & Wale]
Conflictеd in this free-based world of give and take (Take)
'Cause I always rather give than to be the one sayin' thanks (Woah)
Conflicted like bein' signed to Ye and managed by Jay
Conflicted like bein' cool with Pusha and Drake (Damn)
Conflicted like reppin' a city where I hardly stay (Stay)
Or knowin' that you wrong but it's too hard to say
Hold yo' head (Hold yo' head), guard your heart (Guard your heart)
In my life, those were the hardest parts (Yeah)
So many dark times, I wish I caught a spark
Or learned not seein' eye to eye could be fixed with a heart to heart (God)
So many lost, I feel lost, got me feelin' like a real nigga, Holocaust
Got me mournin' while it's dark (Dark)
Life'll eat you alive, we know how to be a meal
Shit, rather than see a mill', to make it out, you need a skill (Yeah)
Thought I was past my past, but let's be clear (Clear)
Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear (Swerve)
Regrettin' everything in life is my only fear (My only fear)
And you know what they say about not conquerin' fears (What?)
If you don't, then they'll always be near
As that reminder in your ear, shit that I ain't tryna hear (Nah)
Hold yo' head (Hold yo' head), guard your heart (Guard your heart)
In my life, those were the hardest parts (Swerve)
Oh, you mistake me fallin' down for fallin' off (Woah)
Or mistake me bein' soft for speakin' from the heart
I guess life hasn't taught you as much as you thought
Instead of pickin' up your missin' pieces, you pick me apart (God)

[Verse 3: Wale & Big Sean]
Boy, hold your head but guard your heart
Got tired of white silence, so the riots started
And the robbers robbed, you wylin' 'cause yo' product gone?
We mad that Eric Garner, Breonna, Gianna father gone
Yeah, a lot of trauma, we tired, exhausted
Ermias the prophet said it'd be a marathon, look
Seen all my dawgs shown me God was watchin' (Woah)
Pandemic slowin' 'em down, they fastin', Ramadan
The land of fifty stars, on Hollywood marchin'
White friends don't got us, I promise you, I'll block 'em (Straight up)
I'ma count my bread, I defied the odds
And fuck the Saint quarterback 'cause he ain't Saint Laurent
Boy, from here on out, we on Peyer Moss
If we leave Reebok, we still bring 'em pumps and all the broads
Yeah, I motivate (I motivate), I don't divide (I don't divide)
The 45 a coward for practicing otherwise
A burnt nation, still it's under God
Not gonna throw the towel in, I'm by my brother's side
Your niggas be yo' niggas when you level up
You see that yo' niggas and brothers different when luck is up
So I trust nothing, this industry's something
My biggest rival is my mind protecting my thoughts
As well as my heart

[Chorus: Earlly Mac]
It's fifty niggas deep, hundred niggas step
Million Man March, cracker, don't you start
Hold yo' head, guard yo' heart
Hold yo' head, uh
Nigga, get yo' bread, uh, light yo' spark
Strike yo' mark, life don't stop
So hold yo' head, guard yo' heart
Hold yo' head, yeah
