Verse 1:Strap
She won't let me go
She won't let me go
Looked me in my eyes, and told me "baby no"
Spend a night in that pussy and then I gots to go
She tried to hide my keys
Don't want me to go, back out that door
Don't want me to go back on that road
Say I always touch her soul
Say her man don't do her like I do her
Say it's nothing wrong with me and you
You just tell me how you feelin'
I might come and scoop you baby, and put you on that pimpin'
You could ease your mind, relax your bones
Took you off his arm, he ain't on the shit I'm on
Take you to the club, you had the time of your live and drink Patron
Pour you some Rosay and now you drankin', what I'm drankin' on

All around the globe
Everywhere I go
Surrounded by them hoes
I swear she won't let me go
She won't let me go, (do it) (2x)

Emblem on my car, (boi)
Used to be yo girl, (boi)
But now she on my arm
She won't let me go, (do it) (3x)
Verse 2:Ali
She won't let me go because I hit that pussy right
All night
And when I hit it, man she keep that pussy tight
That's what I like
And if I'm tipsy, then I might give that pussy bites
But ain't no drinking red wine
Because my floor is all white, okay
So hit me up today
Maybe we'll hook up today
Hope you ain't got plans today
Trynna take yo pants away
Lightin' up some candles babe
So enjoy the moment cause later I gotta go away
Girl my ice on, my ice on
I fuck her with the lights on, the lights on
I hope Pandora play the right song, the right song
I'mma hit it all night long, night long

Verse 3:Quez
I put her hands over her head
Then I picked her up, and then I laid her on the bed
Then I spread her legs
And then I licked her on her neck
Then I told her, "Girl it's gone be something you won't forget"
And then she scream "Quez, I like that"
Don't bite me girl, cause I bite back
And we tangled and twisted
And she say she like my chain, the way it twinkle and glisten
Baby I'm the quarterback, so baby play your position
I said, "Girl I gotta go, girl I gotta leave"
Did it two times, say she want a round three
Puttin on my jacket, she start pulling on my sleeve
She say that she's addicted and can't get enough of me

Emblem on my car, (boi)
Used to be yo girl, (boi)
But now she on my arm
She won't let me go, (do it) (3x)
