Big Sean & Jhené Aiko

Don't just take your clothes off, take the problems off
Take the armor off, take all the drama off
Let go of your responsibilities you been holdin' down
Know it's a lot on your mind, but I need your focus now
I need that (
Soulful moanin'
), yeah
I give you that (
Soulful moanin'
), yeah
(
Late night conversation, can you speak my body language?
)

[Refrain: Jhené Aiko]
Bring that body to me
Baby, come closer, closer
Bring it to me
Oh, yeah, baby, I'll give you ecstasy
Baby, come closer, closer
Bring it to me, ooh, yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & 
Big Sean

Girl, I'm talkin' body to body
Cheek to cheek, soulful moanin'
And girl, your lips taste so sweet
Girl, I'm talkin' body to body
Cheek to cheek (
I'll give you that
), soulful moanin' (
Yeah, fuckin' right
)
Ooh, yeah (
Yeah
), ooh, yeah (
Yeah
)
Look

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I know, I had people in my circlе but they weren't in my cornеr
I had people in my business, but they didn't support it
But took advantage of me like they supposed to do with their moments
Everything you didn't do, but could've did if you wanted
Working overtime, it's time I could be taking you down
Real shit, I gotta quit acting like these niggas don't want my place
When I ain't around, even though niggas ain't threats
I know if I don't live with you, I gotta live with regrets
I might walk in while you showering
Hit you in yo' shower cap, you gripping on the towel rack
I'm bussin' while you buss back
In the bathtub pouring champagne on that ass like I'm Dame Dash
Goddamn, yo' last nigga blew it with his lame ass

[Refrain: Jhené Aiko]
Bring that body to me
Baby, come closer, closer
Bring it to me
Oh, yeah, baby, I'll give you ecstasy
Baby, come closer, closer
Bring it to me, ooh, yeah

[Verse 3: Jhené Aiko]
Late night conversations, can you speak my body language?
I ain't got no time to waste, you got me losing patience
I can't wait to get you over here and get you naked
I'm about to ride that dick so crazy, I might break it
I'm so horny, show me something
Body to body, cheek to cheek, soulful moaning

[Refrain: Jhené Aiko]
Bring that body to me
Baby, come closer, closer
Bring it to me
Oh, yeah, baby, I'll give you ecstasy
Baby, come closer, closer
Bring it to me, ooh, yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, I'm talkin' body to body
Cheek to cheek, soulful moanin'
And girl, your lips taste so sweet
Girl, I'm talkin' body to body
Cheek to cheek, soulful moanin'
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

[Outro: Big Sean & 
Ty Dolla $ign
]
In the city of murder, mayhem and narcotics
We got enough problems
Now it's time for that (
Soulful moanin'
)
(
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
)
