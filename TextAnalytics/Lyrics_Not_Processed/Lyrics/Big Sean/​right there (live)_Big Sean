[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Woo, y'all ready to throw it back one time?
Let's go
Put your hands up, oh hey, yeah
Put your hands up, put your hands up, darling

[Refrain: Ariana Grande & Big Sean]
(You got it, you got it, babe)
You got it (You got it, babe)
Oh baby (You got it, you got it, babe)
Ooh (Sean Don, you got it, you got it, babe)

[Verse 1: Big Sean with Ariana Grande]
Okay, this, this
This one for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model, God
Doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need (Ayy)
I know what you like (Ayy)
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright (Hey)
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Hey, I really love you, I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
(You should know) Know
(I'm never gonna change) I'm never gonna change
(I'm always gonna stay) I'm always gonna stay
(You call for me, I'm right there) I'm right there
(Right there) Ooh
('Cause you listen and you care) And you care, baby
(You're so different, no one compares)
(And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there)
(I'll always be right there)
