Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?

[Verse 1]
You can't afford the price, so why the hell would you ask it?
These faggots try and snatch it, get they ass in a casket
Ya honey love me, she admire the fashion
And I call her baby girl, just like her dad did
There's 100's on my paper like a smart ass class kid
Because I'm on top my route, like an ad lib
And you should holla mamma, Dolce and Gabbana mamma
Gotta a whole lot o' mamma, Fendi and the Prada so you need to
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
But to get boy you gotta be rich or something
And my attire hard, hard like my dick or something
I made more then ends meat
My nigga BIG told me he was bout the Benji's
I'm in the lime light 'til the point my skin green
And living my dreams 'til the point you should pinch me to convince me

[Hook]
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard

[Verse 2]
If I told you where to get it, you niggas still wouldn't grab it
Just to pronounce it, you gotta add an accent
And they ask, can they call me grocery store?
Cause my pockets full of paper and plastic
Man, you not avoiding my Asian persuasion
Excuse the lil Ape in ya face, it stays Bathing
And when the heat blaze on high beams
You scream, I scream
For some cold ass ice cream
You need to gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Pose for the hoes, they might wanna take a pic or something
Hop up in the ride, they might wanna let me stick or something
There's some things, I don't like, I love them Nike's
But not the white on white's, forget the price tags
Cause I get what I like, and your girl looking for me
Because she like the pipe, ya dig?

[Hook]
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?
Well you need to, gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some

[Verse 3]
Dog, the fabric on my ass is satin and its sad n
You think you could afford this fabric
When it comes to the hoes I'm the man like Shaft is
Cuz I'm clean cut and handle them like baggage
Atheists turn Christian when I rock my True Religions
Dog, It's that real when I'm rockin pastelle?
These niggas wanna wonder what they have on me?
I'm stickin to my roots like LRG
Go n getcha some, go go an getcha some (x2)
Pose for the hoes they might wanna take a pic or somethin
Hop up in the ride they might wanna let me stick em some
The rag 'round my neck complement the outfit
I'm out with brawds you be watchin from your couches
But I'mma need money power respect
Find a little piece of Jesus and I threw em round my neck
That's

[Hook]
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?
Well you need to, gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon' gon' getcha some
