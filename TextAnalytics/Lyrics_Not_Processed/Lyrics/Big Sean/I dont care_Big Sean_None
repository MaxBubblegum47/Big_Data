I don’t care   by Danlocz ft. Jameal

Spiting fire like a dragon
Theses b****** on my band wagon
Got flows for days
Get h*** for days
Getting h*** no fade
Count on bread straight dope
Ill bow to ya both
I’ll break your Kevin heart
Boy you call me a joke
I told your b****
Let’s catch a movie at six
She said she wanna see titanic
So I showed her my d***
My rapping legit
My rapping is s***
She call me rubber band man
Then lick on my tip
So I duck
And I dip
Your b**** quick to strip
She doing these flips
On my d***
B****I know I’m the s***
When I spit
You I’m a pimp
Eaten on shrimp
B**** quit talking
And suck on this d***
Tell yall eat a c*** b*****
Man n**** shut up
Why you still talking
Tryna focus on my music
Slash money ain’t a problem
But talking why you talking
Started B**** bout your feelings
Started caring what I do
N**** That’s my decision (what you tell em)
I don’t care
I don’t care
I don’t care
Whoop di whoop
Whoop di whoop whoop
I don’t care
I don’t care
I don’t care
Whoop di whoop
Whoop di whoop whoop
I tell my b**** quite playn
And make a decision
I got too many h***
For you to get my permission
No I don’t
Yes do
Cause if I don’t I’m a lose
Stop that didn’t even rhyme
I’m wasting my time
I think I’m a die
Like Pac in his prime
I spit on my flow
You rapping you known
My lyrics so cold
Like Cole J
Born with a sinner face
Devil with a halo
That’s what shady say
What shady say
I’m a tell you if its whack
Street love
Manplay it back
When I heard that
I loved that
But I’m off track
And I did it perfectly
So you can remember me
Danlocz not danlocs
That’s danjokes
That’s funny s***
Funny s***
You laugh and s***
Put this s*** up in your mouth
Now you talking s***
You dumb b****
Spit it out then flush it
Spitting flows
Little h***
Crime city
Ain’t no more
Yall kept s***
Yall trill s***
Yall young nation s***
Yall bluff s***
Two b***in my mouth
Now I smoke s***
Man n**** shut up
Why you still talking
Tryna focus on my music
Slash money ain’t a problem
But talking why you talking
Started B**** bout your feelings
Started caring what I do
N**** That’s my decision (what you tell em)
I don’t care
I don’t care
I don’t care
Whoop di whoop
Whoop di whoop whoop
I don’t care
I don’t care
I don’t care
Whoop di whoop
Whoop di whoop whoop
Money on my mind
So I gotta pay attention
How we gonna pay attention
When our minds stay trippin
I forgot to mention
We smoke w*** for a living
What you saying
Cush blunts got me high pass heaven
OH s***
I’m seeing doubles
What’s about you
Me too
B***** loving the crew
No drizzy but the model true
I’m f***** her and her to
Third wheel f***** around
Man n**** shut up
Why you still talking
Tryna focus on my music
Slash money ain’t a problem
But talking why you talking
Started B**** bout  your feelings
Started caring what I do
N**** that’s my decision (what you tell em)
I don’t care
I don’t care
I don’t care
Whoop di whoop
Whoop di whoop whoop
I don’t care
I don’t care
I don’t care
Whoop di whoop
Whoop di whoop whoop
