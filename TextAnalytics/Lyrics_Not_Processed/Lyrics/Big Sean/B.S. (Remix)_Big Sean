[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
Yeah
Yeah
Uh
Back up on my b—
Done dealing with you
Yeah

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Back up on my bullshit, back up on the scene
Done dealing with you, don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back

[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
It seem like I give so much and don't get nothin' back
I really thought it was love, but you're so fuckin' wack
Always get caught up in love, but I am done with that
I can't get caught up in love, so now I'm— Yeah
Flexin' on my exes in my Model X
Pretty little skinny, little-bitty body, model-esque
Some of y'all ain't never had no real bitch and it shows
I keep it one hunnid from my head down to my toes
Back up on my bullshit, back up on the move
Touch down in my hometown, got nothing to lose
I am on my own now, I am in control now
I need you to go now, I can fix my own crown

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Back up on my bullshit, back up on the scene
Done dealing with you, don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back, yeah, bitch

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Back on my bully, back on my diss you in the studio
Back on tequila, back on the strippers or the groupie hoes
This could get ugly, I'm petty, I want you, 'bout all the smoke
I'm comin' crazy, baby, baby, one thing that you should know
Lil' baby bounce back, yeah, act like you a stranger, yeah
Memory loss, I play like that, call your boys, I'm gang 'bout that
Faded off the '42, gorgeous, too, imported blue dream
Inside the roll-up, hold up, watch me go up, leave you so stuck

[Verse 3: Jhené Aiko]
I'm back and I'm better, can't name one bitch on my level
Ain't no question, I'm a legend, baby, don't ever forget it
Know you see me rollin' in this Rolls Gold, so cold, oh no
I can't fuck with lames like you no more, mm-mm
Back up on the scene
Out here actin' foolish, like I'm seventeen
I just bought a new whip, don't need gasoline
I just seen your new bitch, boosted my self-esteem

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Back up on my bullshit, back up on the scene
Done dealing with you, don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back, yeah, bitch

[Outro: Jhené Aiko]
Flex on my ex in my Model X
Flex on my ex in my Model X
Flex on my— Flex on my— (Yeah)
Flex on my— (Mm)
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back
I'm back up on my bullshit
I'm back up on the scene
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, ooh-woah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
