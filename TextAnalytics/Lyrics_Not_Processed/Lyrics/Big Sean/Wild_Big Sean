[Verse 1: Jessie J]
If I go hard, let me tell you that it's worth it
Play the right cards, I ain't afraid to work it
Brush 'em right off, when they say I don't deserve it
Hands to my heart, you keep my fire burning, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie J]
Ooh, it feels so crazy when you scream my name
Love it when you rock me over everyday
When I think about it, I could go insane
Here we are, it's beautiful, I'm blown away

[Chorus: Jessie J]
If this is a dream - won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy, we're running wild
If this is a dream - won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy, we're running wild

[Verse 2: Jessie J]
When it gets rough and the rain starts pouring
I turn up the heat 'cause the drama ain't important
Let 'em all talk talk, I'mma just ignore it
Hands to my heart, you, you keep me moving forward
Ooh, it feels so crazy when you scream my name

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
B.I.G. Sean Don
Okay
Today I woke up feeling like the Mayor
I spend about an hour looking in the mirror
As I should, as much as I've been through
It's a wonder I look this damn good
I could probably make it out any situation that you try to put me into
If I swim with the piranhas, guarantee that I'mma probably have a fish dinner
I meet a young girl with a sexy shape
Like Jessie J, we escapade
Where it's extra shade, she make me wanna give in
Not take in like collection plates
Wow, all these awards, bras, cars, wall to wall, was all a mirage
And I could lose it all tonight just to show the world I could do it twice
This my life

[Chorus: Jessie J]
If this is a dream - won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy, we're running wild
If this is a dream - won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy, we're running wild
D-D-D-D-Dizzee!

[Verse 4: Dizzee Rascal]
Rascala, double the dollar
I'm a jet-settin' bredda, more hits than a white collar
But I can't be boxed, flow tight like Bob Marley's locks
I can't be dropped, I'm at the peak and I can't be topped
I'm wilding out, I've lost the plot, I can't be stopped
Pull up in a gnarly 'Rari, barmy, what
Opposite of calmly, I bet Iâ€™ll get the party hot
I can't be blocked, 10 years plus running the game
You breddas just come in the game, but now I'm coming again
To get the people going dumb and insane
Hundred thousand people going bonkers in the mud and the rain
Women on shoulders, tops off, shouting my name
I'm all in their brain, why would I complain?
I thought I was the Boy in da Corner
But I'm in a penthouse, now your boy is a baller
I'm living

[Chorus: Jessie J]
If this is a dream - won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy, we're running wild
If this is a dream - won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy, we're running wild

[Outro: Jessie J]
Wild, wild, wild
Woah, oh
Wild, wild, wild
J-J-Jessie J
Woah, oh
Wild, wild, wild
Woah, oh
