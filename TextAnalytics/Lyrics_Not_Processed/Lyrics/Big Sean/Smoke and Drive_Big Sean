[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn my music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All black car (car), three percent tint
I can clearly see out but you can barely see in
The end and on the end, we blowing Indonesia
And I'mma let it hit til I get amnesia
I'm crazy, the haze got me hazy, I'm lazy
Tell Ben that it something about Mary and clearly (what)
I'm so outta here you can say a nigga spacey (damn)
Pocket full of papers so I'm finnin to get some papers (yeah)
Bout to inhale like I'm finnin to see Satan (what)
Bout to exhale like I'm finnin to see my savior
So get the leaves and trees the like it's autumn
Have them windows all rolled up rolled 'em and told 'em man

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn the music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

[Verse 2: Pat Piff]
Yeah, pass the la-la, we hitting high notes
Now just imagine this Mariah, that’s how high I go
My eyes closed I’m fly, nigga levitate
Spent more money on Swishers than you could ever make
Shit bro Quizno's, it's hella baked
But I’m a star, and you just a sub in the game
In the love with the haze, I'm like Method Man
You're all I need, my best songs with Mary J
Once in a blue when there's nothing to do
I'm reasonable doubt I never will quit you
You be gettin junior high, Blowin that boo boo
We smokin Lauren London, I thought you Nu-Nu

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn the music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

[Outro: Mike Posner]
