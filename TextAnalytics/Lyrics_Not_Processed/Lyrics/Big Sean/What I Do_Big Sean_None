[Big Sean:]
Okay, I'm young and rich
And this the shit man
(What what you you?)
You you is a shit stain
Me I'm connected like I switch planes
Addicted to Weed bitches and big chains
Woop, car so big I crash it if I switch lanes
Sayin you the man nigga quit playin
How you winning if I ain't switch teams
Bitch I had the same dreams since I was sixteen
Ripping life out out of the plastic
Turning everything to platinum
Got six rings do I look like Phil Jackson
Me, earl mac and a bunch of Toni Braxton's
Fill your cup to full full fullest
Tone if they acting up then pu-pu-pull it
High off money we the p-p-pussy
I don't st-st-st-stutter
Go g-g-girl do it right now

[Chorus:]
This ain't nothing new to me
Addicted to the cars and jewelry
All the bad bitches like whoa it's he
Swear you know you know you know you know what I do
To me, do to me, do to me, do do
To me, do to me, do to me, do do
You know what I do
