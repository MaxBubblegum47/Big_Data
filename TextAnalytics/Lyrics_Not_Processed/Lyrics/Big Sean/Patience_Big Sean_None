[Intro: Joyce Meyer]
"Patience is not simply the ability to wait
It's how we behave while we're waiting."

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Patience
Patience is the ability to accept trouble, suffering, delay
Without getting angry or upset
I feel like if you could master patience, you could master anything
To sit and plan out your goals & dreams, strategize
Understand how the universe works
How things manifest
The time it takes is part of your own learning process
It's hard to realize this when things aren't coming fast enough
Whether it's a check, a job, a loan, a dream, a goal -
It all takes patience

[Interlude]
I'm so happy dog, no matter what, no matter what's going on [Yeah]
To be in L.A., to look out that window and see that view

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Always remember, with the proper attention, from the highest place
The purest place, the highest vibration, you'll always get what you want
There's no point in rushing
If you rush too much, you might not get where you going
Usually when you rushing, you stressing
It can effect the quality of any and everything you doing
You might have a thousand strikes before you hit a homerun
To see the bottom means that the top is just as real
And just as obtainable
I realize patience is key for happiness
It allows you to be happier
To always see the bigger picture in everything
I feel like wisdom is priceless
And patience is a major part of that
There are certain things you can control
Some you can't
When you approach a situation with patience
You bring your best self to that situation
Giving yourself the best chance at success
At whatever is at hand
I learn there are lessons in patience
It could teach us a lot of things
I could give you a hundred stories
About how I wish I could go back in time to talk to myself -
Tell me to calm down, relax, don't let this throw you off
When I graduated highschool I decided to focus on music
It was one of the hardest things to watch all my homies at school
Especially the schools I could have went to
I felt like everyone around me was progressing
And I was at a standstill
Man I was doing a lot of reading
I realize you have to recognize your own process
And it can't be measured by anything but happiness
Just remember your journey is the most important part of the story
Not the trophy
The time I spent frustrated, depressed
Afraid of what might happen or not happen
Was the worst things I ever went through
Worst feelings I ever felt
I didn't get anywhere thinking, feeling like that
It was when I came out of that way of thinking that it all started turning around
I realized that a man who masters patience is a master of everything else
To make it to the top of your game
It takes patience
