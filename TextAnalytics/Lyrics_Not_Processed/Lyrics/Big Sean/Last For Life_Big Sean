Ay
I promise we gone live how we want
I promise we gone get all we want
Split the bill, naw forget the bill, look
We gon' buy the whole restaurant
Remember way back when we had said back then
We will be the ones to have arenas packed in
Livin' big time
Yup big time
To the point where my name could've been Big Ben
No matter what they gave out I never gave in
Without sunshine I never caved in
I'm Finally Famous 'til the lights is faded
Then the crowd is jaded
When I hop on stages

[Hook]
Hey
You don't live for life
So live your life
When you live and die
Look back and say you did it right
When you get it right
I hope it lasts for life

[Hook x2]
Last for life
Last for life
Last for life
Man I wish that this could last for life
(Lookin' back) Lookin' back on all we saw
Who woulda thought we'd get this far
You search your life for Heaven on Earth
When you get it right hope it lasts for life

[Verse 2]
I promise they gone all try and be me
I promise they gone know who we are
I promise we that gon' be successful
With or without the college degree
Remember old head use to tell my momma
That boy gon' be something that there I promise
So they should not expect nothin' less than to see us set like dinettes, I guess
And we all waitin' for tomorrow
Sometimes without acting you gotta deal with drama
Hey to get these dreams I figure it's gon' take more than Nyquil and pajamas
But they know what's up
We hoppin' out, and they know it's us
When we get it right
Look back and say
That we did it right
And hope it lasts for life

[Hook x2]
Last for life
Last for life
Last for life
Man I wish that this could last for life
(Lookin' back) Lookin' back on all we saw
Who woulda thought we'd get this far
You search your life for Heaven on Earth
When you get it right hope it lasts for life

[Big Sean Talking]
Yo I remember I used to ride to school with my dog Tone
And we be like listening to Kanye, Jay-Z, you know like everybody, basically
And it's crazy now cause I do business with them
You know people always ask me like you know, "Why you ain't go to school? Why you ain't go to college?"
It's like man, I didn't go to college cause...this is what I want to do, you know what I'm saying?
This is my dream
You know the thing is you can go and ask Jay-Z who Big Sean is, you can ask Pharrell who Big Sean is, you could walk into Def Jam offices right now be like "Who is Big Sean?" and LA Reid will tell you who Big Sean is
You can ask Nigo who Big Sean man, and they know
I'm 20 years old man, I done been around the world. I done been around the world. I done been around the world doing what I love to do
Like, what more could you ask, you know? And that's real
