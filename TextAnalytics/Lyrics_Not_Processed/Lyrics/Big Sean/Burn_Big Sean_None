God (Yea)
Oh God, Boi, (Yea)
G.O.O.D. (MMG, Nigga)

Chain all V.S. I ain't with the B.S
Catch me in your city riding hard through the B.X
Skinny nigga but I do it Large like a 3X
The last nigga tried to do me wrong umm he checked
Right back to that money slinging O's in the P.Jects
Or prolly catchin mileage while the pilot steer the P-Jet
Cause we next and we flex like

90PX, working all night no breaks or a recess
Vroom vroom yeah I know my car sound like a T-Rex
Bitch, I'm 23 years old and I ain't riding in a Prius
My cousin finished school can't believe he graduated
Threw him 20,000 dollars told his ass congratulations
Cause me, I wasn't made for that shit
But I could probably hire him and who all paid for his shit
And to all the hoes that was dissin' I pray to God that you see me
I'm on a yacht getting hella' high smoking good that seaweed
Bad bitch in her cha-cha grabbing on her chi-chi's
Million dollar deals on my email you mad as hell you ain't CC'ed
Chain all V.S. bitch you knows it's B.S. boy I run my city

End of story, nigga P.S
All white Maybach Greenbay they packed
Y'all niggas was slackin' 'member the hard nights we trappin'
And they say lifes a game of chess you can play checkers all on my jacket
Cause it's Damier and we bombs away on y'all big rappers
I say yeah nigga I murder that Panamera inserted back
Niggas say they want beef well where the fuck is my burger at?
I got white was serving that I been to jail I ain't going back
I alley oop your bitch off that backboard she throw it back
I slam dunk in that pussy, Blake Griffin'd yo ho, nigga
Maybach with Ricky Ross my chain rock like I know Jigga
Thats cause I do ho, shout out to my new ho
That pussy pink like Nuvo and I dog that Cujo

[Chorus]
Niggas wanna talk what they gon' say (gon' say)
I hit the pedal til that motherfucker break (til it break)
Freaky bitches love the money I make
And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn
Let that shit burn I'mma let that shit burn let that shit burn (burn, gasoline)
The roof on fire I'm only gettin' higher
50 racks all in my pocket I want bottles I'mma let that shit burn

Bitch I had one shot and I ain't blow it
Riding til the wheels fall off and they tow it
I got green on top of green damn its looking like I grow it
D-Town the hood behind me like a king cobra

Burn bitch I let it burn bitch
My money straighter than a motherfucking perm bitch
No navigation you can see it is my turn chyea (swerv, swerv)
Shorty give me all that brain still ain't never learned shit

Oh that's your girl? Damn nigga you ain't learn shit
She naked in my studio I'm on that Howard Stern shit
I swear that mac 10 is my barbell, Finally Famous the cartel
Hit your girl in my whip and now that pussy got the new car smell
Same shit different day I ain't broke no more it's a different day
Don't turn me down I got shit to say my purp strong like it's lifting weights
It's Sean Don sippin' Chandon I got a bad bitch with them pom pom's
My Rollie don't tick-tock your shit sound like a time bomb, boom, lil' bitch

[Chorus]
