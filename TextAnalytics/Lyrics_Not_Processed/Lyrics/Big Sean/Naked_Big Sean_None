[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boi, boi, wow
You know you like it with your face in the pillow
Wreck the hotel, thank god for incidentals
Rubber on tighter, no time for a kiddo
5 minutes in it, all you wearing is your nipples
Them titties, B-I-G papa
When I'm in her yaya, it turns into an opera
Screamin', she deserves a grammy
Ran through the coochie almost pulled a hammy
(B-I-G)

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
She don't know that I'mma beat it down
But I promise I'mma beat it down
Lemme touch it, lemme feel on ya
You look sexy with you heels on

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Hit that, take that
Swang that, shake that
Bring it over here
It's dried up
Take it to the crib
Be on ya

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
And it's over, yeah
When I get you naked, naked
I get you naked, naked
It's over, yeah
When I get you naked, naked
I get you naked
She want me to go down, down, down, down
She like when I go down, down, down, down
(Yes sir)

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Tell me why you acting Hollywood?
When you ain't never been to Hollywood
This is your chance to get what you been missing
Girl, I know I got what you been missing

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Hit that, take that
Swang that, shake that
Bring it over here
It's dried up
Take it to the crib
Be on ya

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
And it's over, yeah
When I get you naked, naked
I get you naked, naked
And it's over, yeah
When I get you naked, naked
I get you naked
She want me to go down, down, down, down
She like when I go down, down, down, down

[Bridge: Kevin McCall]
Cuff a million ways to make your body feel good
And baby you can have whatever you like, like, like
And you know I'mma put it down
So let me put it down

[Verse 4: Kevin McCall]
Came in, came in with 10 goons
And left with 10 models
Woke up in the bedroom
Full of empty Ciroc bottles
Fucked her on a rack
I'm throwin' the state lotto
Everywhere I go it's showtime at the Apollo
I bet you I get you naked
Bet I'd have your birthday suit
Like "Happy Belated"
I'm tryna get you in the new
So if you want the bill, I'll give you the list

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
And it's over, yeah
When I get you naked, naked
I get you naked, naked
And it's over, yeah
When i get you naked, naked
I get you naked, naked
And its over, when I
When I get you naked, naked
I get you naked, naked
And it's over, when I get you
When I get you naked, naked
I get you naked, naked
It's going down, down, down, down
When I get you naked, naked
I get you naked, naked
It's going down, down, down, down
When I get you naked, naked
I get you naked, naked
