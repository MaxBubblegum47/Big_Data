[Spoken Word: Stevie Wonder]
Hey, this is Stevie
I was blessed to be raised in the west side of Detroit
I lived on Breckenridge, that was the first home that we lived in
My neighborhood, where I was raised up
When the girls came around, I would sing
On the front porch, beating on the stairs and singing
For hours and hours upon hours
Seeing a piano for the first time
But the amazing thing as well is
Through those experiences, I was able to understand how
My being blind because my mother allowed me to be free
Didn't mean that I had to be blind to the world
I may have had a visual disability
But did not stop my vision inside me
I didn't know what it was like being poor
Because God had made me rich
Even before I was born
Rich with the spirit of knowing that
Anything you imagine that's for the good is possible to be a reality
Because a few weeks before I was discovered, I-
I had a dream that I heard my music, my record on the radio
I had nothing out, no one knew who I was, and, um
Amazing, it really happened
And so you know, it's just, it's...
I- I- I can say to other young people as I said to my son Kailand
I said, "Listen, what you don't understand
Is that God gave you a brand even before you were born
All you had to do in life is walk into it."
