Eh everywhere we go, we know, are ya'll ready for this?

[Verse 1]

Man we going Harlem, Trot around the Globe and go
Places that you ain't know
You would go would that you could go
I be the man if you ever should go
Pull up to the party in my bestest clothes, then pose for the ho's
You know the hoes from the tv shows that we all know, yup she goin go (bitch)
Good life nigga so we only pop mo, mo
Man toast to the rose
Rozay rose even hop up in the Royce
I'd be god damn if I ever go broke
I made it out the hood, didn't have to deal dope
But a nigga that fire, you could prolly smell smoke (Damn)
And I'm on the block like defense, leading, never leaving, for a reason
Believe it

[Hook]

Everywhere we go, we know
Show up, they goin know us (x4)
Everywhere we go we, know

[Verse 2]

So now you a rapper, huh?
Your crew spent all day trappin, huh?
You and your niggas all smell like Vagisil
When I was in the hood like Castrol
Not by choice, more like force
Difference between me and you, you dreamed about a Porsche
I was in the crib scheming how to lease that Porsche (Jeesh)
I spit disease with no worts
Its a shame what you pay to see, It's cool you goin to pay for me
I never let this greedy world take from me
I ain't sleep but my dreams stay awake for me
See we do everything we dreamed we would
Hey say I can't, I say I could, man I should
Send these rappers to their death row like Suge

[Hook]
