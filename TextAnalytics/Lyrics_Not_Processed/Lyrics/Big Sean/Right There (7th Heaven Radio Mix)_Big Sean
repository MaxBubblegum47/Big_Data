[Refrain: Ariana Grande + (Big Sean)]
You got it, you got it, babe (Ya see it?)
You got it, you got it, babe (Got it, huh?)
You got it, you got it, babe (Sean Don)
You got it, you got it, babe

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, baby

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande]
And I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy, you’re on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in in your eyes and I lose all track of time

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Verse 4: Big Sean + Ariana Grande]
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation, would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don’t mind a drive-thru
That’s why I got you
And I’ll never let you go, I got you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change (I’m never gonna change)
I’m always gonna stay (I’m always gonna stay)
You call for me, I’m right there (I'm right there)
Right there (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there
