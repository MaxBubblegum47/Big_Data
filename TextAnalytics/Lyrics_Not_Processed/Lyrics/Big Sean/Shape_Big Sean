[Intro]
Let me see your shape
Let me see your shape
Let me see your shape
Let me see your shape
Be the baddest chick in the universe
She gon do whatever it takes
Be the baddest chick in the universe
She gon do whatever it takes

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Let me see your shape, let me see your shape
I knew you was the one before I even saw your face
I’m a hero in my ends and I ain’t never wore no cape
I be putting on them pounds but I ain’t gaining no weight
Let me see your shape, girl, you’re doing great
Her lips around my (uh), said she’d only do it for Drake
If you play your cards right you can sip on some of this ace
If you play your cards right you can sip on some of this ace
I got plenty more on my table, CEO of my label
I get Arab money on Jewish bread, bitch we be making that bagel
No cameras on my table ’cause the consequence could be fatal
We got all your girlfriends in and now they’re acting grateful
She asking me for that cane, I said I won’t be able
She went to use the toilet and now she sounding nasal
Before my momma had me said she saw the angel Gabriel
Before my momma had me said she saw the angel Gabriel

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I'm with like 4-5 bad bitches, what a compilation
Hennessey, me, weed, what a combination
I done had a bad day, tonight's a compensation
Nothing more important in the world than world domination
Gon' lick it up, cash flow picking up
Still ain’t got no patience, baby, quick ain’t never quick enough
It seems like rich ain’t never rich enough, bitch I’m so nasty
I’mma probably be 70 years old, happy I can still get it up
Drive it on me like surprise, ooh, almost had me a stroke
Poppin champagne so I’m sober, 
her tongue out, she gross, love it
I’m OG connected though, presidential suite, presidential weed, respect my vote
Me and Tinie Tempah doing numbers, we projected ho
These niggas talking shit, it really don’t affect us though
I spent all my money on my outfit
, do that mean that I’m shallow?
I’ll take a bad bitch and skedaddle
And she even showed me her tattoo when I said

[Hook]
