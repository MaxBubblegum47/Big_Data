[Intro:]
I don't care what they say
What they say

[Verse 1:]
Hello, bad bitch!
Hello, hello, bad bitch!
Tell my niggas on earth about that mellow swag shit
Ohh yeah you cocky huh
But I bet you can't take it in like a rocket but
Trying to get it in, get it in, get it in
Will I let my stick hit it miss hockey puck?
I'm mellow though, get hella dome
I even got a big girl call that bitch my telabone?
Bitch blowing, can't see my shit, got that Helen Keller dome
You ever been to this space museum?
Well, my dick just like that telescope
Whoo, damn, whoo, damn!
That pussy from my wish list I stop calling them kitty
Cause them cats be on that fish shit
Ughh, she said she'll hear the tune because it's perfect
She a mini man, taking shots like Curry bitch

[Chorus:]
Bad bitches raise your cup
Taking your girl I dont give a fuck
I don't care what they say
What they say
What they say
What they say
Everybody leave your man tonight
I swear you'll be glad that I took you out
Everybody leave your man tonight
And when I'm done you can tell where she'll be tonight
Everyboy leave your mean tonight

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Sean Don, Bitch
Nigga, fuck your bitch, nigga!
Okay I make her call me B-I
Bitch I'm on my B-I
All my bottles they be knee high
I'm rub g's down, I put g down
I'm fresh out that fucking limo
And im everything but sober
Break, break, breaking that tree and backing it up like it's October!
Woah! I walk in this bitch with a grip in my hand
I tell her I'm me, she jizz in her pants
She's shaking her it around and around
Her coochie a club my stick is
I found 20,000 she just found my dick
Haha, so I guess we both just hit a lick!
I tell her w-w-welcome, welcome to the good life!
Heard you had a bad day, well, let's make it good night!
If they say we ain't big
We'll turn this to a should night
Let's swim in alcohol and hop up on our red kush fly
I'm Mr. Big, bitch! Yeah!

[Chorus:]
Bad bitches, raise your cup
Taking your girl I dont give a fuck
I don't care what they say
What they say!
What they say!
What they say!
Everybody leave your man tonight
I swear you'll be glad that I took you out
And when I'm done you gonna tell where she'll be tonight
Everybody leave your man tonight

[Verse 3:]
Bro, why your girl up on me like I'm John Doe
Hanging out back stage, waiting for a photo
Oh you dance but yous a gogo but she look nice to meet you
No you dude fucking up he can't handle your model features
On a scale of 1 through 9, sorry shorty but you's a dime
No your man lost and I'm not hesitate to make you mine
I'm 'bout to snatch you up look a fool mark it, time to bag her up
Because I only got one night, and so we acting up
Girls get drunk bring them up, some much sluts so much fun
So I keep on going cause I can't get enough!
Little momma where you goin so much paper to be made
So much rhyme until we talk [?]
My girl prefer to give me brains
I must say, I must say, [?]
Yeah girl you man from it, fire flame, fire flame
Fuck with us....[?]
New Boyz

[Chorus:]
Bad bitches, raise your cup
Taking your girl I dont give a fuck
I don't care what they say
What they say!

What they say!
Everybody leave your man tonight
I swear you'll be glad that I took you out
And when I'm done you gonna tell where she'll be tonight
Everybody leave your man tonight
