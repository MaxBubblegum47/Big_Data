[Intro]
Yeah
This is that-
Uh huh, where the money?
Uh huh, what, what

[Hook]
My whole squad in this bitch
And they gon' stay there the whole night
I mix that shit with champagne
Been waitin' on that shit my whole life
Forever me and my dawgs
Yeah, nigga, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know right
My whole squad in this bitch
And they gon' stay there the whole night
I mix that shit with champagne
Been waitin' on that shit my whole life
Forever me and my dawgs
Yeah, nigga, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know right

[Refrain: Big Sean + Kanye West]
And they always stay down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
This for my dawgs, for my dawgs, man, that always stay
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Weed, money, liquor
I'mma drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown

[Verse 1]
Okay, I ain't that fucked up, but I'm halfway
We came a long way from the alley
Bad, bad, bad bitches they dressed up
Like it's the NBA draft day
And I bet and I bet that she ain't gon' be that late
For a young, sexy face like me
A young, young, young, sexy face like me
She like girls if she don't like me
And if you do then I do girl, I see ya, I see ya
The way that you pose I might have to IG ya
Sexy young thing, I might have to ID her
Ooh, damn I got some ideas
We could fuck up the couch in the club like it came from Ikea
Goin' so hard the whole night is a blur
Older women be like, "damn, you mature"
I say you the one, but goddamn I got nerve

[Hook]
My whole squad in this bitch
And they gon' stay there the whole night
I mix that shit with champagne
Been waitin' on that shit my whole life
Forever me and my dawgs
Yeah, nigga, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know

[Refrain: Big Sean + Kanye West]
And they always stay down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
This for my dawgs, for my dawgs, man, that always stay
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Weed, money, liquor
I'mma drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown

[Verse 2]
Okay, I sip the kamikaze while I bend the body
And I whip the Maserati like I'm Ricky Bobby
I be mobbin', I be mobbin' like I'm Gotti
I might even speak Italian
50 women in the room like we ain't even got a lobby
I be wildin' like I never had a daddy
And the titties paparazzi, they be flashin', god damnit I'm a hottie
Got her friends tryna fuck me and her man's tryna rob me
And she won't leave me alone, I tell the trick to get a hobby
I ain't even gonna lie, I got a million dollar chick
With a billion dollar pussy
Every time I cum, I swear to God I feel like I be rich
Yeah, tryna get that hotel money
But you know them crackers ain't gonna let you get the Ritz
They ain't gonna let you get the fountain in the front with the fist
They gonna give you courtside at the Clips
But never ownership, they ainâ€™t on that donor shit
Well, fuck giving it to me, I'mma take that shit
Forget crackin' the code, I'mma break that shit
I'mma calamari steak that shit
And cop so much ice, me and my dogs gonna skate that shit
Bitch do it so big you can't escape that shit
Hoes tryna have my baby just to Ricki Lake that shit
I hate that shit
Girls handing me their heart, how could I not break that shit?

[Hook]
My whole squad in this bitch
And they gon' stay there the whole night
I mix that shit with champagne
Been waitin' on that shit my whole life
Forever me and my dawgs
Yeah, nigga, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know right

[Refrain: Big Sean + Kanye West]
And they always stay down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
This for my dawgs, for my dawgs, man, that always stay
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Weed, money, liquor
I'mma drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown
