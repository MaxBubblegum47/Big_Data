[Intro]
Dear Hip Hop
I thought Hip-Hop was supposed to be a means of poetically expressing yourself
But it seems these days you'd say anything to get your CD's off the shelf
Hard times I am still compelled to move
But I swear to you it's that old school groove that's playing above the lyrics
Because if the music wasn't there, I definitely wouldn't hear it

[Bridge: Royce Da 5’9]
Right off the rip, nobody could fuck with me
I'm out of space, mind and body, my soul and so on, so on
Mami, I'm fly is an understatement, come to greatness

[Hook: Mr. Porter]
I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gonna do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
Right off the rip, nobody is quite like me
You gonna need a NASA spacecraft to sight me
If you don't like me, bite me, I could give a fuck less; fighting excites me
Leaning on the moon with a patron fifth, playing my own shit
And I sound terrific, I'm not cocky, I'm beyond that
It's time to start another hobby, I'm beyond rap
Run and tell your baby daddy 
and your son Ray
I'm hot, I sunbathe on the sun babe,
 I'm the one on the one way
Hands and pretty long legs from the runway, 
my nigga Nauny is a genius
You gonna need a ladder just to climb on my penis
Got two words for the rap game: fuck y'all

[Hook: Mr. Porter]
I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gonna do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Right off the rip, you thought it was a wrap for me, didn't you?
Go ahead and admit it hater, cold as ice, I'm a living refrigerator
The reason hip-hop's breathing the defibrillator
I did a bid just for drunk driving, it'll never happen again
‘Cause now I'm drunk flying, I'm an innovator
When I say I'm on Venus, I don't mean that I'm dating the tennis player
I'm on Saturn where you don't matter, alone
I'm past the zone where your phone scatters
Hello? Can you hear me now you? You don't got a fucking choice
Elbowed my way into everybody's conversations
With rhyming, timing and patience, now I'm in space bitch
I used to have to be on some watch what I say shit but now you gotta take it

[Hook: Mr. Porter]
I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gonna do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Right off the rip, the respect is demanded
Sitting on y’all so you can’t understand it
I back a bitch down like a nigga chiropractic
Back in this bitch like I’m putting on a jacket
Mission Impossible, fulfilling all my tactics
Boi! Until I’m filling up a casket
You know, I think I'll have the soufflé
Mister Big Shot, Russian Roulette
My neck look like water boy, where is Bobby Boucher?
Bitches jump for me and I am not the bouquet
I used to ride up in a put-put
Now I rolls in the green, Tiger Wood putt putts
Your girl used to be my butt slut, fuck my truck up
‘Cause I’m fucking Tiger sluts, yup so hold your girl close
And scream B-I-G like she recognize a ghost, fuck with me

[Hook: Mr. Porter]
I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gonna do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good
