[Refrain 1]
Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD
Selling D, feeling like the 70s
Getting paid like we seventy

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Float around my town like it's the motherfucking seven seas
Hit the club, lose seven Gs, film it all on 7D's
Spilling liquor rest in peace, rest of my G's rest with a piece
Start the day dissecting weed, then strategize then rest my team
Same show, different seats, same game, different league
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Bitch

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I was thinking about the ice that I put on, money that I've blown
Bitches that I know, everything that I've done wrong
All the licks I hit, all the bullets missed
Got my shit legit, a lot of people pissed, well
I got money coming through
Drugs and women coming too
Got my family living comfortable
Got me thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do

[Refrain 2]
Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD
Selling D, feeling like the 70s
Getting paid like we seventy
Use to roll around in that Toyota rolling seven deep, damn

[Outro: Big Sean]
Bitch
