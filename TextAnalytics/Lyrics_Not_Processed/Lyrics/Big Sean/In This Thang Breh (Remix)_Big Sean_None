[Verse 2: Big Sean]

B-I B-I-G Tell a bitch bow (wow)
Smack a ho bitch, get sue then﻿ I skip trial (wow)
She wet when nothing wet ain't still?
Gave her a milk mustache and ain't got milk (ew)
Shinin like prime time, my hood niggas always think its crime time
Ask her if she got a man and its lyin time
I told my money and my bitch that’s its grind time (yup)
Me and E-4 smokin C4 Throwin green like we Tebow
Still yelling fucking C-O, he know, show up at the people, wanna he go
Turn a Hero, when I meet lo (yup)
And that's real Detroit, if you talk shit we real destroy
West-Side rider, I'm a real D-boy
Niggas looking like real decow's, Lil Bitch!!
