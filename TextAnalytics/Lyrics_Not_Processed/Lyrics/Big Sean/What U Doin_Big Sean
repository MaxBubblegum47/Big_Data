And me and Sean came to party, so it's TNA

[Interlude: DJ Drama & Big Sean]
Hold up CB
Now Chris came to me and said, "Drama, let's do In My Zone 2"
I said, "The heck, man? Work the album though, what you doin'?"
He said, "All this, we just bullshittin', man"
You know why?
We in our zone, baby

Uh-oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, Big Sean & Both]
Nigga, why you mad? (Uh) You know we bullshittin' (Uh)
I like my cars how I like my broads, top missin' (Uh)
Made full of liquor and faces full of DNA (Yup)
And me and Sean came to party, so it's TNA
I go to war for that money, I'm a Green Beret (Uh)
I got that cash flow, nigga, I just need to save (Uh)

'Cause by the time you see me
Been seein' your girl like hella times (Yup)
And she might say your name but she yellin' mine
You a sucker, you a lame, I'm a veteran, ha

Nigga, hold up, the track done blowed up
My flow sick as shit, I think I throwed up

And we responsible for after the show, all these babies
You know it's G.O.O.D. music, CBE I do do it
Poo poo on that track and I be shittin' on them, vomit fluid
Call a coroner, nigga, good riddance
