[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Under the sun, there is a remedy
Under the sun, for every evil
Under the sun, there is a remedy
Under the sun, for every evil
We The Best Music

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott & 
DJ Khaled
]
All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah
If I ever, I move onto better things
I just copped a mansion for my son on everything, yeah
(DJ Khaled)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah
'Cause if I ever, I move onto better things
That's on my life, yeah yeah
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah yeah
Matchin' condo, matchin' Rollie
That's on everything (Straight up)
That's on my life, yeah yeah

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Ayy, DJ Khaled, I'd die for you, my nigga
So you already know I'd kill for you, boss (

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Diamonds drippin' on me, she know who the one
Two-seaters every season and I just begun
Aquafina, she drippin' puddles on a sunny day
Multi-million dollar plays and that's a hundred ways
Fuck a fashion, we could match in my Herm√®s seats
Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached
Say no names, Supreme underwear and like 80 chains
Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change
Petty bitches postin' niggas like they was wedding pictures
Evidently, I'm gettin' richer, trickin' seven figures
Ain't no difference when you see me or that's on television
Chasin' a hundred million, baby, my natural ambition, boss

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah
If I ever, I move onto better things
I just copped a mansion for my son on everything, yeah
All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah
'Cause if I ever, I move onto better things
That's on my life, yeah yeah
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah yeah
Matchin' condo, matchin' Rollie
That's on everything (Straight up)
That's on my life, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Boy, I took my life and bossed it up
I took the risk, coin-tossed it up
I just left work to work some more, I'm still a workaholic
I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs
Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false
I walk up to my fate and stare that shit in the face
Hungry for the competition, bitch, get on my plate
No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list
There's no room off in the schedule
It's only room for improvement
And I realized all I ever needed was in me, nigga
S on my chest, boy, so shots can't even pinch me, nigga
No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me, nigga
God is in me, that's the only one who can end me, nigga
And we seen more blessings than a Baptist Ebenezer
My daddy says, "You got a good girl, she's a keeper"
Boy, I'm a Caesar, I see shit and seize it
Roc-A-Fella chain, but you can still get Ether'd
Yeah, they don't really fuckin' feel me
Man, but when you really run it they try and clip your Achilles'
I'm on track to a billi', I got Khaled fuckin' with me
That mean I got the Holy Key and got the key to the city, lil nigga

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah
If I ever, I move onto better things
I just copped a mansion for my son on everything, yeah
All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah
'Cause if I ever, I move onto better things
That's on my life, yeah yeah
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah yeah
Matchin' condo, matchin' Rollie
That's on everything (Straight up)
That's on my life, yeah, yeah
