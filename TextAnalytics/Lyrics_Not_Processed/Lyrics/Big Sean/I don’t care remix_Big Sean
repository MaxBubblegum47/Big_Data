Haha, so I guess we both just hit a lick!
I tell her w-w-welcome, welcome to the good life!
Heard you had a bad day, well, let's make it good night!

Let's swim in alcohol and hop up on our red kush fly

(hyper payne)
Feelin her rise like the lift in a tower
I'm suckin her sweet, and she blowin my sour
Now we in the shower, waterin her flower
Love you in a minute but fuck you in a hour
Shawty so hot and I'm blowin her candle
Open her door, cause I know how to handle
Her and her friend, you auto I'm manual
Light up the jackson like fuck it I'm samuel'
Way that she rolls it, you'd think that its dubz
Ass going round like a chandalear in a club
Tell on the dj that we turn it up
Red like a sign but we never stop
Yellin on whoa, im breakin her door
They screamin they really need it some more
Taking this flow, cause I'm rock the show
Girl shake it fast, and please don't slow
The way she dancing I thing she's a pro
Round and round, she dropping it low
I think she's a stripper or maybe a hoe
She know the game, I'm keepin the score
Girl work it our like you doing my chore
And i'll pay more, if you do it some more
Bae you fly, can we take of away
Some where tonight , and spend on a day
Wooo. woooo

And when I'm done you gonna tell where she'll be tonight
