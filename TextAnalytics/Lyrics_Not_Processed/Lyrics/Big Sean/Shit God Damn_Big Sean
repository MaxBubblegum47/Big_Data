[Chorus: Chris Brown & Big Sean]
I got 'em like shit, goddamn
And the club's jumpin', let the party begin
I got 'em like (Oh) shit, goddamn
V.I.P., that's our section (DJ Babey Drew)
I got 'em like shit, goddamn
And shawty, you can bring all your friends (Boing, boing. boing)
We got 'em like (I do it), shit, goddamn
We got 'em like (I do it), shit, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Big Sean]
Got the chauffeur just to open the doors (What? What?)
I'm fly (Haha, I'm fly), and I know it (I know it), oh-whoa (Her too)
You make me yodel-le-he-hoo
'Cause you bad, yes, I know it (Boing, boing, boing, boing)
Girl, you got that fire, need to break me off
Get closer to my bed, then you take it off
And I'm the flyest nigga in here, knock it off (Oh-oh)
See me and Sean came for the ladies (Came for the ladies)
It's about to get crazy (It's about to get crazy), in here
And there's a line around the block
All the single ladies, you'll be taken by me

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Big Sean]
I got 'em like shit, goddamn
And the club's jumpin', let the party begin
I got 'em like (Oh) shit, goddamn, goddamn

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Now I got a hundred thousand dollars and girls (What? What?)
Both legal (Haha)
Patr√≥n chillin' on rocks like the bald eagle (I do it)
Ooh, it's about to get drastic (Yeah)
Ass is like the number one draft pick (Boing)
I does this shit historically
No wonder why they recorded me (Boing, boing)
I'm important as these imported drinks that they p-pour for me (Boing, boing, ha)
Your wifey is a whore to me
I break her, break her off then send her back like she got a warranty (I do it)
Bust it open, girl, let me see somethin' (Somethin')
Her and her friend ask what time it is, 3-somethin', duh (Duh)
It's just me and C Breezy (Breezy)
Life's a bitch 'cause a ho is too easy
I'm blowin' oh-oh-oh-oh
Smokin' loudly, boy
Just blew four Os, I'm outty, boy
I got this shit so cloudy, boy (Look)
All these hoes up in my truck, that shit look like a lobby, boy (Boing, boing, boing)
But you don't, you don't, you don't know nothing 'bout that, boy

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Big Sean]
I got 'em like shit, goddamn (Haha, do ya?)
And the club's jumpin', let the party begin
I got 'em like (Oh) shit, goddamn, goddamn
V.I.P., that's our section (Woo)
I got 'em like shit, goddamn
And shawty, you can bring all your friends (Boing, boing, boing)
We got 'em like (I do it), shit, goddamn
We got 'em like (I do it, oh), shit, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn

[Outro: DJ Drama]
