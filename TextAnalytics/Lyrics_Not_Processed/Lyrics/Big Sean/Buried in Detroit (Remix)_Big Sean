[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I’m a writer and a lover
I’m a Midwest music man
And I’ve been to a lot of places
But I’m gon’ end where I began
I took class in Carolina
Got high smoking joints
And now they know my name in Paris

[Hook: Mike Posner]
But I’ll be buried in Detroit
Next to my father, and my father’s father, too
I used to live in New York City
But, baby, that ain’t no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I’ve made love in every city
But I’ll be buried in Detroit

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
I don’t claim to be a prophet, I just speak my mind
I try to tell it like it is and sometimes God makes it rhyme
I like my songs how I like my women
Honest and to the point
You see I got fucked up in Stockholm

[Hook: Mike Posner]
But I’ll be buried in Detroit
Next to my father, and my father’s father, too
I used to live in New York City
But, baby, that ain’t no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I’ve made love in every city
But I’ll be buried in Detroit

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Man, I always kept it righteous knowing it would come back to me
Even when my hunger was outweighing the strategy
And now I pray to God like I hope you a map for me
Up at 5 am like nobody want it as bad as me
I guess hunger either kill you or it energize you
Motor city, boy, I been a driver
The young Detroit legend, I swear I got the city inspired
And bought Em out, too, just to solidify it
D-boy, d-boy, that's how I was raised
Boss up and put the city on, forever my ways
Me and ma started a charity to give the kids clarity
And take it further than the foundation we laid
Thanksgiving Day parade, I got carried through the city
And after that, I hope I get married in the city
And after that, I hope I get buried in the city
Even when I'm gone, you still gon' hear me through the city

[Outro: Mike Posner]
Buried in Detroit
Whoa ho, whoa ho
Buried in Detroit
Whoa ho, whoa ho
Buried in Detroit
