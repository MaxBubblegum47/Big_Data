[Big Sean - Verse 1]
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit
So go head and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life'd it!
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael hoe
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it's because I got the title hoe
See I just want my fantasies and real life
You got everything to me what it feel like
Muthaf-ck the radio if I can't hear mine
They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I'mma make it, but even if I don't
Don't feel bad cuz honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Chorus]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cuz in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

[Big Sean - Verse 2]
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
Thats what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set before you considered great
How many missed calls before you considered fake
How many dreams before its considered fate
I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cuz they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory"
I'm praying that he make, wished we could go back
Cuz honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories...

[Chorus]
