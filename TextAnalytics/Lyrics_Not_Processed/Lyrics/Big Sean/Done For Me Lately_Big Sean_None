[Intro: Big Sean]
You know I— (
Woah
)
You know I— (
Woah
)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
You know I made some extra calls for you
I bring the flowers to the door for you
You know I take that extra trash out
I bought that ticket then I cashed out
I took you on a vacation
Lame shit, man, I'm just saying shit

[Chorus]
What have you done for me baby?
What have you done for me lately-ah?
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately-ah?
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately?

[Pre Chorus: Big Sean]
Damn, where your extra texts and the extra call?
And I double time it up and I know you want
And I know you wanna shimmy too

[?] three me do we do 'member?
You know I give up on my me-time for your free time in between time
I'm taking extra trips on the way to Elon
I'm going on camera, to be mine

[Chorus: Big Sean]
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately-ah?
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately? (Bring me out)
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately-ah?
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately?

[Verse 2: Belly]
I turn a ballerina, to a stripper
Gotta kill them hoes now, like the ripper
I'm on the low, we on the liquor
When she leave, I swear I feel her in my liver (In my liver)
She got that type of pussy make your body shiver (Body shiver)
She got that [?] I wonder if she got a sister (Oh, my God)
I got her, drip, dripping like a fisher
Pull out my dick so she can she the bigger picture

[Interlude: Belly]
I kill her pussy, that's a cold case
I get the bottles by the cold case
Top [?] in the office
I got a pocket full of old faces

[Chorus: Big Sean]
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately-ah?
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately? (Bring me out)
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately-ah?
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately?

[Interlude: Belly]
I kill her pussy, that's a cold case (Cold case)
I get the bottles by the cold case (Cold case)
I kill her pussy, that's a cold case (Cold case)
I get the bottles by the cold case (Cold case)

[Bridge: Belly]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Pre Chorus: Big Sean]
Damn, where your extra texts and the extra call?
And I double time it up and I know you want
And I know you wanna shimmy too

[?] three me do we do 'member?
You know I give up on my me-time for your free time in between time
I'm taking extra trips on the way to Elon
I'm going on camera, to be mine

[Chorus: Big Sean]
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately-ah?
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately? (Bring me out)
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately-ah?
What have you done for me lately?
What have you done for me lately?
