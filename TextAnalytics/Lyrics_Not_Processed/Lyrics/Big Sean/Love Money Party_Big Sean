[Intro:]
Mike Will Made-It

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Money ain't nothing but money
When you get to the money, it ain't nothing but money
Love ain't nothing but love
When you learn how to love, it ain't nothing but love
Party ain't nothing but a party
When you party every day, it ain't nothing but a party
Love, money, party
Love, money, party
Love, money, party
Love, money, party
We want love, money, party

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
If I can't trust, then why am I giving my heart in exchange for him to love me?
'Cause there ain't much
Difference than a one night stand and one that ain't for me
Is it too much?
'Cause you hate that you love everything that he do and you can't deny you wanna
So what?
My heart'll light a fire in this bitch and blow it

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Money ain't nothing
Money can't buy you love, I don't give a damn if you sitting on a trill
Money ain't nothing
After that, run out
What about the real and the way you feel?
Money get low and the DJ stop
And the music slow down and that shit get blurry
Love, money, party, yeah

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Money ain't nothing but money
When you get to the money, it ain't nothing but money
Love ain't nothing but love
When you learn how to love, it ain't nothing but love
Party ain't nothing but a party
When you party every day, it ain't nothing but a party
Love, money, party
Love, money, party
Love, money, party
Love, money, party
We want love, money, party

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
I've been through heartbreaks, heartbreaks
Much more than anybody with a human heart can take
You know it's something not too good to elaborate
But I been left in the lobby
I done been through the fire, I done been the girl on the side
I done laid it all on the line
And now they growing up
And I bet you regret it 'cause it just don't taste like mine

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Money ain't nothing
Money can't buy you love, I don't give a damn if you sitting on a trill
Money ain't nothing
After that, run out
What about the real and the way you feel?
Money get low and the DJ stop
And the music slow down and that shit get blurry
Love, money, party, yeah

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Money ain't nothing but money
When you get to the money, it ain't nothing but money
Love ain't nothing but love
When you learn how to love, it ain't nothing but love
Party ain't nothing but a party
When you party every day, it ain't nothing but a party
Love, money, party
Love, money, party
Love, money, party (God, oh)
Love, money, party (yup)
We want love, money, party

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay I walk in, sorta late

They both got that gorgeous face
They both shine, they both mine
Getting green, 'cause it's go time

Yeah, I'm chilling with those kind

In the morning, I don't even need a carry on, what

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Money ain't nothing but money
