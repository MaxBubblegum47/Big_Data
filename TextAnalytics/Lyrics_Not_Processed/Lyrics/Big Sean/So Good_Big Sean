[Intro: Big Sean & Kodak Black]
Yeah, yeah, Metro on the beat, Metro on the beat
Ayy, Lil' Metro on that beat

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Head so good, pussy so good
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Yeah, I would, yeah, I would
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Head so good, pussy so good
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Yeah, I would, yeah, I would
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'ma splash, I'ma splash, pop a pill, I won't even do the half
Do the whole thing, I'ma last, I'ma last
Pussy so good, I never fuck you in the ass
Got a long dick, that shit barely fit
Like O.J. glove, you must acquit
All these other hoes, I must had quit
When you ask me, "What other bitch you fuckin' with?"
I grab you up on some hood shit, you look back like, "Good shit"
Got so deep in that bitch, it felt spiritual
Flooded in that pussy, it's a miracle
Yeah, how the hell you sucked the soul out my dick?
Then made me a feast and started rollin' up the zip
See, that's the shit I'm talkin' 'bout, that's why I fuck with you
I had told all my niggas, they want fuck you too
Got mad, told my niggas they can't fuck with you
'Cause last time we fucked, I fell in love with you
I know my face the perfect tat
You lil' baby, I'm the dad, tryna fuck so bad 'cause that

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Head so good, pussy so good
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Yeah, I would, yeah, I would
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Head so good, pussy so good
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Yeah, I would, yeah, I would
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would

[Verse 2: Kash Doll]
Head so good, dick is so good
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit I would
Yeah, I would, yeah, I would
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit I would
You can smash, you can smash
Hood nigga, you don't even need a pass
But do you think you up for the task?
'Cause this a big body Benz, please don't crash
Last time I let you fuck, it was amazin', shit
Love a nigga who ain't scared to put his face in it
And I still remember every single place you licked
So I sucked the soul outcha just to thank that dick
I'm a nasty bitch, I can take that shit
Pussy tight as long johns, I'ma make that fit
And I never tell a chick about the pipe I get
'Cause if she ever disrespect, I have to fight that bitch
You know that beef stick so bomb
My nigga ask who pussy is it, I said, "Big Sean"
Tryna make me fall in love, nigga, don't play
If I could quit my job, then I lay up and fuck you all day

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Head so good, pussy so good
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Yeah, I would, yeah, I would
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Head so good, pussy so good
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Yeah, I would, yeah, I would
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
You got such a pretty mind (Oh, my God)
I be damned if I didn't sixty-nine
I can hit this shit until I'm sixty-nine
Nah, fuck it, I can hit this shit until I'm six feet down
Deep in that dirt (Dirt), what you gotta snooker just to leave in that skirt? (Skirt)
Got everybody watchin' while you leavin' from work (Work)
Got the preacher watchin' while you leavin' from church
Baby, you know what you worth
I'm the only one that know what to do when you take that ass out
Sit it on my lap, that shit make me wanna cash out
Cum inside your face, aw, baby, now you can't smile
Cum inside that pussy, I'ma give your mom a grandchild
I'ma make you cum three times
Four times, five times, baby, six times (Damn)
I'ma ask you, "Is this pussy mine?" (Is it mine?)
If you say no, bitch, you lyin' (Bitch, you lyin')
'Cause when I take it out, you start cryin' (Start cryin')
I'd done fucked around and realigned your spine (Goddamn)
You look good from the front and the back
You lil' baby, I'm the dad, tryna fuck so bad, 'cause that

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Head so good, pussy so good
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Yeah, I would, yeah, I would
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Head so good, pussy so good
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would
Yeah, I would, yeah, I would
If I could quit my job and fuck you all day, shit, I would

[Outro: Big Sean]
Oh God, oh my God
