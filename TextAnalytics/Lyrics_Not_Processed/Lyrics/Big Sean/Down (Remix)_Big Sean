[Verse 1: Samantha Gongol]
Didn't even really wanna go
But if you get me out, you get a show
There's so many bodies on the floor
So baby we should go and add some more
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Everywhere I look are peoples' hands
Thrown up in the air to help them dance
Come on, baby, catch me if you can
I know you don't have any other plans
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?

[Hook]
Are you... down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-d-d-down, are you Down, are you down, are you d-d-down, are you?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, down, d-d-d-down?

[Verse  2: Big Sean]
Are you? (Woah, Yeah, Yeah)
Are you?
4am text, I reply everytime
Tryin to get it in like I'm finna' miss the deadline
Look we if connect time and we connect minds
And you tell me what I need to hear to reset mine
And I make you feel a way down to the electron
I get you there quicker than the pre-check line
Let's find time for lost times
You lose your cellphone, I toss mine
Give it time, let it breathe
Good guy, but for you I do the felonies
And if you never test me, I never cheat
I got enough faith to be faithful to you
And if you not around I still save it for you
I'm sitting thinking if you thinking bout  me thinking of you (Damn)
I fuck you to sleep and come in your dreams
You wake up, I'm the first thing you see
Don
