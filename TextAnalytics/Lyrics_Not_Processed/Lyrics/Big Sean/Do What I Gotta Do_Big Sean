[Intro: Big Sean]
Lil bitch (money!)
And I need to see that ass everywhere (money!)
Yup, I've done worked too hard
Finally Famous in this

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Baby, do what you got to do, do what you got to do
Do what you got to do, baby do what you got to do
For the shit that you gotta have, shit that you gotta have
Do what you gotta do for the shit that you gotta have
We out here!
Grinding, shining
If I ain't getting paper, bitch I'm dying
If I ain't getting paper, bitch I'm dying
Do what you got to do, what you got to do
Do what you got to do, what you got to do
Do what you got to do, what you got to do
Do what you got to do, what you got to do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Pop it, pop it, pop, pop that, whoa
Do everything except stop that
Hold up, all of that ass I can't grab it?
You might as well have be a fat bitch
Boy, I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Getting sloppy toppy while I'm rolling kamikaze
Skeet, skeet, swear I made the pussy fire hydrant
She up and down the pole like she, like she firefighting
Bitch I'm Finally Famous, I do, I do what I want
Money, money, sex, and money in the air with an aroma
Swear I got her head banging, banging, might be in a coma
Walk up to the baddest bitch and tell her that I own her

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Baby, do what you got to do, do what you got to do
Do what you got to do, baby do what you got to do
For the shit that you gotta have, shit that you gotta have
Do what you gotta do for the shit that you gotta have
We out here!
Grinding, shining
If I ain't getting paper, bitch I'm dying
If I ain't getting paper, bitch I'm dying
Do what you got to do, what you got to do
Do what you got to do, what you got to do
Do what you got to do, what you got to do
Do what you got to do, what you got to do

[Verse 2: Tyga]
T-Killa, dick game gorilla
I'm the one, pull up, like Billups
Two hoes, screw 'em like a fucking Phillips
Asian bitches, Wu-Tang, give them RZA
Oh really, Milli Vanilli, faking with me
Bet she lift that ass up high like she hit a wheelie
In the club, be in the back like a Bentley
Niggas pretending to be me, that shit don't offend me
I'm about my business and this bitch is temporary
I don't give them love, try February
Money committed, swear this shit be married
I get that cake, cake, cake, then I pop a cherry

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Baby, do what you got to do, do what you got to do
Do what you got to do, baby do what you got to do
For the shit that you gotta have, shit that you gotta have
Do what you gotta do for the shit that you gotta have
We out here!
Grinding, shining
If I ain't getting paper, bitch I'm dying
If I ain't getting paper, bitch I'm dying
Do what you got to do, what you got to do
Do what you got to do, what you got to do
Do what you got to do, what you got to do
Do what you got to do, what you got to do
