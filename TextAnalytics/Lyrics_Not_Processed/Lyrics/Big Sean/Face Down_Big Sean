I got a fire red bone who go all night long, Boosie

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She got a diamond in her pearl tongue
It shine everytime she cums
Bling bling up in this motherfucker
Make up on my sheets and on my shirt
And on my briefs, she get on my nerves
But I don't say shit cause she too sweet
She ride this dick up and down the street
She like when it hurt, I like when it's free
It must be the bird, it must be the bees
I think I said I love her, I was half asleep
I was caught in the moment, yeah
Then I was gone in the mornin', she called my phone in the mornin'
And started moanin' and groanin', well I be home in a moment
She say she work tonight, you better work tonight
And leave out that motherfucker with some merchandise
I ain't playin' with ya, you got some shit with ya
I'm a lil nigga, but I'm a big tipper
Cause it ain't nothin' to me, but you gotta work for it
Grind, grindin' on that wood, you got a surfboard

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Now I'm the boy she wanna ride with
She gone lie for me, kill for me, even shoplift
First class ticket, seat 1A
If I put her any closer she'll be riding in the cockpit
Took her to Benihanas, she can't even hold the chopsticks
She put her face down and hold her ass up like a hostage
Oh my God, I'm in love with a porn star
I'm in love with a foreign car, they both topless
I done tricked off a gold Rollie wrist watch
Man, I'm tired of dealing with these hoes but my dick not
So, I'mma make me that 7-11 pitstop
She leaned over like I love you, I'm just like bitch stop
You done fucked about half of hip hop
If I wife you they gon' talk about me like I'm Chris Bosh
Now I done got the honeymoon suite for common courtesy
The honeymoon suite? Hell yeah it's our one night anniversary
Bitch

My New York ho like fuckin' in a taxi

I got her hooked on a dick like it's phonics

She like to smoke a couple blunts fore we show the world
Got a chick out Tallahassee, she a cougar
She call me her lil Juvie, I gave her her groove back, she groovy
My Harlem chick, all we do is make movies
She like to see another bad chick eat Boosie
My Chi-Town chick, we have a gangster time
