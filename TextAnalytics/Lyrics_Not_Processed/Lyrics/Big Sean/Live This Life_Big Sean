[Intro: The Dream & 
Big Sean
]
Shit they got a picture of that shit?
Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now
I Do It, Boi, Do It
Multimillionaire 
This life is Top Floor y'know
B.I.....G. Sean Don Nigga, Finally Famous in this, Gettin' Money
Carrion, G.O.O.D
I wanna break you off like right now

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Hell yeah nigga high right now
That's the reason I said "hi" right now
Come have the time of your life right now
All you gotta do is close your eyes right now
This shit classic, they ask "where your outfit from?"
Plead the Saks Fifth, first class
Only culture games and practice
Oh you athletic? Shit, show me on the mattress
Cause it's already night time
And I feel like the right time
Twisting up my fingers
Like the young P-A-C, B-I-G but she just call me D-A-D
I do it

[Hook: The Dream & 
Big Sean
]
Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now
And I'mma need that penthouse on top of the world
That Detroit player on top of the world
Detroit players on top of your girl
It's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life..
Fancy things...
Flashing lights, 
it's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life..

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Hell yeah, nigga gone right now
That's why we should get gone right now
I'm trying to get you home right now
I bet I could turn you on right now
Really I can't call it
Stress turned me into a weed-head
And parties into an alcoholic
And money turned me into a workaholic
And money turned her into a twerkaholic
Yeah do it, do it, do it with no hands
Do it like you do it when you do it with your man
I could pull up in a Honda Civic, pulling bitches
Ain't about the cars, bout that nigga who is in it
Right here: and all I need is a minute
Start it up, guaranteed I'mma finish
In the nighttime, I feel like the right time
So here go the drink you've been waiting all life for
Make sure the muthafucking ice cold
My jewelry is ice-cold, stone is albino
Cause you're burning up, your outfit is dyno
Let's give em a light show

[Bridge: The Dream]
I ain't Paul McCartney or John Lennon
I ain't buying Beetles, I'm buying Benzes
They mad at you mamacita
Cause them bitches look like Bobby Bonilla

Oh shit I'm finally famous

And I'mma need that penthouse on top of the world
That Detroit player on top of the world
Detroit players on top of your girl
It's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life..
Fancy things...
Flashing lights, 
it's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life..
