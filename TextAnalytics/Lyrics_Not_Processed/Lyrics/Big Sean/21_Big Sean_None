*Lyrics from Snippets*

[Intro]
Finally famous in here
Yeah, for the money

[Chorus]
Now I moved out my mama crib when I was 21 (21, ha, yeah)
I got an older bitch, I make her feel like she was 21 (21)
That's player, that's player, that's player, that's player
These hoes wanna join the team, I treat 'em like I'm playin' 21 (21) Solo, solo, solo, solo
How many shots I finna take tonight? Like 21 (21)
For sure, for sure, for sure, for sure (Ha)
Bitch, I'm one of one

[Verse 1]
Now I treat every single day like it's a blessing, you know?
If ain't life or death, then what's the point of stressin', you know?
I'ma treat all my old relationships as lessons, you dig? (Yeah)
I'ma eat all that I can eat to put the rest in the fridge
I knew I was a millionaire, before I had it, yeah
Before the status, just the auditions and practice, yeah
Before I hit the bank and filled that bitch up with checks like a ballot
B.I.G. a health freak, I'm eating pussy and salad
Once you get to that palace, you can't go back to your last crib
And when you start pop-poppin' bottles, you can't go back to glasses
And once you get a Cleopatra, you can't go back to your last bitch
And when I turned 21, I realized that time ain't going backwards

[Chorus]
Now I moved out my mama crib when I was 21 (21, ha, yeah)
I got an older bitch, I make her feel like she was 21 (21)
That's player, that's player, that's player, that's player
These hoes wanna join the team, I treat 'em like I'm playin' 21 (21) Solo, solo, solo, solo
How many shots I finna take tonight? Like 21 (21)
For sure, for sure, for sure, for sure (Ha)
Bitch, I'm one of one, for sure though

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
Now I moved out my mama crib when I was 21 (21, ha, yeah)
I got an older bitch, I make her feel like she was 21 (21)
That's player, that's player, that's player, that's player
These hoes wanna join the team, I treat 'em like I'm playin' 21 (21) Solo, solo, solo, solo
How many shots I finna take tonight? Like 21 (21)
For sure, for sure, for sure, for sure (Ha)
Bitch, I'm one of one
