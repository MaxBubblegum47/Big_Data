I told my city I'll be back, but for now
I'm leaving, tell em I'm leaving
Promise I'll be back though, at least once a season
Tell em I'mma get it, I'm who they can believe in
I'mma bring it back like I kept all the receipts and
My hood show me love, I'm there to receive it
I know I run my city because I'm there to see it
It's hard being a citizen settling up in Michigan
I'm trying to make a name like a fucking birth certificate
Aww! Now a nigga on
And the DJ playing my song
And she wanna drink a little Dom Perignon
With Sean!

I pray that it ain't temporary
I've seen it in my dreams though
Mr. Visionary and I told them what it is though
Mr. Dictionary - they fuckin regular, I call em
Missionary like

[Hook]
Aww! Can't wait til I get back home
And I'mma put all my niggas on
And we gonna be the ones on TV, everybody
Gonna see me, you'll see man, Aww!
Can't wait til I get back home
And I'mma put all my niggas on

[Verse 2]
I walk up in this bitch like
Do I need an introduction?
When you living out your dreams
Sleep's an interruption. Man, I made
It out the city of corruption
With no concussion or a toolie tucked in
Yeah, we paid or we laid, no
Minimum wages. Yeah, what else can I say?
We ain't no bed or a lie but we made up
While they was all sleeping and laid up we stayed up
With drapes up like, Aww!
And I'mma be home soon as I get the crown and throne
And the name across it is my own
Who would've known that we'd be paid off
This musical grind. Unusual I, me
And my beautiful mind, that's why my niggas
High-class like a school in the sky. I spit
The heat, you might see a mirage but no facade

[Hook]
