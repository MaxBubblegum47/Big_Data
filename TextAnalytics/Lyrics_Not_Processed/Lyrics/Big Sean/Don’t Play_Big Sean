[Intro: Matty Healy]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No! He's to and fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Chorus: Travis Scott & 
Big Sean
]
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas (Straight up)
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas (Straight up)
I ain't playin' with these niggas (Oh no)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas (
Those niggas
, La Flame)
I ain't playin' with these niggas (Straight up, straight up)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Know I need my dollars
Know a nigga need my commas (Straight up)
She was down when I dropped out of college
Down, she was down when I rode Impalas (Slay)
Played with her pussy in the Jeep
Yeah, she was down with the foreplay drivin' (Oh no)
Jumped in the car when she hit my digits
Don't want nothin', just to pull up at the projects (Skrrt)
Easy to me, my nigga
Villa with a scene, youngin always seen with a killer (Straight up)
Hand-stitched by my dealer
Dealing with a seam you ain't seen, what you mean Margiela?
She even got the 'scripts for the cough
In the H gotta hit Johnny for the frost, swerved off
Ain't it been a minute since they seen a weird nigga from the corner put it on for the south? (Straight up)
On my mama, know a nigga be coastin' (Bless up)
Go, nigga, go, nigga, grab my bottles
Go, nigga, go, nigga, grab my chronic (That go)
Keep ya head up in the air, my nigga
Niggas gon' be billionaires, my nigga (Straight up)
Fuck, how much time that shit might take
Niggas, ain't playin' with 'em (Playin' with 'em, playin' with 'em, playin' with 'em)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & 
Big Sean

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Bitch, don't you play me, don't you try me
I need the exact amount
Look at my face, ho, eye-to-eye me
I'm a boss, make sure you and your homies dress up, tight attire
When you see me, ho, or I'll take that white tee and tie-dye dye it
I mean, goddamn, nigga
You forgot where I came from? I'm from where you ain't from
Where you can't come, where it ain't none
Where these bitches is bitches and they ain't nuns
Where they hate from
But as soon as you blow, they act like they been down since day one
Where there's fuckin' tank guns
But niggas never join the army, like it ain't one
If I ain't got it, then I'm huntin'
I'm either countin' or I'm cummin'
Swear I just done bought that mansion
Treat that shit like it's a dungeon
Up at 5 A.M., still workin', but I treat it like it's one
I'm never actin' like I got it
Bitch, I'm actin' like I won it on these niggas

[Chorus: Travis Scott & 
Big Sean
]
I ain't playin' with these niggas (
Niggas
, 
swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve
)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas (Straight up)
I ain't playin' with these niggas (
That Detroit nigga,
 La Flame)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playing with these niggas (
La Flame
, oh no)
I ain't playin' with these niggas (
Those niggas
)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas (
Niggas
)
I ain't playin' with these niggas (Straight up)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with theseâ€” (

[Outro: Travis Scott]
I ain't playin' with these niggas
