[Intro: Benny the Butcher]
Ah (
Hit-Boy
)

[Verse 1: Benny the Butcher]
I do this for sufferin' children and checks from government buildings
A dope boy who made a check from other than dealin'
What a good feelin' when they know you one in a million
The feds buried half of my niggas under the buildin'
Don't judge my life now, nigga, 'cause I been mad stressed
On tour with The LOX and had a project address
Before this rap shit, all my direct assets
Came from high-risk hazards, you know, Pyrex glasses
A long way to the Presi' from the Timex Classic
I got lines from a year ago that y'all just catchin'
I thought small, then I grew, got to find out it was true
Money change the people around quicker than it change you
You know what BIG said, I'm good long as the kids fed
How niggas throw dirt on your name and then beg?
Nah, we don't feel sorry for niggas, get bread
'Cause 'fore them California Kings we slept in a twin bed (Ah)

[Chorus: Benny the Butcher]
What's a king to a god, nigga?
 I'm gon' live forever
Feet on the ground, a hundred in the ceiling (Hundred in the ceiling)
I'm the last of this breed, you won't last in these streets long
If your only hustle drug dealin' (Drug dealin')
What's a king to a god, nigga?
 I'm gon' live forever (Live forever)
Nigga, I'm gon' live forever (Live forever)
This for hoes that's fuckin' rich niggas, you get a Rollie too
'Cause if I'm up, bitch, we gon' shine together

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I do this for my young, more precious than the Moon is to the Sun
I got more weapons than I'll ever need, I shoot you with each one
Talkin' cocaine out of Medell√≠n, my ho straight out the magazine
You drownin' in the fire while I'm snorkelin' in the gasoline
Steady diet of heavy drugs, roll up kush, yeah
Like Pirelli tires on Chevy trucks, but still a Goodyear
They got every eye on each one of us, well, nigga, look here
I'll come catch your ass on career day and end your career
I got pistols I just cleaned, I been tryna get dirty with you
I got niggas on my team, they ain't tryna swap jerseys with you
I pop and that thirty hit you, them shots from the thirty whistle
Watchin' movies with a bitch that wouldn't watch a commercial with you
I'm higher than everyone but Almighty
I treat the white girl like a wifey, 
treat her like Aphrodite
Let a goddess satisfy me while I'm rollin' the tighty
I chop the hands off the clock, that mean I'm timeless, don't time me, I'm forever

[Chorus: Benny the Butcher, 
Benny the Butcher & Big Sean
]
What's a king to a god, nigga?
 I'm gon' live forever
Feet on the ground, a hundred in the ceiling (Hundred in the ceiling)
I'm the last of this breed, you won't last in these streets long
If your only hustle drug dealin' (Drug dealin')
What's a king to a god, nigga?
 I'm gon' live forever (Live forever)
Nigga, I'm gon' live forever (Live forever)
This for hoes that's fuckin' rich niggas, you get a Rollie too
'Cause if I'm up, 
bitch, we gon' shine together

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I do this for the ones that's barely survivin'
Watchin' me, livin' through me, so I gotta stay thrivin', this shit a privilege, not promised
Dead honest 'cause I can't let shit live on my conscious
To multiply, I give it my undivided, you gotta move fast, think faster
Lately, my life been a lot of losses and less laughter
To paint the picture, I can't look the same in my before and afters
Honestly, I'm probably gon' be booked 'til I'm on the next chapter
Signed a slave deal, now a nigga up, ownin' my masters
Watch me turn G.O.O.D. into great
It's first steps to everything, even takin' leaps of faith
Swear it's labels that's up Bs that owe me Ms
To them, that shit is like Gs, niggas ain't G, greed's a disease
When you don't have a silver spoon, you gotta eat with your hands
God walkin' with me when I'm alone, two sets of feet in the sand
Realize you only as complete as your plan, might bleed from the hands
God body, why would I ever compare me to a man? Huh?

[Chorus: Benny the Butcher]
What's a king to a god, nigga?
 I'm gon' live forever
Feet on the ground, a hundred in the ceiling (Hundred in the ceiling)
I'm the last of this breed, you won't last in these streets long
If your only hustle drug dealin' (Drug dealin')
What's a king to a god, nigga?
 I'm gon' live forever (Live forever)
Nigga, I'm gon' live forever (Live forever)
This for hoes that's fuckin' rich niggas, you get a Rollie too
'Cause if I'm up, bitch, we gon' shine together (We gon' shine together)
