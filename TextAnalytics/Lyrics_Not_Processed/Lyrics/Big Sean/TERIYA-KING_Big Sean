We the Teriya-Kings Kings Kings Kings Kings [x4]

[Kanye West]
Verbal asked me do I need a pen?
Not right now
Everything I write now
I don't even write down
I don't need her right now
But I'm so bad
Ask her can she hold my gonads before they go bad
Since I did a song with Teriyaki I been acting very cocky
Using every opportunity to shit on everybody
If you heard I'll be in Houston like Bobby
Puffing on a blunt until the "B" got me body
There fees in the party?
Chillin' in the lobbies
Anything you heard happened, yo it probably did
Full Force trying to find where the Party is
For the last time to kick it like Karate Kid
Man that line was way obvious
Way out of my jurisdiction of my high snob
On my job kill a nigga no prob type flow
Just seen a nigga get Rob like Whoa!
Oh, should have tucked your chain
Niggas ain't playing man, it ain't a fuckin' game
All that frontin' for the audience
Make 'em not exist no more, Yugoslavians

(Yo
They try to jack my practice
Fully grown, fully blown, style's infectious
Why's it always VERBAL? The fact is
I'm in your face for ten years and still that fresh kid
Encrusted with stone colors never seen
Haters hate the accolades I get and underestimate
But wait, they still salivate
Looking at the chains I make
And they start calculating
Rumors start circulating
There's no relating
Y'all should be left out
This is my house, you don't like it?
Get the _______
So what now? Why you want to get with me?
Cuz I'm leaving legacies? 怒るでしかし!
全然デリカシー 無いとDANGER!
その頭はFAKE like it's アートの姉ちゃん
I'm that futuristic youth from Asia
If you can't comprehend then it's euthanasia)

[Verse 5: Big Sean]
Hit the stage see the floor all the seats obsolete
We gonna probably need more
And I don't walk around with an ID
Hit the club watch them line up like IV?
And hop up on that motherfuckin' carpet like HI-G?
I'm trying to get paid so I feel like a Cosby! Ching-Ching
Ooh yeah, Teriyaki Boyz, Big Sean we here
So make sure that camera's recording
I'm so important outfits imported
And your girl said "He's so ignorant"
So why the hell she can't ignore it
Dog, cause I'm everything you couldn't be
Everything you would be and everything I should be
