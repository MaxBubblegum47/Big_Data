Kids won't stay in their seats
They keep talking to me
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Man you know I love to read
Reading helps us learn information for school
So we can answer questions and we can be cool

[Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Who is for animals, peoples and things
(What is for what's happenin' in the story man

(where is for where the action happens
Why is for what the problem is)
How is for how the problem is solved now

From NC all the way to Hollywood
We're making lots of moves when our schooling is good
(Mr. Bonner is our teacher and he's doing big things
Showing us what hard work and dedication bring
We don't have time to play or clown around
Life is too good man, you don't have to frown
Learning how to read and passing all our tests
Ain't no telling what we'll do next

[Hook: Ellen]
Read it, read it, read it, read it
Read it, read it, read it, aye

[Hook: Lin-Manuel Miranda & Migos]
Read it, read it, read it, read it
Read it, read it, read it, aye
