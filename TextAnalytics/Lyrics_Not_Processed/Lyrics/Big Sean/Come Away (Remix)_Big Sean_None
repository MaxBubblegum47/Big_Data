[Verse 1: Elijah Blake]
Where you been all night?
Don't pretend you're so shy
I think not or maybe
Hot on the job, all week long
Tryin' to make you feel like a boss

[Pre-Hook: Elijah Blake]
We're dancin' in the dark baby
Come put your pretty lips on me
Don't wanna have to wonder "what if" in the morning

[Hook: Elijah Blake] (x2)
Can I have your heart for the weekend
Give it back to you when we finish
We can both kick back at mi casa
Won't you come away?

[Verse 2: Elijah Blake]
Everybody knows, everybody know that
They don't wanna go, they don't wanna go back
Once you had the best you knw when it's real
Everybody wants, everybody wants to
Be the one in charge, I be the soldier for you
Even when it's wrong I like how it feels

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay I walk in, sorta late
My girl don' watch, both coordinate
They both got that gorgeous face
Both shine, both mine
God damn I'm so fine
Getting green cause it's go time
You know those like supermodel girls you like?
Yeah I'm chilling with those kind
Slowly lil' [?] broady
You know you don't know me
Waitress bought out so much ice, ice, ice, it came with a goalie
I'm loosin', gues every team don't come with a Kobe
Okay "Hi, my name is" but you already know me
BIG

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook] (x2)

[Outro: Elijah Blake] (x4)
I promise
I'll give it back to you
I'll give back to you
After the weekend
