[Intro: Kanye West & 
Big Sean
]
Yeah
You know a nigga don't really wanna take his cool off, uh
(Boy, do it!)
 I'll express this, though

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash, 
Kanye West
, & 
Both
]
She call me early in the morning (
Early
, morning)
When she’s all alone
 (When she’s all alone)
I'ma take my time (
Yeah
)
Do it how we want (
Uh-huh
, do it how we want it)
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Sean & 
Kanye West
]
She love the way I’m doing it (She do it, 
huh?
)
So good she won't put my tattoo on it (
Uh
)
Bottom line is (
Uh
), you the finest
Gave you a new name
(What's that? What's that? What's) My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there
Let's capture this moment (Boy, boy)
If I hit it then I own it, marijuan'-in' every mornin' (We on)
And Patrón-ing, girl, we groaning (Do it)
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on
(Street lights on, on?) 'Cause you know I gotta go in 'til it's

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash, 
Big Sean
, & 
Both
]
Early in the morning
 (Morning, 
do it
)
When she's all alone (
Do it, I do
, when she’s all alone)
I'ma take my time (Time, 
boy
)
Do it how we want (Do it how we want it)
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play (And I'ma give it to ya)
The long way (And give it to ya)
The strong way (We got it all day)
It's our day (It's like this always)
It's our way (After a long day)
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Talk to the, talk to the hand
Bitch, you talking to a grown ass man
It's, like, way-way-way too much up in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak
(There goes the bed sheets)
Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? 'Cause I'm rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem?
Ah!

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash & 
Kanye West
]
Early in the morning (Morning)
When she's all alone (When she's all alone)
I'ma take my time (Time)
Do it how we want (Do it how we want it)
They say, "Yeezy, yeah, he just did it again!"
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play (And I'ma give it to ya)
The long way (And give it to ya)
The strong way (We got it all day)
It's our day (It's like this always)
It's our way (After a long day)
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Interlude: Kanye West]
I be saying, I, uh, I think
When I know, uh, just because

[Verse 3: Kanye West, 
Big Sean
, & 
Both
]
I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin'
And I swear you turn at least half-Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on (
Whoa
)
You should just go and throw a cape on (
Whoa
)
And it's just so amazing
So amazing, so amazing
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I'm speed racing
Leavin' with me, it'll boost your reputation
West side is where I'm stationed
Spend all night, just champagne-tasting
Ain't no rush, girl, let's just pace it 'til it's

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash, 
Big Sean
 & 
Both
]
Early in the morning (Morning, 
yeah
)
When she's all alone (
When she's all
 alone)
I'ma take my time (Time)
Do it how we want (Do it how we want it)
Just to set the mood, girl (Mood)
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play (And I'ma give it to ya)
The long way (And give it to ya)
The strong way (We got it all day)
It's our day (It's like this always)
It’s our way (After a long day)
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Outro: Roscoe Dash]
And this was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
