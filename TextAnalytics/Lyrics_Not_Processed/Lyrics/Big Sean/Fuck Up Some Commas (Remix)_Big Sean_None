[Verse 1: Future]
Smoke the first 48 hours
Grind 22 and sleep 2 hours
Put 24â€™s on the new Audi
White on white like baby powder
Drop ya bitch off at Fulton County
Might count it up and then re-count it
Double cups like Tunechi
Bust it down with these goonies, yeah
Give no fucks yeah, we don't give no fucks, yeah
Go fill my cup yeah, bitch go fill my cup, yeah
You heard that the slums made me, I'm cool with the Konvicts

Three hundred thou to five hundred thousand
A million, let's have a money shower

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
She so high, her nose bleedin', my coke clean like chlorine
Got a white girl and she barefoot in my old-school, my floors clean
Maybach that's two-tone, phone tapped, got a few phones
Headphones on my futon, gangsta on my Groupon
I don't bop, I do the money dance, nah, I call it that Robert Kraft
Your whole clique look dead broke
My young bitch said "Roger that"
All my dogs got fox furs, teacher said I was a big dummy
Bitch better come suck my dick
These diamonds on me cost big money
Waitin' you to come jump my fence
I paid the bitch off of brick money
Dade County my body count, I whack a nigga on Easter Sunday
Smoke a blunt and might eat some pussy
Tell the truth, my mind gone
Piaget cost one ticket, you could never be in my timezone

[Hook: Future]
Fuck up some commas, let's fuck up some commas yeah
Let's fuck up some commas, let's fuck up some commas yeah
Forty thou to a hundred thou

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Boy, I came from the grind up
I never threw the towel in, even in saunas
D hat on me, bitch, it's just to remind you
I knew I was riched up before I had commas
Back when I used to pull up in that Honda, police was behind us
I would still wake up like I'm in the Bahamas
Fuck a money counter, boy
I count this shit up faster than E. Honda
Threw a party wit' Future, that's Futurama
Got a future baby mama lookin' like a young Madonna
Mixin' wit' Rihanna, boy, I couldn't tell you where to find her
But I treat her like I'm finer
Man, y'all fucked the game up, boy, I got to reset it
I was born in '88, but I been ready since '87
No unleaded, countin' up Aretha Franklins, you got to respect it
What the fuck these niggas want from me, nigga?
She call me cause she want some company
I'm more focused on my company
If they want me, tell 'em they gon' have to come and hunt for me
Boy, I'm a beast, head over fireplace, nigga

Runnin' through the city on some Young Caesar shit

Yeah, just know I'm livin' single on some young Khadejah shit
And I'm checkin' for the commas on some English teacher shit
Little bitch
