[Intro: Big Sean]
Ugh (Cannon)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Couple niggas on a hit list and bitches on a different type
Same shit, different nights, 'til I live a different life
"Sean, you lookin' tired," damn, homie, that's all?
I've been stressing so hard I'm surprised I ain't going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into y'all, hating
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slipping like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleeping with that MAC and I ain't talking 'bout computer love
Owe the wrong people, you a price tag
Now you pray to God, hoping that you got a Christ tag (God)
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Take a elevator straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there, too, ugh

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

[Post-Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Ooh-ooh, if I just stop breathing
Even though I got all this motherfucking money
Won't keep my heart beating
Just don't wake me up (Don't wake me up)
You can't catch me dreaming
About all of this motherfucking money
Cocaine rush, I'm speeding
Cocaine rush

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, I'm just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me
I go extra harder the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection; at the same time, I'm acceptin' the fact
That there'll never be nothing perfect about me
Shit, I'm just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin
We are 6 Mile-bred, that's why you see our sick style, yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chicks, as y'all can imagine, is chatty, yapping at me
Five years ago, I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I'm Cali swagging
Huh, my nigga listen, I'm over the fame
You number one, I'm number 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin' with lames? We ain't rolling the same
I'm the best out in this motherfucker
If I could get a check out of this motherfucker
Big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this motherfucker with no regrets
If you ain't living your life for your kids, I ain't giving your ass no respect
(Sean, I love you, my nigga, I'm out)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I gotta break your fuckin' heart
I gotta climb these fuckin' charts (I gotta climb 'em)
I gotta do something that's innovative, creative
Just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia's momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty Carne Asada
I gotta, I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got aâ€”I got a fine, 'cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt
The youths need to know every detail about this Earth
The Devil controls it, so before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important, the end is near

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die
