[Bridge: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
And I wish that this could last forever
But maybe one night is even better
Real nigga mayne, all the people I plotted with
Is the same ones I'm dividin' the profits with
Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch
Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some Liu Kang shit
Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch
I come alive in the night, on some Bruce Wayne shit
Livin' my life, gettin' high payments
Fuckin' with some new broads and they high maintenance
And they wearin' high heels, trip so we're on high hills
Tits sittin' high, rollin' zips, gettin' high man

[Hook: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high
It's time to go

[Bridge: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Cause the penthouse 90 floors up
Make love and then join the mile high club
Yeah I'm on camera, fresh out of a sex scene
I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams
I'm in a new crib, so big, I'm talkin' town size
Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size
Yeah I gotta big head ho, I think it's crown size
Bitch I do it big and I never plan to downsize
People who talk shit, is feelin' like dickheads
Saw me on the web like I had a extra six legs
Lookin' at my highlights with a bitch with highlights
Crowd wavin' at me, all tryna say hi right

[Hook: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high
It's time to go

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
If you roll one up, I'mma roll one too
Oh you sayin' you don't smoke? Well that's all that we do
You be up in the club, I be up in the clouds
Ooh, don't gotta ask me if I brought enough cause' we don't run out
Blow it by the O, even my fans smoke it
Cause' they throw it at my shows hidin' it when I travel
In case the police gotta know, rollin' it up in traffic
Make you smoke out of a bong, put you on different hashes
My chick is the baddest, my spliff is the fattest, I'm livin' so lavish
Gotta patch a lil kid tryna get at this cabbage
My pinky ring a V8, I filled it with carrots
I'm popeye with spinach, till' the day I die I'm gettin' high

[Hook: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]

I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me

[Verse 4: Chiddy Bang]
I'm fly, my swell on Priceline
Truthfully I want this shit to last a lifetime
Simply amazing, we blazin' as we just write rhymes
Cold flow, ice time, breakin' down bright pines
Enough with all the beefin' I'm over it
Outta town kush, but they smokin' that local shit
I always knew that I would be the man
They ride the greyhound, but I'm more a peter pan, we the fam
Off the scale, yeah we about to break the richter quick
Loud, yea it's worth a thousand words on some picture shit
When it comes to smokin' we have a certificate
I know them haters is wishin' we fakin', licorice
Fuck it we up, my nigga Sean gave me another L
I need a high class chick that I match up with well
She familiar with Fendi, comfortable in Chanel
And you know errthang' high when you livin' swell

[Hook: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high
It's time to go
