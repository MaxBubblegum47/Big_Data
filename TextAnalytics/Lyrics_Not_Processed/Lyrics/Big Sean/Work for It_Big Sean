[Intro: Big Sean,

, & 
DJ Khaled
]
Oh
Yeah
Oh, oh
Metro Boomin wants some more, nigga
You make me wanna
Yo, yo, yo (make me)
DJ Khaled!

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't go to church though
I still bless you, but you know what come first though
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
You, you gon' get this Rollie off the wrist, yeah
You gon' have my phone full of all your pics, yeah yeah
You gon' have me flying in and out of town
You said you've been losing weight and dropping pounds
Damn, I think I'm 'bout to leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
I had you after twelve but you came right after at two
I could have anything I'd want but I still want you
That's the truth
I'm not really into the sentimentals
Just me and you behind the tinted windows
While you throwing all these innuendos
We just finna fuck up all the incidentals at the SLS
That's LA confidential
Show me everything that you've been through
We only do what we meant to like, woah
This that titties on the glass, pull the curtains shit
This that fuck you in the air, no service dick
This that call his ass right now, say you're deserting him
This that call him while we fucking so he heard the shit

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't go to church though
I still bless you, but you know what come first though
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Money stalking me, its like the money talk to me
So if you ain't talking 'bout money then don't talk to me (shh)
I work with dope boys, I keep a fork on me (skrt)
I'm in my drop top
But won't let you get the drop on me (catch up)
I keep the yop on me and trouble seems to follow me
I take my pistol to the mall, my pistol shop with me
That bitch is jockin' me, and young niggas admire me
Yeah, but I'm a product of the streets so they won't hire me

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Can't let you play me off the streets you know I got kids
And more major keys than a locksmith
I could teach you niggas how to rock this
My bed was a pallet on the carpet
My ride was a bus named MARTA
Pillow full of Estee Lauder
Nigga, I'm allergic to a Charger
Nothing but foreign cars in my garage, ah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't go to church though
I still bless you, but you know what come first though
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
I'm takin' risks, she takin' pills, takin' pics
Day job night job, Jamaican shit
I stick to the basics, not a basic bitch
You deserve a young young legendary
Heartthrob speeding up your respiratory
Treat these others hoes secondary
I couldn't even cheat with my secretary
Faithful to you even when I'm on road
Even if I'm on a different coast
I'mma still make you feel close, mama
I'm addicted to your ass and titties
When you dance the bedroom turn to Magic City
Got my ass throwing hundreds, fifties
Outta thin air, yeah thats magic tricking
I take you to the Caribbean
Make your mind as clear as the water you swimming in
In and out that bitch like we amphibians
I won't change you up next season
For another chick like they did Aunt Vivian
I'mma put you on the businesses
I'mma divy up the dividends
I'mma show you what the fuck commitment is, baby
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give
Girl you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this feel like déjà vu

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for (work, work)
Make me, make me
What I worked for (work, work)
(do it, do it, do it, damn, do it)
You make me wanna
Oh my god
Eh, eh, eh
