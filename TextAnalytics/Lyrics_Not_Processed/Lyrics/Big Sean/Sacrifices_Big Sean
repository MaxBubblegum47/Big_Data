[Intro: Big Sean & Future]
Brrrt!
I look up, so many (On my don shit)
So, so many
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I done made sacrifices (I, I)
So many sacrifices (Straight, straight up)
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain’t free
Fuck it, I sacrificed it (Fuck it, I sacrificed it)
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (Straight up)
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices (Woah)
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Fuck what you telling me, I sense the jealousy
I got telepathy, I got the recipe
I got the streets and I don’t got no felonies
Forward thinking, yeah my mind is ahead of me
Momma said it's gonna be whatever you let it be
It's some homies I grew up with that's dead to me
It's some niggas that I just met in debt to me
What's in common is they both pay respect to me
I get it my way from Friday to Friday
My girl is a mix of Aaliyah and Sade
I came a long way from that "Marvin and Chardonnay"
I pull out the driveway like I’m in a car chase speeding!
And if my bitch cheat she know I’m leaving!
No text, no call boy
That bitch airplane mode, cold
No peacoat, no time to change clothes
Same clothes, love if you living by the same code
G-code, leave ho
Fuck it you dead to me, back to my destiny
Penthouse, birds eye view, that's a nest for me
I got my self out of debt
So when you see me, know you're somebody I'll never need

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I done made sacrifices (I, I)
So many sacrifices (Straight, straight up)
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain’t free (Free)
Fuck it, I sacrificed it (Fuck it, I sacrificed it)
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (Straight up)
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices (Woah)
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Big Sean]
I cut the fuck shit drama out my energy
Focused on the inner me, never on the enemy
And I done sacrificed my own time, I done sacrificed my own mind
I done sacrificed the club life, I done sacrificed my love life
Look, I cut the fuck shit drama out my energy
Focused on the inner me, never on the enemy
And I done sacrificed my own time, I done sacrificed my own mind
I done sacrificed the club life, I done sacrificed my love life

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
I done sacrificed the thug life (Hey), diamonds shining ain't no dull life (Shine)
Drop my top to get my mind right (Skrt), pull up in the 'Rari, loud pipes (Skrr)
Bitch, I'm the don, my wrist a hundon (Patek)
Ooh, yeah, Gucci python (Yeah)
Ooh, yeah, she play with her tongue
Yeah, I bought that bitch a new charm (Woo)
Lit nigga pop one, I told her come see about me (Come on, come see me)
The devil had entered my soul, my momma had beat it out me (The devil, my momma)
Remember my grandmama had told me you better be somebody (Be somebody)
Hop in my seats massaging (Ah!)
Watch how I lead the posse (Come on), I made an M deposit (Hey)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Paid all these dues with the game (Yeah yeah)
Sacrificed yo stripes for that stain (Sacrifice)
Heard you sacrificed your life for that chain (Yeah yeah)
She sacrificed that money for cocaine (White, phew, coco)
Left hand got three rings, that's Bron Bron, we up one
Bad bitch she a savage, take her to the mall and buy her something (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's gonna wanna make your friends come (Yeah, hey)
Make way with the tommy gun (Tommy gun, brrt)
Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice? (Woo, woo)
Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice? (Hey)
Ten toes, yeah, you gotta stay down, ayy (Woo)
Just some young niggas looking for a way out, ayy (Woo)
People watchin', yeah, I gotta skip town, ayy (Woo)
Hit my phone if you need a whole pound, ayy

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I done made sacrifices (I, I)
So many sacrifices (Straight, straight up)
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain’t free (Free)
Fuck it, I sacrificed it (Fuck it, I sacrificed it)
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (Straight up)
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices (Woah)
Fuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Big Sean & Quavo]
I know my great, great, great aunty was a slave (I know)
I could only imagine all the sacrifice she made (I can only imagine)
I could only imagine all the shit she had to take (I can only imagine)
I'ma make sure all the blood she gave wasn't in vain (Damn)
I sacrificed for your entertainment boy, I'm Mr. Anderson in the Matrix
Check the last name it's all facts and the human race is all about pacing (Damn)
Look at all the ones I outlasted, I'm the one at the end like I count backwards
Never satisfied, details classifie 'til the afterlife, make a sacrifice, Don (Don)
Why can’t y’all recognize that we all came from sacrifice?
Why can’t y’all recognize that we all came from sacrifice?
