[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
All my mami's bounce
I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
This the remix
I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi ('Cause I luh my papi)
All my mami's bounce
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
JLo, DJ Khaled
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi

[Verse 1: Tyga, French Montana & DJ Khaled]
I keep it trill for a baddie like you
'Cause you a bad chick and your friends bad too
Your body is my temple, I'ma have to praise you (Montana)
Or write it on the wall, I'ma have to tattoo (DJ Khaled)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
I love you, mami, I-I love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami (Haa)
Sh-sh-shorty got me catching feelings (Haa)
In that Wraith drop, reaching for the ceiling
Southside Bronx, Teterboro just overseas
Take the pins out her hair, drop to her knees (Whoop!)
Oh my, I'm a don like Omar (Omar)
Speed it up slow ma, throw it back, toma (Haa)
Rock-rock Gators like my Detroit players
You can hate to love us, you can love to hate us (Haa, whoop!)
From the bottom it been real
From the bottom shorty been trill (Ha)
And even though we made it to the top
Still JLo from the-the the block
Ay, I love you, mami, I-I love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Big Sean]
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi (B.I.G. Sean Don)
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi (What? Okay)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Do you love me? Do you swear?
Am I still the one? Even when I'm not there (Woah)
'Cause you know how it go and go
When you wanna go and go
Have you seen what's her face? (Who?)
Is her number in your phone?
And your answer's yes and yes
But you still say no and no
Even though I know you know
I know I know you know I know
You know? It sound dumb-de-dumb-dumb
They say what we want's wrong, fuck it
Least know what we want
And it sucks to see you cry
Know a brokenhearted girl could make the whole world drown (Drown)
And even though your makeup smears
Man I'm the one that's been the clown, why the fuck we around?
'Cause girl, you know I got that jaw drop shit (Yeah)
Plus I know your insecurities, that mall cop shit (Oh God)
I give you that screwface shit (Freaky)
Bring the ugly side out, two-faced shit (Woah)
Tryin' all new ways shit (Mmmhmm)
One night turn into a few days shit (I luh you, JLo)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you, and I need you now
Ain't had none like you in a while (This the remix)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Big Sean]
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi

I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
All my mami's bounce

I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
All my mami's bounce
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi (JLo)
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi (Sean Don)

[Verse 3: Tyga & DJ Khaled]
Who that? Better than your T, pop your Rolex
Get you one limit, spend 'til you headache (Dizzy)
We can go rounds when you ready
Lightweight, pack heavy overnight like a Fed-Ex (You know)
I like 'em brown, Puerto Rican, JLo
You the only one like a peso, long pretty pelo
Mami be the angel with that halo
T-Raw playa, leave her 'round me I'ma take her (Ay)
Switchin' lanes, top off, we off topic
What you talkin'? If you ain't talkin' how we stuntin'
Where it's tropic, we ain't waitin' for the summer
I know you wanna scream it, ay, ay (Let's ride)
Yeah, yeah, haha
I luh you too JLo, yeah

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez]
All day, 24 hour
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drive it how you want, I ain't tryna count mileage
I'm loving me some you
Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof
'Cause I love my papi

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
