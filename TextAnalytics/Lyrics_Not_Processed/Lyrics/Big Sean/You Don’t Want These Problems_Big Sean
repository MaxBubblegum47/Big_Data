[Intro: Ace Hood & DJ Khaled]
We the motherfuckin' best
DJ Khaled

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Khaled]
You haters can't stop me, I'm a franchise
You're now rockin' with the best, put your hands high

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Do it, do it, I'ma fuckin' do it
These niggas try to hold me back, I swear I've been through it
Middle finger to 'em all, I'ma make 'em pay
PSA for any nigga standin' in the way
You don't want these problems
You don't, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
Nigga you don't want these problems

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Oh God! I tell 'em nigga, you don't want these problems
You don't, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Maybach Music
Out in Vegas like Lamar, third floor Tropicana
Fascinated with the cars, smokin' dope in the Phantom
Teflon's on the rise, I despise propaganda
Camouflage Mac-11, I should set an example
Never baptized, as I walk through the fires
The pain and the flame never match my desires
Crucified cause I'm rich, in the coupe, take a pic
On the phone at the light, Kelly Rowland's a friend
Catfish in the Benz, Manti Teo's a sucker
Plaques on the wall, hustler so I can say "fuck 'em"
Bel Air for the hoes, Ciroc in the pool
My bitch is a stripper, her name is April's A Fool
Maybach Music

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Khaled]
You haters can't stop me, I'm a franchise
You're now rockin' with the best, put your hands high

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Do it, do it, I'ma fuckin' do it
These niggas try to hold me back, I swear I've been through it
Middle finger to 'em all, I'ma make 'em pay
PSA for any nigga standin' in the way
You don't want these problems
You don't, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
Nigga you don't want these problems

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I said "haaaan!" That's what the title say
Cause I'm rich, homie, it's why you feel some kind of way
She threw the pussy and I caught it, presidential 'bout 40
That drop head from Europe, that coupe got deported
I turn coke boy to that corporate money
Big choppa, I'm walkin' funny
Money talk but you ain't talkin' money
You ain't even got no corporate money
Haaaan! Whip game proper, I'ma make it work
Versace, Versace, nigga know who did it first

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
We the best, Khaled tried to told ya
TRUUUU! You just second best, Kelly Rowland
(Hahaha, I'm just playin' babe)
Uh, renegade like Em and Jay
VIP section, started out from section 8
Arm and Hammer, I'm armed with the hammer
If it was a slumber party, I'd be fresh in pajamas
Silence the shawty, I'm killin' them softly
They slept on me, I stopped sellin' work and started sellin' them coffee

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Khaled]
You haters can't stop me, I'm a franchise
You're now rockin' with the best, put your hands high

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
I stay jumpin' out that thing ho, I swear that's word to my momma
I took risks with that 'caine, ho and I sold work for my momma
These niggas don't want no drama
These niggas don't want no problems
These niggas don't want no beef
Have 'em walkin' out with that choppa
These North niggas don't play that
They murk somethin', I'll tell you that
200 change for this Mulsanne and the wheel's a fortune, Pat Sajak
We catch cases, don't say jack
Don't talk work cause they tape that
Don't sell the work where we lay at
And don't spend the bread you can't make back, no

[Verse 5: Ace Hood]
Rest in peace
I'ma start murderin' and bodyin' beats
Ain't no defeatin' the eye of the beast
And I'm laughin' at people who try to compete
Name any rapper that's fuckin' with me
I'm who these niggas pretendin' to be
Claimin' you wantin' these problems
Tell momma get flowers and plannin' your funeral speech
My sanctuary's that cemetery
My choppa, named it "Obituary"
Act up, Tyler Perry
Boy you sweeter than February
Real nigga, I define that
You don't even need no dictionary
You ain't even 'bout that life
So these shooters with me ain't necessary

[Chorus: Big Sean]
You don't want these problems
You don't, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
Nigga you don't want these problems

[Bridge: Timbaland]
You don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
You ain't know
You don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
You ain't know
You don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
You ain't know
You don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
You ain't know

[Outro: Big Sean]
Yeah, you don't want these problems
You don't, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
Nigga, you don't want these problems
Oh God! I tell 'em nigga you don't want these problems
You don't, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems
