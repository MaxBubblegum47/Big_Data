[Intro: Big Sean]
Do or die
Look, all I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
And when you feel something you can't see
But you know it's meant to be
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me yeah
Bigger than me, bigger than me
When the whole family depend on you to eat
And at night you can't sleep
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Get it, get it, get it
I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha
I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture
Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister
I see myself in the young ones
When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror
Corleone all on my own (Don)
Cartier all on my arm
All I hear is sirens  and car alarms
Niggas going to war with no armor on
First time I seen a dead body I was 14
And I felt the pressure
Like if I don't get it, I might end up next to him
I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7
Seven, seven, seven, 7-11
 it's 911 getting called around
The hood America's lost and found
Where niggas get lost and never found
All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and a Mercedes key
Got it and I still felt incomplete
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Chorus: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
You gon' realize that this was bigger than me

[Bridge: Starrah]
Used to want that foreign
Got that foreign, now it's boring
Started touring
Swear to God that's when I realized this shit was bigger than me
Flex on niggas with a Rollie
Got that Rollie with the shine
But lost my time
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I seen people in the same place 10 years later
Man that shit pathetic
God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it
I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan
When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man
If I ain't special why I feel it then?
I gotta get on the road
I gotta be the one chose
I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told
This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close
And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed
And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah

[Chorus: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya

[Outro]

[Myra Anderson:]
 Well no matter what, I'm proud of you. Even when you do stupid things that I have warned you about. You must get that from your daddy. I'm just kidding, you know I love you. You listening?

[Big Sean:]
 Yeah yeah, I'm listening. I love you too

[Myra Anderson:]
 In a way I feel like I'm living through you. Sometimes it feels like I got another chance at everything

[Big Sean:]
 
Man that's deep you feel like that. I kinda feel the same way though sometimes

[Myra Anderson:]
 Yeah

[Big Sean:]
 
With all the work that's goin' on I feel like this is like my second time doin' it so I know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life and just regretted it all and somehow, this is my chance to go back and get it all right. And when I wake up, with that mindset, you know, it completely changes my hunger, how I approach the whole day. I mean you decide to live your life like that then pshh, man I guarantee we'll live life to our best potential

[Big Sean (future self):]
 It's that simple. It's all about living in the moment.
