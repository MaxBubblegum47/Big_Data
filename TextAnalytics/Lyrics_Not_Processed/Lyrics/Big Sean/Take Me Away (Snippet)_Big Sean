[Hook]
Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way
(Pick your planet, break it, roll it, blow it, then get blown away.)
(Pick your planet, break it, roll it, blow it, then get blown away.)

[Verse 1]
5,4,3,2,1 blunts passed off
Pick your planet, roll it, toke it, smoke it, then we blast off
I'll probably be on mars when I light up
Clean up, then head down to Venus to get wifed up
The nigga in me wanna go to Pluto to get iced up
Race through space
Damn these colors vibrant
I'm going on a trip without the luggage
But there's baggage cause I bagged it
If the police see I have it
Flash the badge and they'll try to

[Hook]
(Cuts off)

[Outro]
Man you already know
I cannot give you all that shit man
That's for the album
Finally Famous the album coming to you
When is that shit coming
It's coming to you weeks from now, months from now
Soon as hell man
UKNOWBIGSEAN lets get back to it
