[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
Hold up, to be clear (Yeah, 
Mike WiLL Made-It
)
I believe in miracles (Yeah)
But I don't believe in waitin' for 'em (Nah)
You gotta make that shit happen (Yeah)
In ways they cannot imagine (Yeah)
Make them think it's magic (Yeah)
It ain't your chain or your vehicles (Yeah)
When you that nigga with the bag (Yeah)

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Just be that nigga with the bag (Yeah)
So when they say, "Who is that?" (Yeah)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (Yeah)
They be like, "Who that rolling past?" (Yeah)
Oh, that's that nigga with the bag (Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
You do what you do 'til you disappear
I'll take two whips for souvenirs
She said, "Swae Lee, aren't you a Gemini?‚Äù
No, I'm that nigga with the bag (Woo)
Say it loud and clear (Listen here)
It's loud diamonds in my ear (In my ear)
You took all day at the Gucci store (Yeah)
You take all day when you in the store (Yup)
But, baby, I'm not even mad
We steppin' out Ferrari, matte
I got the vibe of a UFO (Ooh)
If you ain't spendin', what you in here for?
You see, I had to customize my life (My life)
Always rollin' up in everybody's section
When you that nigga that run with the bag (Bag)
You can't help but to leave a good first impression (Hey)

[Chorus: Pharrell & 
Quavo
]
Just be that nigga with the bag (Yeah, 
bag
)
So when they say, "Who is that?" (Yeah, 
who that?
)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (Yeah, 
bag
)
That close encounter ridin' fast (
Skrrt, skrrt

(What was that spaceship riding past?)
That be the nigga with the bag - Yugo, Yugo, Yugo (
Ayy

That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo (

[Verse 2: Quavo & 
Big Sean
]
I'ma get that bag, that's her favourite (Ayy)
Aye, new blue money, that's my fragrance (Oh yeah)
Aye, magnet to that bag, we don't chase it (Ayy)
Got my main and my side swappin' places, yeah (Swap out)
Securin' the bag, it's safe (Safe)
I got a bag of faces (Bag)
I am a fashion statement (Fashion)
Culture my human races (Culture)
It don't matter 'bout the ice (No)
If you can't pay the price (No, 
price
)
Just be that nigga with the bag (Cash)
Gotta gamble with your life

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look, I'm into taking risk and chances (Whoa)
Big advances (whoa) big expansions (Yee)
Hit a lick an' I get the Billy Jean dancin' (Brrrt!)
Only time I pick is for the ransom
I work way too hard
To me, work is not a job (No)
To me, working is a purpose (Work)
If it ain't that, then it's worthless (Worthless)
And I carry all my burdens
Hardly ever needed help (Whoa, whoa)
I'm the help my family needs
I just cash 'em out myself (Right there)
Bitch, I'm on some other shit
I got abducted by the mothership
But came back down just to run this shit
I want the double R, the double M
I take the work, put the double in, game, triple double it, I'm gone

[Verse 4: Slim Jxmmi]
I'm goin' hard for this, I put my heart in this
I'm addicted and it's hard to quit
Started off in them apartments
Now I hang with the stars and shit
Customize my cars and shit
It's her first time in a Lambo
Had to show her how to start the whip
I'm a young nigga with a bag
Watch how large it get, 50K in my Amiri jeans
I fuck around and blow all this shit, Jxmmi got all the drips
You ain't never seen sauce like this, I shop on all the strips
Told shorty to lick the tip, she pulled out all the tricks

[Bridge: Pharrell]
But then the insecurity sets in
You ride around like the Jetsons
You're the sun's reflection
You shinin', come on, hello (That Yugo)

[Chorus: Pharrell]
You see that watch, that's made of glass (Go)
It's on the wrist that grip the bag (Go)
What was that spaceship ridin' past? (Yugo)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
He do more prayer hand than brag (Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
He do more prayer hand than brag (That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (That Yugo, Yugo)

[Outro: Pharrell]
Go, go, Yugo
Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
