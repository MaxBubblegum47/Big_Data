Yes I do love money
Keep my whole click stuntin'
Nothin' but them hundreds
Keep the ones don't want em'
Yes I do love money
Keep my whole click stuntin'
Nothin' but them hundreds
Keep the ones don't want em'
Yes I do love money
Yes I do love money
Yes I do love money
Keep my whole click stuntin'
Yes I do love money
Yes I do love money
Yes I do love money
Keep my whole click stuntin'
Nothin' but them hundreds
Nothin' but them hundreds
Nothin' but them hundreds
Keep the ones don't want em'
Nothin' but them hundreds
Nothin' but them hundreds
Nothin' but them hundreds
Keep the ones don't want em'

[Soulja Boy]
L-o-v-e m-o-n-e-y
Cop a True Religion tee and threw three hundred in the sky
Polo shoes on my feet and my pants are saggin'
Lookin' so pretty you'd thought I was a faggot
Watch the hood get it
Cook it like chicken
And I got the combo (and it came with biscuits)
And I got the combo (and it came with biscuits)
And I got the combo (and it came with biscuits)

[Big Sean]
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Why everything green is good for me
I'm what these bitch ass niggas couldn't be
Six Mile that's just the hood in me
Peep my ghetto poetry
I'm getting high and rappin' that's flow-a-tree
Is that a green carpet nah the hole floor a tree
I swear to god it ain't no ho in me
But I'm into hoes
I'm probably in ya' ho
Aww shit, there go a staple
At least you know my bitch centerfold
I belong in a Guinness from worldstar I rented
Don't fuck with these niggas
I'm fuckin' they misses
I'm stackin' my money
My money get interest
My interest get business
My business get bitches
B-I-G BITCH
I DO IT
