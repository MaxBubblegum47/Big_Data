[Chorus]
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass
Stop, now make that motherfucker Hammer time like
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid
Do it boi, do it boi, boi, boi
Drop it, drop it

[Verse 1]
Wobbledy wobbledy, wo-wobble wobble
I'm stacking my paper, my wallet look like a Bible
I got girlies half naked, that shit look like the grotto
How your waist anorexic and then your ass is colossal? Like woo
Drop that ass, make it boomerang
Take my belt off, bitch I'm Pootie Tang
Tippy tow, tippy tay, you gon' get a tip today
Fuck that, you gon' get some dick today
I walk in with my crew, and I'm breaking they necks
I'm looking all good, I'm making her wet
They pay me respect, they pay me in checks
And if she look good, she pay me in sex
Bounce that ass, it's the roundest
You're the best, you deserve a crown bitch
Right on that ass

[Chorus]
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass
Stop, now make that motherfucker Hammer time like
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid
Do it boi, do it boi, boi, boi
Drop it, drop it

[Verse 2]
Okay stop, drop it, drop it
You got everybody in here, oh my goshing
Bad bitches I'm your dada, white girls go Gaga
When the sticks out they bust it open like ya ya's a Pinata
Bitch look down, tell me what's up
Girl you talk too much, shut up
I got that mad dick, you know it always nut up
And it got an attitude, no wonder why it's stuck up
Pop it then backflip, yo gymnastics got me ecstatic
Your whole crew look like a pageant
I'm dropping cash tips and some taxes
Girl you got me about to pass out
I'm wondering if cupid gave you ass shots
'Cause I'm in love with that ass

[Chorus]
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass
Stop, now make that motherfucker Hammer time like
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid
Do it boi, do it boi, boi, boi

[Bridge]
Whoa, white girls, black girls, tall girls, fat girls
Shake that ass shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass, shake that ass, shake that ass
Short girls, small girls, skinny girls, all girls
Shake that ass shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass, shake that ass, shake that ass
And I want all of that

[Chorus]
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass
Stop, now make that motherfucker Hammer time like
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid
Do it boi, do it boi, boi, boi
Go stupid
