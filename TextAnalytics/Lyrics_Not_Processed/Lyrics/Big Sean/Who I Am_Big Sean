[Chorus: Pusha T]
Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am
Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They said be all you can be, nigga
They said be all you can be
Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee-deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends
Same block, same rock
I was thinking 'bout murdering
I ain't getting my hands dirty
Let you worry 'bout serving 'em

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Yaagh! They said be all you can be, nigga
Woooh! They said be all you can be, nigga
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am

[Bridge: Pusha T]
Yaagh! They said be all you can be, nigga
Woooh! They said the truth set you free

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Entrepreneur, strip club connoisseur
Hot fudge sundae, pour it on you, hallelujah
Pour it on you, hallelujah, pour it on you, hallelujah
And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you, ah
Red, white, blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life
Even if it's leftovers, I still gotta eat, right?
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-popping her jeans tight
All day I dream about sex, three stripes
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool

[Bridge: Pusha T]
They said be all you can be

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Pretty girls is my reputation
One on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to it, no hesitation
To fuck with me you need a reservation
To the top escalating, elevating
Good music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going 'til I K.O., eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they roll, even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him
All night and all day and all night and all day
And all night like that shit's his motherfuckin' soulmate
'Cause no time for hand to hand
When you got this paper hand in her hand
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, nigga, na-na, na-na, na
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy
'Cause I still love to get pampered
But don't get it twisted, watch your step and fuckin' manners

[Bridge: Pusha T]
They said the truth set you free!

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am

[Outro: Pusha T]
Woooh! I just wanna be who I am Woooh!
Woooh! I just wanna be who I am Woooh!
Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee-deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends
