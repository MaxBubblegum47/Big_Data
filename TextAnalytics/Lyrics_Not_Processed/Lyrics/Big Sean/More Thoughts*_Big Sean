[Intro]
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
Look, bitch, please don't act like my friend, be my friend
My mama said, "Don't act like a man, be a man
Quit going overboard," I think it's finally sinkin' in
KeY Wane on the beat, you know that be my favorite BPM
Hol' up, fuck me over once, you never seein' me again
Fuck me over twice, then I'm the last thing you see
Never thought I'd be investin' in restaurants with Hov
And see my movie theater in downtown Detroit opening doors
Dawg, I see niggas get buried in suits that never wore suits
That shit can get deep as my Nigerian roots
And I need therapy too, someone that cares for me too
Someone who there for me to the point
When they not there, it still feel like they there for me too
My zone is not a comfort zone, you can't compare me to you
That's mastermind advice, livin' a life that's overpriced
Lookin' like I sold my soul, bought it back, then I sold it twice
No, it's just years in the makin'
Love makin' is the only thing happenin' overnight
Look, dawg, I been meditating on top of the mountain
So many lies spread about me, no point in respondin'
I realized that some stars live way above the comets
Million dollar deals on my iPhone, signature in theâ€“
