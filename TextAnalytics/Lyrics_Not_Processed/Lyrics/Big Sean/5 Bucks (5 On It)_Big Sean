[Verse 1: Big Sean]
OK, I'm smoking loudly, I woke them all
I pick up that tree, when it's not fall
I'm gone off that tree, when it's not tall
I'm in love with tree, I'm a Avatar
I pick up a O from, my nigga Ralphy
My bro and me but he is not alphy
Gone off that goo punch, it makes me drowsy
Roll up the windows, it makes it cloudy
Damn, if you ain't know
I made these girl night, smoking paper and bowls
My ladies like blunts, hit 'em twice if not once
Then I blow 'em off and just pass 'em to my bro
Now catch me getting brain if a nigga not learning
I be spending money if a nigga not earning
Catch me in the backseat if I'm not stirring
And I be rolling up if a nigga not burning, boy

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (Got it, good), grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it (Got it, good), it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper:]
You know a nigga like to stay at that cruising altitude up in the sky
Try to fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high
Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches we prefer the cigarillo smoke
If you say it take away from taste then get some better smoke
Cause this shit I blow can get smelt on the next block
Ain't no middle mans every thing you need is in stock
This Glock is all the security I need
I be solo dolo, when you see me blowing on some weed
Why speed, no need, I be just taking it slow
I be so clean, diesel over powers my cologne
Now all the bad bitches who blazed on shifting this way
Y'all just some white belts, with leaves I am the sensai
Now bow to the bag never, save the best for last
When I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass
Fuck a dime sack, let's cop a quarter pound now
What the fuck is you gon' put down?
Nigga I got five

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (Got it, good), grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it (Got it, good), it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Hot wired, 6-4 hydraulics
Not stolen, lost my keys, I was high partna'
Fuck you want? This the raw paper not a blunt
You must, got me mixed up with Chip cause, This Spitta
Zig zag a whole zip up, shit strong shoulda' came with a bed pick up
Bitches calling me, wanna smoke beggin' for me to pick up
She blow me while I'm blowin' rings of that killa'
That weed you smoking brown, fake weed too much make up, clown
Get real smoking green, strawberry fields
High standing up feelin' like I'm layin' down, couple boujee Judy's came round
Actin' all stuck up, now they just stuck from smokin' with us
Had the hallway smellin', Is my windows opening enough?
I hear walkie talkies, Is security coming up?
Fuck

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (Got it, good), grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it (Got it, good), it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack
