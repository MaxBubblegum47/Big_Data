[Big Sean]
Make a freak my intern
Work yo ass up to CEO
If it's one thing I hate, damn I hate me a greedy hoe
Bitch, I don't need you
Say you never did, I don't believe you
Champagne spilling that's just pain killing
Out of it, but ain't a dollar that I ain't missing
Trying to take it, bet I ain't missing
Bang bang got his brains dripping
Started chasing paper, pussy came with it
Yup, I'm on G connected though
Presidential suite, presidential weed respect my vote
Me and Juicy J, doing numbers we projected hoe
Bitch nigga's talking shit, it don't effect us though, just keep it...

[Juicy J]
High yellow Chick got me hypnotized
Got me in a trance now I’m poppin’ bandz
Avrah Kadabra I’m in her pants
Twenty minutes later now I’m in her friend
And we in my Benz
Playin’ hokey pokey cause if she drop out another bitch hop in
All I know is that feddy you broke nigga you petty
Juicy j I hustle hard and im slicker than k-y jelly
Hold up I’m just tryin to find me a Nicki Minaj
Come here pretty chick give my dick a message
Freaky chick I’m about to hit in the car
She threw it back before I even pulled in the garage
Hit the dealership they tried to play me niggas must be trippin’
Do a couple hundred bandz on the floor
Now you actin like a stripper tryin’ to make his commission
It’s all mine and I spend it
Don’t worry about it I got plenty
I got your baby mamma in my new Bugatti
She threw it back like my engine

You say no to ratchet pussy Trigga Trey Can’t
Plus I told them bitches do what Juicy J say
You ain’t spendin’ money then you niggas in the way
And the way she (Bounce) might just turn into a dinner plate
Broke niggas back off up
Weak bitches don’t talk to her
I ain’t never seen an ass that soft a brotha like fabric softener
But hold, up hold up, I ain’t tryna control her
Know what money talk and I told that bitch hey fuck you think that pole for
Do pussy tricks yo pussy spit in all her pussy lips
Money maker her go up
We see how wet that pussy get
See how wet the pussy get
When you bounce it, when you bounce it
