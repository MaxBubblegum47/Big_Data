Before I pick up the pace with some shit I'mma say
That's gon' ruffle some feathers but bitch, I can wait
I'm already broke, so what difference it make?
Well to tell you the truth, I don't listen to y'all
Cause the lyrics you spitting, them niggas is fake
I talk about shit that I did and I saw
Cause all of you niggas got bricks in the A
What is this shit now, the Wizard of Oz?
If you ain't no killer, don't get in the car
Trust me, you wouldn't wanna live in the walls
And if they get caught for the million they tossin'
They coming to get every nigga involved
Now you Michael Vick, thinkin' 'bout killing your dog
Told you, you should've just listened to me
And your mama is cool with his Mama?
I told you my nigga, this shit could get deep
You can't murder your foe, but for your freedom
Your heart'll get colder than 30 below
Say if you caught that case when you 20
You wouldn't get out till you 40 years old
Your alibi faded, I heard it before
All of your family is hurting and nervous
And cold that we're back to the verdict to show
That you were found guilty of murking your folk
It's hard to be a street nigga
God put me here to teach niggas
Who never graduated school
But they'll probably catch their first body in the first degree, nigga
Y'all glorified the trap
I don't know what's wrong with these niggas
Cause like Barry White's voice
This shit can get deep, nigga
