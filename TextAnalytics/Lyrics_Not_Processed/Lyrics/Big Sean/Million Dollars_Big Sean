[Hook]
Now I'm gon' make a million and one dollars and do it again
Just wait 'til tomorrow, we won't borrow ever again
I can't wait 'til the day we wake up, wake up, wake up
And we all gon' be paid up, paid up, paid up, just wait, wait

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm so tired of praying for this free shit
Man, being broke is some weak shit
But thank God for that Micky D's, one dollar double cheese
Or some nights, I wouldn't eat shit
When I was supposed to be asleep
I was in the studio like "Y'all, make some beats"
Man you can ask B Right, you can ask Earl Mac
You can ask Pat Piff
I didn't have to go to school, I was better at this
Wanna do a fight club, nigga call me Brad Pitt
Tryna get the whole world to know Sean
I'm the only thing getting better with time besides wine
So somebody gotta find me
Cause Sean be cranking hits like Bons B
Man I swear GOOD Music wanna sign me
Yeah right B, naw for real nigga

[Hook]
Now I'm gon' make a million and one dollars and do it again
Just wait 'til tomorrow, we won't borrow ever again
I can't wait 'til the day we wake up, wake up, wake up
And we all gon' be paid up, paid up, paid up, just wait, wait

[Outro]
Man, I can't give you all that man
Like I said, Finally Famous: The Album coming to y'all soon, man, G.O.O.D MUSIC
Right now I wanna get into an exclusive produced by my dawg 88 Keys
Man, featuring Mr Bentley

Finally Famous 2 (Full Song)

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm so tired of praying for this free shit
Man, being broke is some weak shit
But thank God for that Micky D's, one dollar double cheese
Or some nights, I wouldn't eat shit
But there always was girls on my penile
And I fell victim to the vaginal
But when it comes to the ass chase
No thank you, rather run in the cash race
'Till the world knows Sean
The only thing getter better in time besides wine
Honestly better than all these asses
With no practice, for real just as is
I didn't have to go to school, I was better at this
Watch a nigga pull more strings than Lenny Kravitz
So I can say I have it, iff not I wish I had it
I do it with a passion

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
And we just started, we ain't nowhere near the outro
I'll tell y'all what I'm about though
High ends, high spendin'
We just tryin' to end life on a high note, Soprano
And I was supposed to be on for a minute
Man I've been writin' songs for a minute
And you can ask Kanye, you can ask G-Ro, you can ask Don C
Hip-hop where the hell you find a nigga like me
Snotty nose lil' nigga, used to tear up ice cream
Now I'm wearin' Ice Cream with a chain on my shirt
Call that bitch an Ice-T
So tell me what it takes to go from sittin' on porches
To sittin' in Porsches, take in less fortunate
And turn it into a fortune
And make my mama proud that she didn't get that abortion

[Refrain]

[Outro x5]
I'm gone make a million, just wait 'till tomorrow, I'm gon' make a million
Do it again, we gone do it again, do it again
