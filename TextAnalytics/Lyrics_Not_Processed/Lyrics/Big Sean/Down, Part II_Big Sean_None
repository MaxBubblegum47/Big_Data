[Verse 1: Samantha Gongol]
Didn't even really wanna go
But if you get me out, you get a show
There's so many bodies on the floor
So baby we should go and add some more
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Everywhere I look are peoples' hands
Thrown up in the air to help them dance
Come on, baby, catch me if you can
I know you don't have any other plans
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?

[Hook: Samantha Gongol]
Are you... down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-d-d-down, are you Down, are you down, are you d-d-down, are you?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, down, d-d-d-down?

(Are you?)
(Oh, yeah yeah)
(Are you?)
Four AM text, I reply every time
Tryna get it in like I'm about to miss the deadline
We connect time, and we connect minds
And you tell me what I need to hear to reset mine
And I make you feel the way down to the electron
I get you there quicker than the pre-check line
Let's find time for lost times
You lose your cell phone, I toss mine
Give it time, let it breathe
Good God, but for you I do the felonies
And if you never test me, I never cheat
I've got enough faith to be faithful to you
And if you're not around I still stay there for you
I'm sitting, thinking if you're thinking about me thinking of you
I fuck you to sleep and come in your dreams
You wake up, I'm the first thing you see
Down

[Hook: Samantha Gongol]
Are you... down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
