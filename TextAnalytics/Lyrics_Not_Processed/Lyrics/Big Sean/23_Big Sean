[Intro]
Uh

[Chorus]
Man, verse by verse
I'ma make these weak niggas disperse (Weak nigga)
Man, I swear, verse by verse
I’ma make these weak rappers disperse (Weak nigga)
Man, I'ma get 'em, I’ma get 'em (Ayy)
Watch me get 'em, I'ma get 'em (Ayy)
I'ma get 'em, I'ma get ’em (Ayy)
Watch me get ’em, I'ma get ’em

[Verse]
I'm very instrumental, to any instrumental (Yeah)
You ain't on my level, my nigga, not even a little (Uh, uh)
You at the bottom, not even at Malcolm in the Middle (Yeah)
You homo ass nigga, go and eat some Skittles (Haha)
Now hop up on the rainbow, try to reach where I am though
I'm a little further up, damn I’m near the angels
So at your highest point, you still wouldn't reach my ankles
You are what you eat, well that ain't true, 'cause I'm anal (Ooh)
And the people show love like a bear hug
I'm here to last, they temporary, call them handcuffs
Fair enough, I stand behind my bars like a felon does (Ayy)
If you a boss, meet the executive (Yeah)
And when it come to paper, meet the editor (Uh)
A little better, bruh, you need to step, step it up
I'm on my business, that's my forte (Word)
You, you beat around the bush like foreplay (Huh)
And they anticipated me like the court date (Huh)
So for the bars, I'm in charge like the courts say
And if the courts say they know, I did it like OJ (What)
And I'm in the next city like a tour day
Ain't no "I" in team, but there's an "I" in win
Ain't no "I" in lose, but there's an "I" in him
Meaning me (Me), meaning moi (Moi)
Peep the repertoire, up the upper echelon
That's high, high in the sky
High to the point that I almost saw God (Wow)
Wow, I stand out from the rest of the crowd like yeah
But ain't got to play ball to hear your cheer in the crowd
Perform so well, I might as well take a bow
Shitting on these niggas, like a movement from my bowels
People want to know how it feels in the clouds
But I guess they'll never know, 'cause I'm never coming down
I started with a dream, added a little faith
And mixed it with adversity and let it marinate
I put it in the oven for a while, let it bake (Yeah)
Call it food for thought, put it on your plate (Eat)
I'm from the mighty Motown, home sweet home
Where I roam like a phone, in an unknown zone
My niggas roam like a phone in an unknown zone
And we could not atone, the money, clothes, and hoes
And my rep is sell like a boatload
Fam', you couldn't fill my shoes like bozos
And I'm so low
Because I heard what hoes really want, a ring like Frodo (No)
Coastal, made my nickname postal
Why they local like they old schools
Man, I should beat 'em like ProTools
Will Ferrell, nigga started out old school

[Chorus]
Man, verse by verse
I'ma make these weak niggas disperse (Weak nigga)
Man, I swear, verse by verse
I'ma make these weak rappers disperse (Weak nigga)
Man, I'ma get 'em, I'ma get 'em (Ayy)
Watch me get 'em, I'ma get 'em (Ayy)
I'ma get 'em, I'ma get 'em (Ayy)
Watch me get 'em, I'ma get 'em

[Outro]
Note to world, I made it
I promise I'ma change it
Thank god to my mama that I'm 
Finally Famous
Famous, famous, famous
