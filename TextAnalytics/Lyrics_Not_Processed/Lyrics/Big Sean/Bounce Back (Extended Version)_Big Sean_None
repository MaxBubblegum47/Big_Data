[Intro: Future]
If Young Metro don't trust you I'ma shoot you

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the damn job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me cause I’m homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that chick off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be s-shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
How dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything expect worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
They change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Look I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Look I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Yeah fuck what you know
Look I’m takin' back control
The under dog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Aaliyah taught me that if first you don’t succeed
To try again and bounce back
The harder you hit the ground
The higher you bounce
Facts, it’s physics
So many problems systematically we call it the system
Drug dealers and drug users, they both get a sentence
Do the time now every job interview cut to two minutes
Even if you overqualified
Living in a cardboard box
They go bounce you right back in it
Got me wondering what politicians do we got politicking
It concern me
Presidential debates is sounding too personal
My bro reached over like
Man damn what happened to Bernie
I guess primaries wasn’t his primary to get it in
Come November lets see if it happen again
I decided that counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon
I decided for the first time in my life, no second guessing
I decided in this moment in time right now who the best is
I’m the best
