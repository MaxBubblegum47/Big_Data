[Intro: Nas]
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs

[Chorus: Big Sean & James Fauntleroy]
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Top floor, only way that we go
Diamonds and gold, Sierra Leone, Leone
Hotel look like Sierra Leone, Leone
Chain, ring look like Sierra Leone, Leone
And she don't ever tell me I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Cause she don't want to leave Sierra Leone, Leone

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Get to it, I be getting to it
Hella groovin', rooftop, better viewin'
Always hella coppin', no propellers, 
moving bank tellers
Movin', youngin', revenuin', mozzarella chewin', you know?
Lobster butter basted
I deserve every crumb tasted, road to riches one way and
Sunbathing, tongue tastin'
After that she wine tasting, Sean tastin'
You know? I gave her diamonds and gold
That's Sierra Leone, her friends like "Girl don't let go!"
So she ain't askin', she ain't whinin'
Complainin' or trippin', man I got her damn near strippin'
For the handbag livin', Saks Fifth'n, tag rippin'
No more tab splittin', cab gettin', who wants to go back to that livin'? Do yah?
So let's sex on the beach
Then the rest on the sheets for the rest of the week, 'til

[Chorus: Big Sean & James Fauntleroy]
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Top floor, only way that we go
Diamonds and gold, Sierra Leone, Leone
Hotel look like Sierra Leone, Leone
Chain, ring look like Sierra Leone, Leone
And she don't ever tell me I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Cause she don't want to leave Sierra Leone, Leone

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
What you know about wake up to fuckin' 'fore you even can stretch?
Yeah I'm on vacay and my dick still need a rest
I might get her on film, star and direct
Just might win an award if that shit hit the net
Oh, reclinin' in seats
Not liftin' a finger 'less I'm signin' receipts
Livin' life like I got a degree
Fuck it, I'm livin' life like I done got in the league
Look, my car look like it play for the Lakers
Credit card look like it play for the Raiders
I watch it play for the paper
Chandelier, marble floor on the feet
She said I'm a don, I gotta agree, I fuck her to sleep

[Chorus: Big Sean & James Fauntleroy]
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Top floor, only way that we go
Diamonds and gold, Sierra Leone, Leone
Hotel look like Sierra Leone, Leone
Chain, ring look like Sierra Leone, Leone
And she don't ever tell me I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Cause she don't want to leave Sierra Leone, Leone

[Greedy Ho's Skit]
Big Sean: I gotta take a shower, you so goddamn nasty, baby
*someone knocks at the door*
Big Sean: Hey, who is it?
His girl: Oh shit, it's just room service
Big Sean: Room service? Again?
His girl (to her friend): What about these rings? What are you looking for?
Big Sean: Hey can you grab me a towel?
Her friend: What about that phone?
*Big Sean singing*
His girl: Come on, lets get outta here
Big Sean: Yo! Yo! Hello? Bitch! What the fuck?
