Okay, now after you back it up then stop

Okay, now after you back it up then stop
Wha-wha-wha-wha drop it like it's hot

[Verse 1: wifisfuneral]
I know you just can't understand it, like how she have it
I guess that ass can turn to magic, ride it like Aladdin
Okay, ten toes, bouncin' on that dick like she can manage
Okay, like where the freak hoes
Like bounce that ass and make them motherfuckin' knees show
Hold up, 80 grand, 20 grand, all up in my hand
Damn please understand
Damn, ma'am, see I'm really 'bout these bands, how you came with all of that?
She gon' bust it from the front and I'm gon' catch it from the back
Molly got me crazy, I'm feeling upset, percs too lazy, can't focus
If she don't pay her bills today, she's upset
I'm gon' pay her rent today, you know this
Okay, I whip it out the lot same time I whip it out the pot
I threw up fifty bands I saw it fallin' from the sky
My ring is on a hunnid, VVS's on the watch
Okay these niggas steady hatin', yeah, they hard to rock

[Chorus: wifisfuneral]
Girl you workin' with some ass, yeah, you bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last check
Hoes ridin' like they mad, yeah, like fuck yeah
I'm a big time nigga, yeah, money flippa, yeah
Okay, get it like it's good, yeah, understood, yeah
Girl you workin' with some ass, yeah, you bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last check
Hoes ridin' like they mad, yeah, like fuck yeah

[Verse 2: YBN Nahmir]
AK-47, get sent to heaven
I can't fuck with no opp hoes, I learned my lesson
Let a nigga try to rob me and I'ma bless him
.30 clip up in that Ruger, nigga, keep a weapon
Lil' baby say she wanna fuck with me
She wanna fuck wit' a lil' nigga from them streets
And I'm a hot nigga, leave a nigga in them streets
That lil' tech hot, knock a nigga off his feet
I was like sixteen, totin' sixteen, just a young fly nigga with a big dream
These bitches they be on me say macaroni, ayy
Switch like Michael Jordan, shoot shots like Kobe
Bitches started hatin' since I'm gettin' the bag
Still keep a Uzi on my lap and True's on my ass
All these bitches they be freaks and they be shakin' that ass
Had to run my money up and show her that I'm the man

[Chorus: wifisfuneral]
Girl you workin' with some ass, yeah, you bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last check
Hoes ridin' like they mad, yeah, like fuck yeah
I'm a big time nigga, yeah, money flippa, yeah
Okay, get it like it's good, yeah, understood, yeah
Girl you workin' with some ass, yeah, you bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last check
Hoes ridin' like they mad, yeah, like fuck yeah
