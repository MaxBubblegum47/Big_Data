[Verse 1]
I don’t even know you, baby
But I want to, girl, I want you, oh
My body’s got me acting crazy
I got 99 problems and they’re all you
, oh
Baby, let me take you on a ride
I want to take a fast track to your heart
I think you know where I’d like to start
I can tell there's something’s on your mind
Tell me what you wanna do
All I got is bad intentions

[Chorus]
Baby, you fill me up
Right up, with bad intentions, intentions
Baby, I’m so caught up
In love with bad intentions, intentions

[Verse 2]
I want to see under, under your cover
Let me read your body language
I wanna know you, oh, yeah
Let me see it all in colour
Your love gets sweeter
Every chapter, every page
Baby, let me read between the lines
Where you are my escape
I can get lost in your mind for days, oh
Let’s just spend some time
I know what you wanna do
You’re filling me with bad intentions

[Chorus]
Baby, you fill me up
Right up, with bad intentions, intentions
Baby, I’m so caught up
In love with bad intentions, intentions

[Bridge]
Don’t need all your love, don’t need your love
Your body is enough to set the mood, oh, yeah
Satisfy my lust, I promise when we touch
You’ll feel it too, baby, you’ll feel it too

[Chorus]
Baby, you fill me up
Right up, with bad intentions, intentions
Baby, I’m so caught up
In love with bad intentions, intentions

[Outro]
I won’t fall in love with you
We can fool around and keep it cool
I won’t fall in love with you
We can fool around and keep it cool
Fast tract to your heart
I won’t fall in love with you
We can fool around and keep it cool
I won’t fall in love with you
We can fool around and keep it cool
