[Intro]
I can't lie, I can't, I can't lie to you
I can't lie, I can't, I can't lie to you

[Verse 1]
Even though I wasn't caught red handed
I wasn't sleeping with the lie
So I gave myself up, I couldn't stand it
It was fucking with my pride

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I confessed it all to you
I know there ain't no easy way
And now you know the truth
So please don't take your love away from me
Even though I did you wrong

[Chorus]
At least I never lied to you (Oh, baby)
I will never lie to you (I admit I was wrong)
I admit that what I did was heartless
At least I'm being honest
I can't lie to you, I can't lie to you

[Post-Chorus]
I can't lie, I can't, I can't lie to you
I can't lie, I can't, I can't lie to you

[Verse 2]
No need to look in my phone, there ain't no evidence
All the dirty details are irrelevant
She wasn't worth one night, you're worth my life
That's why it's fucking with my pride

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I confessed it all to you
I know there ain't no easy way
And now you know the truth
So please don't take your love away from me
Even though I did you wrong

[Chorus]
At least I never lied to you (Oh, baby)
I will never lie to you (I admit I was wrong)
I admit that what I did was heartless
At least I'm being honest
I can't lie to you, I can't lie to you

[Post-Chorus]
I can't lie, I can't, I can't lie to you
I can't lie, I can't, I can't lie to you

[Bridge]
Baby, I just want to talk to you
Phone's died, spent all my time calling you
I can't do more than apologize
So tell me what to, what to do

[Chorus]
At least I never lied to you (Oh, I would never, never)
I will never lie to you (I admit I was wrong)
I admit that what I did was heartless
At least I'm being honest
I can't lie to you, I can't lie to you

[Post-Chorus]
I can't lie, I can't, I can't lie to you
I can't lie, I can't, I can't lie to you
I can't lie to you
I can't lie, I can't, I can't lie to you
I can't lie, I can't, I can't lie to you
I can't lie to you
