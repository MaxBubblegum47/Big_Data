[Verse 1: Kaine]
When your body's keeping me warm
How could I ever forget?
Out of everybody, it's you that I want
I just need you to know
When we turn the water into wine
Can you promise me you'll still be mine?
I just need you in my life, woah

[Pre-Chorus: Ben & 
Delleile
]
I give you time over money
Get money over time
You don't have to worry
It's you that's on my mind
I'll still want you when I'm in my

[Chorus: Delleile & 
All
]
When I'm in my tuxedo
When I'm in my
When I'm in my
When I'm in my tuxedo
When I'm in my
When I'm in my
'Cause I want you, forget the ego
When I'm in my
When I'm in my
Time or my money
Because I'll still want you
When I'm in my

[Verse 2: 
All
, Akia, 
Kaine
 & (Michael & Ben)]
Girl, we're gonna see
Diamonds, silver and gold
Now that I'm on my way
We'll be travelling
First-class all over the globe
(So good that it'll take your breath away)

[Pre-Chorus: Ben & 
Delleile
]
I give you time or my money
Get money or my time
You don't have to worry
It's you that's on my mind
'Cause I still want you when I'm in my

[Chorus: Delleile & 
All
]
When I'm in my tuxedo
When I'm in my
When I'm in my
When I'm in my tuxedo
When I'm in my
When I'm in my
Because I want you, forget the ego
When I'm in my
When I'm in my
Time or my money
I'll still want you
When I'm in my

[Bridge: Ben, 
Akia
 & 
All
]
Fancy cars or flashing lights
Are not the first thing on my mind
It won't mean a thing
Without you by my side
When everything is changing
We'll stay the same
And I won't let you go
I'll still want you
When I'm in my
When I'm in my
I'll still want you, yeah
When I'm in my

[Chorus: Delleile & 
All
]
When I'm in my tuxedo
When I'm in my
When I'm in my
When I'm in my
When I'm in my
'Cause I want you, forget the ego
When I'm in my
When I'm in my
I'll still want you
When I'm in my
When I'm in my tuxedo

[Outro: All & 
Delleile
]
Baby, you've been with me from the start
Baby, you've been with me from the start
When I'm in my tuxedo
Baby, you've been with me from the start
When I'm in my tuxedo
Want you, forget the ego
Baby, you've been with me from the start
I'll still want you, when I'm in my
When I'm in my tuxedo
I'll give you, I'll give you
Time or my money
I'll give you, I'll give you
