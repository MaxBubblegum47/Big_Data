[Verse 1: Kaine]
Turn the lights off for me
Hard to hear, hard to see
Oh Lord
Not afraid of the trip
In a pool filled with sin
Oh Lord, oh Lord

[Pre-Chorus: Michael, Delleile & Kaine]
He said don't you run from me while I take it off
Take it off, take it off
Tell me your name while I break you off
Break you off, while I break you off
Don't you run from me while I take it off
Take it off, take it off
Tell me your name while I break you off
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord

[Chorus: Delleile]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
When the rhythm hits, I'm not afraid to die
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord
Oh lord, oh lord
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord
There's just way too many temptations

[Verse 2: Ben & All]
Feel my pulse as I breathe at 103
Oh Lord, oh Lord
I'm not afraid of the trip
In a pool filled with sin

[Pre-Chorus: Michael, Delleile & Kaine]
He said don't you run from me while I take it off
Take it off, take it off
Tell me your name while I break you off
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord

[Chorus: Delleile & All]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Feel it coming, feel it coming
When the rhythm hits, I'm not afraid to die
Feel it coming
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord
Oh lord, oh lord
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord

[Bridge: Ben & Kaine]
Don't you run from me, no no, no no
Don't you run from me
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord

[Chorus: Delleile & All]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Feel it coming, feel it coming
When the rhythm hits, I'm not afraid to die
Feel it coming
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord
Oh lord, oh lord
Way too many temptations, oh Lord
Oh lord, oh lord
There's just way too many temptations, oh Lord
