[Verse 1: Ben & Kaine]
I'm blaming this heart of mine
Not like I changed my mind
Nothing you've done, it's all on me
I'm blaming this heart of mine
'Cause I been going back and forth
Should I stay or should I hit the road?
'Cause the thought of leaving you alone
Oh, it kills me

[Chorus: All & Delleile]
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
All the memories we made
What am I to do with this heart of yours?
Don't wanna throw it away
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
Heart of yours, heart of yours
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
It's so easy to break
Tell me what to do with your heart

[Verse 2: Michael & Delleile]
No matter how hard I try
Something just won't unlift my mind
Like the time that we were making love
In your house when your parents caught us
It kills me to let you go
Oh, baby

[Chorus: All & Delleile]
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
All the memories we made
What am I to do with this heart of yours?
Don't wanna throw it away
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
Heart of yours, heart of yours
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
It's so easy to break
Tell me what to do with your heart

[Bridge: Akia & All & Kaine]
You gave me your heart so I know you're strong
You will get over me
Know you will get over me
So over me
Know you will get over me
I know that it's hard but it won't be long
You will get over me
Know you will get over me
So over me
Know you will get over me
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours, heart
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours, heart, woah

[Chorus: All & Delleile]
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
All the memories we made
What am I to do with this heart of yours?
Don't wanna throw it away
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
Heart of yours, heart of yours
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
It's so easy to break
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
All the memories we made
What am I to do with this heart of yours?
Don't wanna throw it away
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
Heart of yours, heart of yours
Tell me what to do with this heart of yours
It's so easy to break

[Outro: All]
Hope that I won't regret it
I won't let it go
Hope that I won't regret it
I won't let it go
Hope that I won't regret it
I won't let it go
Hope that I won't regret it
I won't let it go
