[Intro]
Your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back

[Verse 1]
I didn't come here to party
In one touch, you got me
You went straight to my head, cocky
Everything that you said got me
I'm not that into drinking
But with you, I'm sinking
You went straight to my head, faded
Every sip that I get

[Pre-Chorus]
Came for a fight, I let you in
Under my skin
You changed my mind and I give in
And it's always the same

[Chorus]
You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back
You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back
Your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back
Your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back

[Verse 2]
Like I'm on pills and potions
You took the moment
Put it down cause you know you want it
Got inside of my head, you stole it
Riding on automatic
And I get so distracted
All I hear is your body talking
Every sip that I get

[Pre-Chorus]
Came for a fight, I let you in
Under my skin
You changed my mind and I give in
And it's always the same

[Chorus]
You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back
You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back
Your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back
Your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back

[Bridge]
Make you my focus
No interruptions
Run out of options
I just gotta make you mine
I just gotta make you
Gotta keep you coming right back

[Chorus]
You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back
You make me call your name
Now I gotta have one more taste
One shot of your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back
Your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back
Your whiskey kisses hot on my lips
I keep coming right back
