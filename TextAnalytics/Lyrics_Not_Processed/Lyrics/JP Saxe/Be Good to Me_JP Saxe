[Pre-Chorus: Jacob Banks]
Oh, please be good to me
Oh save my soul and lead me home
I've been running for far too long
Oh, please be good to me

[Chorus: Jacob Banks]
Be good to me, be good to me
Be good to me, be good to me

[Verse 1: Jacob Banks]
My hands are sore carrying promises
Another war that I’ve lost
My time is yours, waste it carefully
You hit and run, do it gracefully

[Pre-Chorus: Jacob Banks]
Oh, please be good to me
Oh save my soul and lead me home
I've been running for far too long
Oh, please be good to me

[Chorus: Jacob Banks]
Be good to me, be good to me
Be good to me, be good to me
Be good to me, be good to me
Be good to me, be good to me

[Verse 2: Seinabo Sey]
My stupid heart is always a casualty
It wants to be loved, it hates the vacancy
My time is yours, waste it carefully
If you hit and run, do it gracefully

[Pre-Chorus: Seinabo Sey]
Oh, please be good to me
Oh save my soul and lead me home
I've been running for far too long
Oh, please be good to me

[Chorus: Jacob Banks & Seinabo Sey]
Be good to me, be good to me
Be good to me, be good to me
Be good to me, be good to me
Be good to me, be good to me
Woah, woah
Be good to me

[Bridge: Jacob Banks]
Oh Oh
Be good to me
It’s all I'm asking from you
You know I'm counting on you
To lead me to nirvana
Be good to me
It's all I'm asking from you
You know I'm counting on you
Be good to me
Be good to me

[Chorus: Jacob Banks]
Be good to me, be good to me
Be good to me, be good to me
Be good to me, be good to me
Be good to me, be good to me
