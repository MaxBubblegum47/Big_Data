[Verse 1]
I thought you woulda called yesterday
I said I didn't want you to, but I still thought you would
I don't know what I expected you to say
But I turned 25 and had in my mind
You'd be part of that in some way

[Chorus]
I'm halfway 'round the world with all these people
Happy in a foreign language
Where they don't know a thing about you
I'm halfway 'round the world in Barcelona
Trying not to think you'd love this
This wasn't supposed to be about you
This wasn't supposed to be about you

[Verse 2]
I wonder how I crossed your mind
I'm sure I did, but I'm curious what the thought of me felt like
Was it harder that you imagined it would be?
'Cause when I missed your 30th, it almost fucking killed me

[Chorus]
I'm halfway 'round the world with all these people
Happy in a foreign language
Where they don't know a thing about you
I'm halfway 'round the world in Barcelona
Singing songs to you for strangers
And trying not to think about you
This wasn't supposed to be about you
This wasn't supposed to be about you

[Bridge]
Mmm
Mmm

[Chorus]
I'm halfway 'round the world with all these people
Happy in a foreign language
Where they don't know a thing about you
I'm halfway 'round the world in Barcelona
Tryna feel my world expanding
Like none of it was built around you
This wasn't supposed to be about you
This wasn't supposed to be about you

[Outro]
Mmm
Mmm
