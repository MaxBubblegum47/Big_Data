[Verse 1]
Are you on this side of town?
Could you be beside me right now?
You could ask me that anywhere, I'd say, "Be there soon"
Love don't get better than you
I stood for a breath at your door
Just to let it sink in a bit more
However you held me that night, I just knew
Love don't get better than you

[Chorus]
And I still don't know what you've done to me
I'm just a sad corny fuck suddenly
I still don't know what you've done to me
Oh
Oh

[Verse 2]
I was naive in your arms
I was naive from the start
I felt it back then, can't you tell I still do?
Love don't get better than you
And I know I held on for too long
Somehow that never felt wrong
But now that you're gone, I'm just scared it's still true
Love don't get better than you

[Chorus]
And I still don't know what you've done to me
I'm just a sad corny fuck suddenly
I still don't know what you've done to me
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

[Verse 3]
I keep your love notes in a drawer
I know you don't feel that way anymore
It just feels nice knowing you really used to
Love don't get better than you
And I know it'll just take more time
If I don't let the memories die
But in every girl's eyes, I just find some more proof
Love don't get better than you
