[Verse 1]
I get insecure for stupid reasons
I tell myself I shouldn't but I feel it
And you get kinda stubborn when you're wrong
You're just kinda stubborn overall
I don't intend on holdin' it against you
I understand what comes from what we've been through
Like I'm afraid you won't meet me halfway
And you're afraid I won't know how to stay

[Refrain]
I think we got used to love that put us second
We both know way too much about each other's exes
It really should've been us all along

[Chorus]
But you got a lot of great songs 'bout a lot of shit guys
You did more with three minutes than they'll do with their lives
And we'll buy ourselves houses with our heartbreak songs
Fuck everybody else who ever treated us wrong
Got a lot of great songs 'bout a lot of shit guys
You did more with three minutes than they'll do with their lives
And we'll buy ourselves houses with our heartbreak songs
Fuck everybody else who ever treated us wrong

[Verse 2]
You get really quiet when we're fighting
I talk too much and neither of us like it
But I just wanna fix it right away
And you're scared of regretting what you'd say
But maybe when we've been together long enough
We'll have shaken off the habits of a different love
And forgotten everything we always thought it was
Thank God it's us

[Chorus]
But you got a lot of great songs 'bout a lot of shit guys
You did more with three minutes than they'll do with their lives
And we'll buy ourselves houses with our heartbreak songs
Fuck everybody else who ever treated us wrong
Got a lot of great songs 'bout a lot of shit guys
You did more with three minutes than they'll do with their lives
And we'll buy ourselves houses with our heartbreak songs
Fuck everybody else who ever treated us wrong

[Post-Chorus]
Fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all

[Refrain]
I think we got used to love that put us second
We both know way too much about each other's exes
It really should've been us all along

[Chorus]
But you got a lot of great songs 'bout a lot of shit guys
You did more with three minutes than they'll do with their lives
And we'll buy ourselves houses with our heartbreak songs
Fuck everybody else who ever treated us wrong
Tryna make you feel loved and I hope it's successful
'Cause a bad song about you would feel disrespectful
How about you always fall asleep in my arms?
Fuck everybody else who ever treated us wrong

[Outro]
Fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all
