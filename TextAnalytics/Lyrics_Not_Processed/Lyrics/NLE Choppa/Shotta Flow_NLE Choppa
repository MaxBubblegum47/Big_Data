[Intro]
I wish everything I touch would turn to gold
NLE, you heard me?
Baby Mexico Choppa, man, Top Shotta
Baby Mexico Shotta, you heard me?
We finna talk our shit, you heard me?
YNR (Yeah)
Midas got a jugg, ayy
 (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I am a menace, keep me a rack just like tennis
I'm with the shit like I'm Dennis
I started this shit, I'ma finish
Niggas be hatin', tryna blemish my image
Who want the smoke? .223 came with the scope
Extended clip long as a rope
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
I knew that boy was a ho
Pull up with the gang, you know that we bangin'
What is your set, nigga? What is you claimin'?
I am a beast, you cannot tame it
Don't point a finger, this shit can get dangerous
These niggas hatin', these niggas plottin'
Ooh, he got money, I'm runnin' his wallet
You say you a killer, lil' nigga, stop it
In a shootout, your gun was droppin'
You really a fraud, you cannot stomp on this yard
My niggas, they scammin', they swipin' them cards
I am so high that I'm talkin' to stars
I'm gone off them jiggas, I'm poppin' them bars
Don't mind my pimpin', bitch, don't sweat me
Chopper got a kick, call that shit Jet Li
Sauce Gang dripped up, what is your recipe?
Gon' get an F if a nigga try testin' me
Whole lotta money, whole lotta guala
Hit the party fifty deep, nothin' but my shottas
Nigga tried me so you know I had to pop him
So many bullets, it confused the doctor
Whole lotta racks, whole lotta stacks
Fuck a headshot, I'ma shoot him in the back
Three-point-five rolled up in the Cack'
We don't smoke reggie, this shit called gas
I'm sticked up like a blind man
I'm super hot like a frying pan
He say that he gon' take somethin' from me
Ayy, just know, he lyin', man
I'ma up from my hip then blow like a whistle
Your bitch suckin' dick like a Kool-Aid pickle
Two bullets in your chest, that's a nipple
And if a nigga run up, I'ma pop him like a pimple
Get rich or die tryin', I'm feelin' like 50
Brand new chopper got double-D titties
Nigga, don't play me, I don't get silly
Love all the beef like a Southwest Philly, yeah

[Interlude]
Yeah, love all the beef like a Southwest Philly, yeah, ayy
Bet, love all the beef like a Southwest Philly

[Verse 2]
I might just OD, Percs killin' me slowly
Feelin' like I'm Kobe, can't nan' nigga hold me
If he wanna run up on me, shoot him like Ginobili
And I'm with the shit, lil' homie, yeah, like I'm Toby (Yeah)
And I'm with the shit, lil' homie, yeah, like I'm Toby, bitch (Yeah)

[Outro]
Finna ad-lib, keep all that (Like I'm Toby, yeah, yeah)

Keep all that, Tay, yeah (This shit straight drop, lil' nigga, no cut)
Ayy, Tay, keep all that, keep all that (Straight drop, lil' nigga, no cut)
Yeah, yeah
(Up from my hip, yeah)
