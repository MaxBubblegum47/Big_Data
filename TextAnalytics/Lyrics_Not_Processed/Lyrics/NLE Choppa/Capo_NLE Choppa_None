[Intro]
Yeah, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hahaha
I ain't doin' no playing Jack, you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, hrrroww
Bow, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm tired of him breathing, I'm taking his breath (Huh?)
Shoot to my right, my flag on the left
I earned my stripes but I'm not a ref
These niggas, they woke, they overslept (Yeah)
My bitch, she clutch because she a nurse
Whenever I'm down she give me a perc
The police pull up, my gun in her purse
The ops pull up, put him on a shirt
Bitch, we came in this world and we lookin' for murder
Knock yo cap off and it's word to Bobby Shmurda
Nigga watch yo mouth, I would hate to have to hurt ya
You would kill off a perc but snitch when you sober
Man down in the street, man, this nigga tried to play me
I hit one in the head but his gun was on safety
They askin' how I been, what I been feelin' lately
I got good aim in the pocket like I'm Brady

[Verse 1]
Can't speak on the shit I did to you
To be honest, them bullets wasn't meant for you
I'm sorry that they hit you
Fuck that, spin again, shoot the friend too
See at first I was gon' stop and chill
Hell nah, how them hollows feel?
I'm independent, can't sign a deal
Won't sell out for a couple mill
Before you try and rob, hit yo knees and pray to Buddha
Soon as you up it, Lil Trey gonna shoot ya
Remember I was young and I used to be a hoopa
I got into guns then I turned to the shoota
Knock off yo head, call that a fuckin' train wreck
Bitch, close yo legs, Where the fuck is yo brain at?
Wet a nigga block, make it look like we painted
Man I used to struggle, now a nigga famous

[Verse 2]
I'm 16, with big dreams, I wanna be a star
I used to spend money on lil things, now I want a car
Aye, that Rollie or that Audemars, Where do I start?
Man this lean fuckin' up my tummy, makin' me fart
Hunnid-sumthn shots in the rental
My bitch, she bad, like Kendall
I'm poppin' niggas like pimple
I'm in her mouth, that's dental
We strapped up like a gay ho
We kill niggas like Tadoe
We ruthless like Fredo and love totin' Dracos
Mop a nigga with the .40, I'm a janitor
We smokin' on gas, that's cannabis
That's a lot in the Draco, I'm a animal
In Florida, chillin' in Panama
He said he want smoke, I hope that he ready
I put on my mask like Jason and Freddy
You soft as a bear, just like Teddy
I shoot him in the head, knock out his spaghetti (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm tired of him breathing, I'm taking his breath (Huh?)
Shoot to my right, my flag on the left
I earned my stripes but I'm not a ref
These niggas, they woke, they overslept (Yeah)
My bitch, she clutch because she a nurse
Whenever I'm down she give me a perc
The police pull up, my gun in her purse
The opps pull up, put him on a shirt
Bitch, we came in this world and we lookin' for murder
Knock yo cap off and it's word to Bobby Shmurda
Nigga watch yo mouth, I would hate to have to hurt ya
You would kill off a perc but snitch when you sober
Man down in the street, man, this nigga tried to play me
I hit one in the head but his gun was on safety
They askin' how I been, what I been feelin' lately
I got good aim in the pocket like I'm Brady
