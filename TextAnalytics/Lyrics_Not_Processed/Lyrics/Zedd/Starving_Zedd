[Verse 1]
You know just what to say, things that scare me
I should just walk away, but I can't move my feet
The more that I know you, the more I want to

[Pre-Chorus]
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, oh

[Chorus]
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you

[Verse 2]
You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak in my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, yeah
So much younger yesterday, oh

[Chorus]
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you

[Bridge]
You you, yeah 'til I tasted you
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you
I didn't know 'til I tasted you

[Pre-Chorus]
The more that I know you, the more that I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday
