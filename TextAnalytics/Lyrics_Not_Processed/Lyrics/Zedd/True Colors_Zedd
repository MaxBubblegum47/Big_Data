[Verse 1: Tim James]
Stars fall at my feet, keep me grounded as I reach
Higher than I see, is there something there for me?
Pulling back the reins, letting go again
I'm not afraid, I'm not

[Chorus: Tim James]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
No no no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors
It ain't no rainbow

[Verse 2: Tim James]
A promise with a lie is broken by design
What I thought I knew
Has been swallowed by the truth
It's time to light the flame
Right before it rains
I'm not afraid, I'm not

[Chorus: Tim James]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
No no no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't no rainbow

[Bridge: Tim James]
Something tells me I know nothing at all
We've escaped our capture
Yet we have our masters
And somehow it's like I've waited

[Chorus: Tim James]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
And no, and no I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my
My true colors, it ain't no rainbow
