[Intro: Jaden]
Don't tell me you cried cause I know that you didn't
Don't tell me you love me, I know I'm just trippin'
Cause you tore down my ego, and I listened
Why did I... listen?
Don't tell me you cried cause I know that you didn't
Don't tell me you love me, I know I'm just trippin'
Cause you tore down my ego, and I listened
Why did I... listen?

[Verse 1: Jaden]
Man I met a girl at Coachella
I like her but you know I couldn't tell her
Cause she had her own fella and I met a blow dealer
He told me that he was a wholesaler and I'm fly as propellers
Man it's rainin' umbrellas
Tati went to go and find Stella
Teo went to get Bella, now we waitin' in the cellar
I hope your man doesn't get jealous
Cause I grabbed your hand in a blur
I saw that he's insecure, he's the one with the MSFTS shirt
With the eyes
And your eyes are lookin' at me with such a deep surprise
Baby girl I can see under all them lies
I can see under all them lies
(She's gonna try to kiss you, Jaden)
Well I'll suffocate if she tries
And I'll hold her tight if she cries
Man I met a girl at Coachella
I like her but you know I couldn't tell her
Cause she has her own fella but I met a blow dealer
He told me that he was a wholesaler and I'm fly as propellers
Man it's rainin' umbrellas
Tati went to go and find Stella
Teo went to get Bella, now we waitin' in the cellar

[Refrain: Jaden]
I hope your man doesn't get jealous
I hope your man doesn't get jealous
I hope your man doesn't get jealous
I hope your man doesn't get jealous
I hope your man doesn't get jealous

[Bridge: Willow & Jaden]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat, Iâ€™ll go
To the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean...

[Interlude: Jaden/Willow]
Don't tell the police, don't tell the police
I fell in the crease of reality and blood on my fleece
My head is in peace, says look at the height that we reached
We're like some whales but we should tan on a beach
Well that sounds awesome to me
Magnetics, the magnetics
(I hate myself for hurting you)
(But I love you, and you know that)
(I don't need to explain myself)
The secret Halloween
(They know this)
I'll dream of you
(Jaden, Jaden, Jaden, so many times)
You'll dream of me too
(Jaden, Jaden, Jaden, and dream of him)
Your hands there on my face
(Jaden, Jaden, Jaden)
There will be no better place

[Verse 2: Jaden]
I know it's not my place to say I love you, but who's it up to?
Alice went down the hole an hour ago and she's in trouble
I should be down on the double, hurry up homies let's huddle
How do you manage being so humble and try not to fumble
And stumble and stumble and stumble
Ricki-ticki and tumble
Like we was in college, I'm sorry, I'ma be with them bumble of bees
It's cold, so baby we should probably cuddle
Put your arms in a bundle, my lips on your neck but it's subtle
Your father won't notice, he's way too busy yellin' at coaches
That college football got him wrapped up, bet it all on the Trojans
I wrote you some notes, they're atrocious
Hope that you don't expose us
Man your love is my narcotic and I double my dosage
I needed a mother figure and girl I guess you're the closest
Girl your body's my ocean, head lay on your chest when I wrote this
And I told you they'd kill us and girl the way that you choked
Was just so emotional that I wish that my mouth never opened
And girl I hope you know that no society or a cult
Can take me away from you, you're the orange juice to my pulp
And girl I'ma say to you, I just wanna grope and elope
But I stay away from you, cause everybody knows I'm a ghost
But I can still dream
I can still dream, I can still...
I can still dream, I can...
I can still dream, I can still dream
As long as I can dream... As long as I dream
