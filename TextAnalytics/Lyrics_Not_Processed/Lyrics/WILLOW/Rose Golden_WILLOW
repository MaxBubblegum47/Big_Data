[Intro]
Two, three, four
Ohhh-oh-ohh

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Willow Smith]
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of the Chosen
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of The Chosen

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, hey
Hmm, hmm, na-na-na-na-na-nah
The story of The Chosen, Rose Golden
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi & Willow Smith]
Looking where we're at
How did we make it through this level all in one piece?
Hmm, oh, oh
Oh, where them friends now? I don't see 'em
And if I do, I don't sense the truth in 'em
Distancing myself while I'm focusing, fo-focusing
Don't pretend to worry bout shit
Go through one ear and out the other
Better off saying nothing, nigga
As I shine on and dream on, our vibes are on
Had one trip of a dream back in 2003
Who am I? And who will I be? Will I be free?
I need a sign, oh I need a sign

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Willow Smith]
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of The Chosen

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, hey
Hmm, hey, na-na-na-na-na-na
The story of The Chosen, Rose Golden
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi & (Willow Smith)]
Look at who you are, how could it be?
All I ever wanted was to find some inner peace
Mmm, oh, oh, oh
Where them haters now? I don't hear 'em
(They must be delusional) to think they fucking with me, though
I put that on my soul, can't love, they jealous, so jealous, and some
Learning day to day, humans
Spread love to all my sisters and brothers, let's do better
Stop judging a nigga because they're different
We're supposed to groove to our own tune
So woke from that one tripped out dream back in 2003
(Oh, who am I?)
And who do I see, baby?
The stars will align, the stars will align

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Willow Smith]
Oh, since I was young, been groovin' to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of The Chosen
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of The Chosen

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, hey
Hmm, hey, na-na-na-na-na-nah
The story of The Chosen, Rose Golden
Hmm, na-na-na-na-na-nah
The story of The Chosen
