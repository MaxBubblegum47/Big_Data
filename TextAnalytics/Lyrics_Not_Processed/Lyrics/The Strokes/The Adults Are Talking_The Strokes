[Verse 1]
They've been sayin' you're sophisticated
They're complainin', overeducated
You are saying all the words I'm dreaming
Say it after me
Say it after me
They will blame us, crucify and shame us
We can't help it if we are a problem
We are tryin' hard to get your attention
I'm climbin' up your wall
Climbin' up your wall

[Chorus]
Don't go there 'cause you'll never return

And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me too
But then you want me to do it the same way as you, and but

[Bridge]
I don't, I don't want anything
I know it's not, it's not your fault
I don't want anyone
As I do it's not for you

[Break]
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Stockholders
Same shit, a different life
I'll get it right sometime
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight

[Spoken]
Yeah boy, here we go
And a one, and a two, and a three
Here we go friends (Hold on, I can't)
Maybe that's a kooky situation
So let's go back to the old key, old tempo, everything
