[Verse 1]
In many ways, they'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes
When we was young, oh man, did we have fun
Always, always
Promises, they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

[Chorus]
Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling, your head's not right
Ah, see, alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
No, I ain't wasting no more time

[Interlude]
(Trying, trying)

[Verse 2]
And now my fears, they come to me in threes
So I sometimes
Say, "Fate, my friend, you say the strangest things
I find sometimes"

[Chorus]
Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
Shit, I will try my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling, your head's not right
Ah, see, alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
I ain't wasting no more time
