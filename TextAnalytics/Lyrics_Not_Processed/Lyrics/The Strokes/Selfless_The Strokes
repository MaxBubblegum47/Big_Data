[Verse 1]
Can the dark side light my way out? Yeah, yeah
Lay your hand across my face, yeah, yeah
Time we lost, that's all my fault

[Chorus]
Please don’t be long, 'cause I want you now
I don't have love without you around
Life is too short, but I will live for you

[Verse 2]
How did this fit in your story? Yeah-eah
Why’d you let them judge your body? Yeah-eah
I'll be waitin' there outside, yeah

[Chorus]
Please don't be long, 'cause I want your all
I don't have fun without your love
Life is too short, but I will live for you
You're mucking off, but I will live for you, my selfless love

[Bridge]
Bite my tongue, I wait my turn
I waited for a century
Waste my breath, no lessons learned
I turn and face the enemy
I'm not scared, just don’t care
I’m not listening, you hear?
He's never there, but I don’t care
I can't tell you what and where

[Outro]
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah
