[Intro: Southside & Future]
Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
