[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Uhh, alright
I did it, hahah, yeah

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Used to treat my mattress like the ATM, yeah
Bond No. 9 that's my favorite scent, yeah
Can't forget the kush, I'm talking OG, yeah
Rest in peace to pop, he was an OG, oh yeah
285 I had that pack on me, uh
I cannot forget I had that strap on me, yeah
Rest in peace to my nigga Doe (Troup)
All we ever want to do is ball
That was the easy part, we playing that Weezy hard
We sit in the kitchen late, we tryna to make an escape
Trying to make me a mil', so I'ma keep me a plate
I told 'em shawty can leave, so I'ma keep me a rake
So I'ma keep me a Wraith, my jewelry look like a lake
Today I'm in the Maybach
And that car came with some drapes
You know I look like a safe, I put you back in your place
I look you right in your face, sing to your bitch like I'm Drake
Yeah

[Chorus: Quavo]
Good drank, big knots
Good drugs, I put a four on the rocks (lean!)
Drop top, no hot box
12 tried to pull me over, pink slips to the cops
She said the molly give her thizz face
Put the dick in her rib cage
Whips out, Kunta Kinte
Diamonds clear like Bombay
Take your babies, no Harambe
Play with keys like Doc Dre
3K like André
And your girl, call her, come through

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucc
i
! Huh (brr!) huh!
Your trunk in the front
Well check this out my top in the trunk
You play with my money
Then check this out, yo, poppin' the trunk
Three mil in a month
But I just did three years on a bunk
Oh, you in a slump
I'm headed to Oakland like  Kevin Da Runt
What is your point?
Square with the stamp, for Kevin Durant
Lay on on my trap
Play with my cap and I'll knock off your hat
I'm taking the cheese and killing the rats
Gucci Mane, call me the cat with the racks
I'm swervin', but I'm in back of the 'Bach
I'm Persian, man I got hoes from Iraq
I'm servin' I pay a bird for that
He nervous, ain’t got no words for that
He hurt and want all of his purses back
He mixing the syrup with the Percocets
She perfect and she got perky breasts
I just want some of that turkey neck
Trapper of the year, I'm from Bouldercrest
You snitch of the year cause you told the bis'

[Chorus: Quavo]
Good drank, big knots
Good drugs, I put a four on the rocks
Drop top, no hot box
12 tried to pull me over, pink slips to the cops
She said the molly give her thizz face
Put the dick in her rib cage
Whips out Kunta Kinte
Diamonds clear like Bombay
Take your babies, no Harambe
Play with keys like Doc Dre
3K like Andre
And your girl, call her, come through

[Outro: 2 Chainz]
