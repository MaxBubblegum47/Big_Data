[Verse 1]
Oh, we had something
Had something bubbling
It was a fun thing
Ain't nothing troubling
I had the spring in my step
Like walking on trampolines
These days I'm looking back
But there's no sense in that
Searching for somebody new
Who can move me like you is a hopeless task
'Cause I got these chains on my feet
And everybody I'll be

[Chorus]
Ain't got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be opening presents
And hoping to have it for you
'Cause you always make it better
They've got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be blowing out candles
And wishing for someone like you
But there's no use

[Verse 2]
Nothing is possible
Now that I'm on my own
And if I don't do it for you
Then I just don't know how to do anything
Head's under water again
But I ain't no submarine
Try to come up again
Heading out with my friend
But I got these chains on my feet
And everybody I meet

[Chorus]
Ain't got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be opening presents
And hoping to have it for you
'Cause you always make it better
They've got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be blowing out candles
And wishing for someone like you
But there's no use

[Bridge]
Never knew how to say what I feel for you
You say it's too late, you don't feel the fire
You don't hear when I say there's nobody
They've got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be opening presents
And hoping to have it for you
'Cause you always make it better

[Chorus]
They've got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be opening presents
And hoping to have it for you
If it was my birthday
I'd be blowing out candles
And wishing for someone like you
But there's no use
