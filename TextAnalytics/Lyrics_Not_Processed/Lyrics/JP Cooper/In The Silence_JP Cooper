[Verse 1]
I've been seeking silver linings, feeling incomplete
Singing, "Oh, I wish it didn't taste so bittersweet"
So enamoured, stutter, stammered, oh, my voice was broke
Like a poor man stood before the queen
I tripped over my tongue before I spoke

[Chorus]
And though I never said it with words
There was love in the silence
Even now after all of these years
You're the light in my darkness

[Verse 2]
Used to share that feeling, dreaming
Gazing at the bedroom ceiling
Ooh, now I'm laying here wishing you'd come home

[Chorus]
And though I never said it with words
There was love in the silence
Even now after all of these years
You're the light in my darkness
Darling, please, listen close and you'll hear
There's still love in the silence
Even now after all these long years
I feel love in the quiet

[Bridge]
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

[Chorus]
And though I never said it with words
There was love in the silence
Even now after all of these years
You're the light in my darkness
Darling, please, listen close and you'll hear
There's still love in the silence
Even now after all these long years
I feel love in the quiet
