[Verse 1]
It started out in springtime
Against the golden skyline
You spoke to me at last
It started out intensely
And within all my senses I knew
I'm sure I knew

[Pre-Chorus]
The only reason God gave me eyes was to see you
The only reason God gave me ears was to hear your voice

[Chrous]
Say, I will al.. - I will always love you
And when the wind gets cold
I'll wrap my arms around you

[Verse 2]
We shared our dreams, endeavors and many things
We never could tell a soul before
I saw you smile through the tears that fell to the floor
I'm sure I knew

[Pre-Chorus]
The only reason God gave me hands was to hold you
And he finely tuned the drums of my ears just to hear your voice

[Chorus]
Say, I will al.. - I will always love you
And when the wind gets cold
I'll build a fire to warm your hands
I'll wrap my arms around you

[Bridge]
And I won't let shadows scare you in the stillness of the night
I'll be the cooling voice that tells you everything's alright
And when darkness tries to drag you down there will be a light
And no wind and no storm and no hatred can hide it
I'll help you find it

[Chorus]
And I will al.. - I will always love you
And when the wind gets cold
I'll wrap my arms around you
Ooh, and I need love - I will always love you
And when the wind gets cold
I'll build a fire to warm your hands
I'll wrap my arms around you
