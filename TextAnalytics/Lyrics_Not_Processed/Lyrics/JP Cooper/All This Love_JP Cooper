[Verse 1]
Every time I'm awake I can see your dress hanging on the back of the door
I feel like it's staring me down, so I look to the floor
Every time I move, tripping on your shoes, every time I open a drawer
I let the skeletons out and we dance through the hall

[Chorus]
I got all this love, nothing to do with it now
When you gonna come and get it? I can't throw it out
I got all this love gathering dust in my house
I got all this love, all this love

[Verse 2]
Water's getting rough, swimming in your stuff, I just wanna get to the shore
I'm drowning in memories of you that I try to ignore
Still, I'm playing host, hanging with the ghosts, telling them the story of you
They always laugh at my jokes as we dance through the room

[Chorus]
I got all this love, nothing to do with it now
When you gonna come and get it? I can't throw it out
I got all this love gathering dust in my house
I got all this love, all this love

[Bridge]
Baby, when you gonna come? (Gonna come)
Gonna come now
Are you ever gonna come? (Gonna come)
Gonna come now
Are you ever gonna come? (Gonna come)
Gonna come now

[Chorus]
I got all this love, nothing to do with it now
When you gonna come and get it? I can't throw it out
I got all this love gathering dust in my house
I got all this love, all this love

[Outro]
....
I got all this love, no one to give it to, no
