[Verse 1]
When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing
The blues

[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling, old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

[Verse 2]
What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling, old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah...
