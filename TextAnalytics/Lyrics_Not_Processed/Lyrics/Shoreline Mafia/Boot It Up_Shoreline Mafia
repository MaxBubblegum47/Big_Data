[Intro]
This is the Ace Production

[Verse 1: Fenix]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Your bitch all in my DM's sending me some pussy pictures
I fuck bad hoes, I got real niggas (Real niggas)
I got Xanax in my cup, like how you feel nigga
I been geeked up, geeked up (Geeked up)
Riding 'round town with my feet up
If my bitch tripping, I'll leave her
Then have a new bitch in a week, bruh
Me and Ohgees smoking purple by the pound
In your town, ride around, catch an opp and gun him down, nigga
All my bitches pop molly, sniff coke (Sniff coke)
I got a ho that give me Xans by the boat (Boat)
And damn all you niggas so fufu
Play with my money, I'll shoot you
I fell in love with the Screw juice
I turn up, go nuts, got some screws loose
Louis, the Gucci, and Dolce
I need a ho that go both ways (Ayy)
Syrup got me at a slow pace
Until I boot up like I'm lo way

[Verse 2: Ohgeesy]
Boot it up, boot it up, boot it up (Boot it)
Come to the party just to shoot it up
I don't need a plug, I get it off the boat (Off the boat)
Hit my line if you niggas need a quote (Need a quote)
Hit my line baby, I'ma get it sold (Get it sold)
Hit it once, then you leaving out the door (Out the door)
Pop me a double, I poured me a four
I'm smoking hella dope, fuck a groupie from the show
Hit her with that addy, tell the bitch where to go (Ayy)
Fenix fucked the bitch while a nigga got throat
We switch 'em and flip 'em 'cause we the bang bros
I'm smoking so much 'cause I'm needing that dope (Smoke, smoke)
I ran up my check as I'm whipping my wrist
I fuck on your ho then go home to my bitch
I'm sipping out the sip, codeine what I sip
And I'm drinking out the bottle when a nigga in the VIP (In the VIP)
I don't spoil your bitch nigga, your bitch spoil me
I see you niggas taking pictures with the foil teeth
I got real gold nigga, real gold all over me
I hold her from the back, you just hold her closely
Niggas ain't out fuckin' with me, no one close to me
Niggas talking shit but who the fuck you supposed to be
Niggas wifing bitches but she just a ho to me
Niggas wifing bitches but she just a ho to me, ayy
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
