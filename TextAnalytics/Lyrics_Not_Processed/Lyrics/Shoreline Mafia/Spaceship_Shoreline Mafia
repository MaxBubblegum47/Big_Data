[Chorus: Ketchy The Great]
She just wanna give me face in my spaceship
I just want to pour an eight in my spaceship
Forty bang with a K in my spaceship
Off the perky, I'm high in my spaceship
Trap out the spaceship, clap out the spaceship
Riding 'round town with a mask and a spaceship
Plastic and links, get a bag out the spaceship
I'm off the shit, do the dash in the spaceship

[Verse 1: Fenix]
No Nickelodeon, my niggas on some slime shit
I be sippin' juice, gettin' money out a dime bitch
She wanna spend more time but I ain't really got the time bitch
My niggas on some other shit, my niggas really timeless
Bye bitch, I'm gone, sippin' juice in the spaceship
Beat the brakes off your bitch, I think that pussy need some maintenance
Stone, Island, I got these bitches wildin'
Glock on my hip if these niggas with the trying

[Verse 2: Ralfy The Plug]
I'm pouring eights to the face in the spaceship
Swerving and swerving, I'm switching lanes in the spaceship
Got your bitch give me face in the spaceship
Runnin' from twelve
, doin' the race in the spaceship
I don't think you want to race with the spaceship
V8 coupe, you know that's high on the maintenance
VV's, they bling bling, nigga this not no play with shit
Fuck all that pump fake flexing, you gotta stay with strip

[Chorus: Ketchy The Great]
She just wanna give me face in my spaceship
I just want to pour an eight in my spaceship
Forty bang with a K in my spaceship
Off the perky, I'm high in my spaceship
Trap out the spaceship, clap out the spaceship
Riding 'round town with a mask and a spaceship
Plastic and links, get a bag out the spaceship
I'm off the shit, do the dash in the spaceship

[Verse 3: Ohgeesy]
I'm with the plug, so you know it's money convos
Nine on my back like I'm Rondo, bitch get out the condo
Dick on your tonsils
In the whip with a stick middle of the console
In the spaceship, goin' apeshit
Camouflage to the toe, I be on my Bape shit
Get rid of a ho, I don't ever really say shit
Niggas know the business, I ain't even have to say shit

[Verse 4: Good Finesse]
Good Finesse, I'm in the spaceship
Chains just dangling and pour got me swanging
High off a perk and your bitch she look basic
And please stay away if you ain't bringing in the franklins
Bro homie janky, but I ain't Franky
Snitch ass nigga, got your play took daily
I got your bitch in the foreign, gettin' top, never boring
Getting money every day while you niggas sleepin', snorin'

[Chorus: Ketchy The Great]
She just wanna give me face in my spaceship
I just want to pour an eight in my spaceship
Forty bang with a K in my spaceship
Off the perky, I'm high in my spaceship
Trap out the spaceship, clap out the spaceship
Riding 'round town with a mask and a spaceship
Plastic and links, get a bag out the spaceship
I'm off the shit, do the dash in the spaceship

[Verse 5: Rob Vicious]
Niggas trackin' when I pull up in that spaceship
Pull the trigger, fire spit and make the K lift
Shoot a nigga in his ass, tryna take shit
Bitch I know I ain't shit, it ain't a bitch I can't dick
Niggas heatin', let me know
I ain't worried 'bout a nigga, chopper sittin' on the floor
Talkin' all that shit and now he flippin' like a ho
Playin' like a bitch don't get you shit but exposed

[Verse 6: Young Bull]
Young Bull, bitch I'm slidin' in the spaceship
Mustang coupe, and I keep a couple franks bitch
Ten piece on me, and I'm sliding with a freak bitch
She gon' door knock, she gon' feet bleed
She gon' run up a check from a Stincy
Shoot a nigga out the spaceship if he tweakin'
Did the dash on twelve, now I'm creepin'
Young Bull bitch, Stinc Team too greedy

[Chorus: Ketchy The Great]
She just wanna give me face in my spaceship
I just want to pour an eight in my spaceship
Forty bang with a K in my spaceship
Off the perky, I'm high in my spaceship
Trap out the spaceship, clap out the spaceship
Riding 'round town with a mask and a spaceship
Plastic and links, get a bag out the spaceship
I'm off the shit, do the dash in the spaceship
