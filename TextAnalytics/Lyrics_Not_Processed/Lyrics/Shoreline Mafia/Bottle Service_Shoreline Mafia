[Verse 1: Fenix Flexin]
Bitch I got lean on me right now
I been sippin' juice, ridin' 'round in the coupe
Nigga sellin' lean on me like wow
I been sippin' goop, I can't sell no shit to you
I could pour red, drop it in a Big Blue
My nigga, who is you? what you really tryna do?
Say you really 'bout it, then my nigga make a move
All my niggas crazy, you could really make the news
I'ma drop eight ounces in a two liter soda
Lil baby can you hold up 'cause a nigga tryna pour up
Been sippin' for a week and now a nigga finna throw up
I got a pistol on me, I ain't worried what you throw up
Lil bitch, I'm off that shit
I been drinking cough syrup with no cough and shit
All these niggas talking juice, they need to stop that shit
You ain't nothing like me, homie I need my scripts
This ain't cheap, lil bitch, check the belt on these jeans
MGP and some Wock, pour a six with my team
Got your bitch right here tryna fuck on the gang
What you sayin'? quit playin'
Don't want smoke with my team, nigga

[Bridge: Ohgeesy]
You still sip Cîroc, my nigga I do lean
Fuck bottle service nigga, pop the seal on the sixteen
Security fuck with me, we brought in the beam
My bitch so thick, thirty-eight in the jeans
She suck on my dick, said it's tasting so clean
She just set him up so we takin' his cream
You still sip Cîroc, my nigga I do lean
Fuck bottle service nigga, pop the seal on the sixteen
Security fuck with me, I brought in the beam
My bitch so thick, thirty-eight in the jeans
She suck on my dick, said it's tasting so clean
She just set him up so we takin' his cream

[Verse 2: Ohgeesy]
Bitch I'm a dog just like Gizmo
I stay sipping pink and it ain't Pepto-Bismol
Nigga mind your biz though, how much you get the thizz for?
Pull up on your block, you get served through the window
They goin' ten a pop, I got bitches working blocks
I got niggas down to pop so that shit better stop
Got a bad lil bop and you know she give top
And you know she give top
Top top top for the whole crew
Pop pop pop if you roll through
Fuck your life, fuck then act like I don't know you
She call me a thot, lil bitch you is a ho too
You thought I didn't know that you fucked on the whole crew
Fenix just hit, now you expect me to hold you down
Bitch I'm the wave, you gon' drown
I'm poppin' the downers, I do nothin' but frown
I might keep you round if you light-skinned and brown
I know you heard 'bout me, I'm the talk of the town
Jeans hold the beam and the beam hold me down
She say she your queen but she just let you down
She fucked the whole team, now you kissing her mouth
Now we kicking her out
Fucked the whole team, now you kissing her mouth, ayy
Now we kicking her out, ayy
