[Chorus: Ohgeesy]
This ain't a Milly Rock, this a money dance
And my dick ain't hard, that's a thirty in my pants
I got thirty of them bands, I'ma make a stripper dance
And I'ma fuck a nigga bitch 'cause he nerdy, she a fan
The molly either white or it's yellow like some sand
If you need it, hit my line, know I got it, I'm the man
Oxycontin, thizzle, Xans, that's what made me all these bands
Niggas talkin' hella reckless so we layin' all these hands

[Verse 1: Ohgeesy]
Bands, bands, bands, all I think about commas
Thirty in a forty, all I think about drama
I'm finna get this money, give it right to my mama
Playin' with the chicken, you gon' meet all the llamas
Bands, bands, bands, all I think about commas
Thirty in a forty, all I think about drama
I'm finna get this money, give it right to my mama
Playin' with the chicken, you gon' meet all the llamas

[Verse 2: Rob Vicious]
I need money, I need weed, I need drank (I need drank)
Niggas knockin', ain't a fiend and I'm straight (Man)
These niggas tellin' stories but they don't be who we think (Nah)
Talkin' like he ain't a pussy but he lyin' in your face (Fuck)
I been bossin' since a rookie, watchin' niggas from the back
Smokin' cookie out the pack and shootin' niggas rockin' black (Rrah)
P's gettin' taxed, I guess I'm back to sellin' crack
Got a lick for couple racks, then tell a nigga where it's at (Where it's at)

[Chorus: Ohgeesy]
This ain't a Milly Rock, this a money dance
And my dick ain't hard, that's a thirty in my pants
I got thirty of them bands, I'ma make a stripper dance
And I'ma fuck a nigga bitch 'cause he nerdy, she a fan
The molly either white or it's yellow like some sand
If you need it, hit my line, know I got it, I'm the man
Oxycontin, thizzle, Xans, that's what made me all these bands
Niggas talkin' hella reckless so we layin' all these hands

[Verse 3: Fenix Flexin]
I sip big juice but you niggas probably knew that
I'm ridin' 'round with two straps, I'm wavy like a durag (Durag)
My niggas see a lick, we finna hit it, niggas do that (Do that)
I cheated on my bitch, I'm 'bout to go and buy a new bag (A new bag)
You niggas almost made it but you didn't, nigga, too bad (That's too bad)
I'm cashin', counted forty bands off the backend
What happened? Niggas talkin' reckless 'til we spazzin'
Poppin' it, my nigga, you ain't really 'bout that action (Poppin')

[Verse 4: Master Kato]
Tell that bitch to send them codes right now
I'm tryna get it, tryna get this shit gone right now, right now
I been juggin' off these phones like how
Nigga, how you turn a cool hundred to a light thou', light thou'?
This shit regular, baby, I swear to God (No cap)
No, you can't compare with us, lady, yo, this the mob (Bitch)
All my niggas ready like Freddy if it's a prob (Grrah)
Chop a nigga, now he spaghetti up in the pot

[Chorus: Ohgeesy]
This ain't a Milly Rock, this a money dance
And my dick ain't hard, that's a thirty in my pants
I got thirty of them bands, I'ma make a stripper dance
And I'ma fuck a nigga bitch 'cause he nerdy, she a fan
The molly either white or it's yellow like some sand
If you need it, hit my line, know I got it, I'm the man
Oxycontin, thizzle, Xans, that's what made me all these bands
Niggas talkin' hella reckless so we layin' all these hands
