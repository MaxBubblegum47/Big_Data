[Verse 1]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout sex
Everybody's talkin' 'bout ex
Like no one really wants to find a genuine connect
Before they even look at you, they move on to the next
And I know that they say
"Don't you worry," I'm the one
Then the very next day, they said they're done
And I don't want to listen to the shit you've spun
No, I don't want to listen to the shit you've spun

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk into a party, feelin' out of place
Everyone's too cool, everyone's too fake
I try to start a conversation but I can't seem to relate
Yo, I'm about to get an Uber

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so fucking cool
You're just way too fucking cool

[Verse 2]
And I don't really care if you're king
And I don't really care for gold things
You'll be pointing at some girls and saying, "Yeah, we had a thing"
But you're not fooling me
You're just a puppet on a string
Just a puppet on a string, oh
And they say, "Don't you worry, I'm the one"
Then the very next day, they said they're done
And I don't want to listen to the shit you've spun
No, I don't want to listen to the shit you've spun

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk into a party, feelin' out of place
Everyone's too cool, everyone's too fake
I try to start a conversation but I can't seem to relate (*Yawn*)

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so fucking cool
You're just way too fucking cool
'Cause you're so fucking cool
Walk into a party, feelin' out of place
Everyone's too cool, everyone's too fake (You're just way too fucking cool)
Walk into a party, feelin' out of place
'Cause you're so fucking cool

[Bridge]
Where have all my friends gone?
I seem to have lost them on my way
And now, their spots are filled with Ken dolls
That tell me that I have got to stay

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so fucking cool
You're just way too fucking cool
'Cause you're so fucking cool
Walk into a party, feelin' out of place
Everyone's too cool, everyone's too fake (You're just way too fucking cool)
Walk into a party, feelin' out of place
'Cause you're so fucking cool
