[Verse 1]
My boy's being sus
He was shady as fuck
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like
I love my split ends and by that I mean
He cuts 'em off

[Chorus]
My boy
My boy
My boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy
My boy
My boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Verse 2]
My boy's being sus
And he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father
My boy's an ugly crier
But he's such a pretty liar
And by that I mean he said he'd "change"

[Chorus]
My boy
My boy
My boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy
My boy
My boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Chorus]
My boy
My boy
My boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy
My boy
My boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Outro]
You want me to be yours
Well then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours
Well then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
