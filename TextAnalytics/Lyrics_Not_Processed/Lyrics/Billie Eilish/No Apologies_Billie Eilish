Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Rap]
I believe in bigger things than living like you´re trapped
Every day giving your all and just getting nothing back
There´s better places to be at so I´m chasing after that
I learned to focus on my gifts instead of only what I lack
They want you miserable cuz that´s the way they seem to live
The way this world is built is fucked and now it needs to give
I want a lot more but all I´m seeing is locked doors
But I´ll be damned if they keep me out this is everything that I´ve fought for
And I´m built for this (...) I´m overworking these day jobs for some asshole who don´t understand what I´m worth thinking they could play God
They fuck around with your money you're nothing to ´em its funny to ´em
They joke around when they hold you down but you work till your hands are bloody
And they don´t appreciate you when they seem to hate you
Take the (?) but you´ve got to breath if they think you different they´ll keep you in the spot where you don´t want to be
This world does not have to be the way it always seems
If I took my (?) (un)lawfully and live with no Apologies
