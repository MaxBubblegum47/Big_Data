[Intro]
Woo, I love the energy in here

[Verse 1]
Mmm, mm-mm, da-da-da
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyеs
Those ocean eyеs

[Verse 2]
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
I can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair, no fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes, those ocean eyes
(I'm scared) I'm scared
I've never, never, never, ooh (I've never fallen from quite this high)
Mmm (Fallin' into your ocean eyes)
Those ocean eyes

[Bridge]
(Seye naeco esoht)
(Seye naeco ruoy otni 'nillaf)
Ba-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ba-ba-da-da-da (Hgih siht etiuq morf nellaf reven ev'I)
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
