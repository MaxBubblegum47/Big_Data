[Verse]
Walking up the hill tonight
When you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make
All those mistakes and be wise
Please try to be patient
And know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to see
The strength inside me burning

[Chorus]
But where are you my angel now?
Don't you see me crying?
I know that you can't do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying

[Verse]
Walking up the hill tonight
When you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make
All those mistakes and be wise
But please try to be patient
And know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to see
The strength inside me burning

[Chorus]
But where are you my angel now?
Don't you see me crying?
I know that you can't do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying
