[Verse 2]
My boy's being sus and he don't know how to cuss, he just sounds like he's tryna be his father (Who are you?)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar and by that I mean he said he'd "change"

[Chorus]
My boy
My boy
My boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy
My boy
My boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

Don't love me like he promised

He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

You want me to be yours well then you gotta be mine, and if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours well then you gotta be mine, and if you want a good girl, then goodbye
