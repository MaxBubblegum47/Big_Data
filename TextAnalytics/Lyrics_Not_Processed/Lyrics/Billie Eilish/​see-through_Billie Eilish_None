[Verse 1]
Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care, but can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain around my neck
And now it's missing

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're looking at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

[Verse 2]
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you said it so sadly, so I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry, why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love when your love is never for me?

[Chorus]
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're looking at me like I'm see-through
