INTRO!
Vogue, work, love hurts, work that  ×2
(Verse)
Down on your beat and I’m moving to the beat, mmm I don’t know what to do now
Say you want some more well I’m ready play for keeps, ooh I’m stepping out here with you now
(Chorus)
You spin me, around here we go ×2
You spin me on your nine inch vinyl
Like an animal…..ooohhhhh im out of control
You spin me right round, baby baby baby
Like a record record record
Right round round
Neck, thighs, lips, eyes…. Want to taste?  Gotta work that!  ×2
(Verse)
Grab my hand and waste, pulled me closer to his face
Only one thing left to do now, we can go back to my place
Tag baby, its a race, its just too much saucе and too much juice now
Won’t you stay oh baby won’t you stay here and sеt me free (work that)
By the way oh baby by the way that love of yours of yours just won't let me be, ooooh
(Chorus)
You spin me, around here we go ×2
You spin me on your nine inch vinyl
Like an animal…..ooohhhhh im out of control
You spin me right round, baby - work
Like a record - work
Right round - work that
(Bridge)
Stay, baby won't you lay, rest me down to pray
Stay, baby won't you lay, trapped you in my dirty ways
Right round ×8
(Chorus)
You spin me, around here we go ×2
You spin me on your nine inch vinyl
Like an animal…..ooohhhhh im out of control
You spin me right round, baby baby baby
Like a record record record
Right round round
