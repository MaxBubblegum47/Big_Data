[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"寶貝，我感覺不太好," 那六個你永遠不會懂的字
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say
"永遠都不會放你走," 那五個你永遠不會說的字 
(Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
我獨自笑著假裝一切都沒事，四天卻從來不覺得這麼長
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away
如果三人成群而我們是其中二人，有一個人總會落單
(Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus 1]
I just wanna make you feel okay
我只是想讓你感覺好過
But all you do is look the other way
但你只看著另一頭
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
我沒法告訴你我有多希望我不想留下來
I just kinda wish you were gay
我真有點希望你是同性戀

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
有什麼原因我們沒法在一起？
Is there a 12 step just for you?
跟著12個步驟就能戒掉我對你的上癮嗎？
Our conversation's all in blue
我們的對話很鬱悶
11 "heys"
就那11個嘿 
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearing out my hair
十指搔著我的頭髮
Nine times you never made it there
九次你失約
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
我七點獨自吃著晚餐，而你卻只在六分鐘就能抵達的地方
(Yay)

[Chorus 2]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
我怎麼可以讓你感覺好過
When all you do is walk the other way?
當你只走向另一頭?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
我沒法告訴你我有多希望我不想留下來
I just kinda wish you were gay
我真有點希望你是同性戀

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
為了保留我的尊嚴
To give your lack of interest an explanation
也給你對我沒興趣一個解釋
Don't say I'm not your type
不要說我不是你的菜
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
就說我不是你的性傾向吧
I'm so selfish
我很自私
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
但因為你讓我很無助，yeah
And I can't stand another day
我沒法承受多一天
Stand another day
承受多一天

[Chorus 3]
I just wanna make you feel okay
我只是想讓你感覺好過
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
但你只看著另一頭， hmm

I just kinda wish you were gay
我真有點希望你是同性戀
