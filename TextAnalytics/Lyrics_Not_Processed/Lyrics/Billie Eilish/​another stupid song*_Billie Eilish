[Verse 1]
You're saying that you miss me, oh well
Never even got a kiss without a countdown
It's time to face the facts
You treat me like a snack
Only text back when you're hungry
Your love's so insecure
You're never really sure
Boy, you never listen

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

[Verse 2]
You're saying that you're sorry, so what?
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up
It's time to come to terms
Put myself first
When your bubble bursts got soap in your eye
Telling you it's wrong to break into my songs
Boy, you gotta listen

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

[Bridge]
So take this as my last goodbye
And play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try to reach
Your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line
Press record and hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you
Oh, to erase you
Oh, to erase you
Oh, oh
