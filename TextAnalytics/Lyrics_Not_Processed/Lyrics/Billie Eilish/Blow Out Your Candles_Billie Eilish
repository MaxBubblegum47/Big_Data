[Intro: Kids Birthday Party and (Billie Eilish)]
Happy Birthday! (Ouu, ouu)
Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday to you!
Ok blow out your candles!
*Laughing*

[Verse: L.A.Shawn]
Shh, blow out your candles
Go head Shawn and blow out on the cake
Everybody’s Watching, it’d be rude to make them wait
Make a wish but tell no one so it’d become true
Now everybody asking like I’m supposed to tell you
I wish that I was happy again
I wish that the smile on my face wasn’t pretend
I wish that I could go blow my own candles out
I wish I could live a day without getting the noose out

[Pre-Chorus: L.A.Shawn]
But happy birthday to me
Hold up black balloons for all to see
Told me read the cake text in a grown-up voice
Said our favorite second choice

[Chorus: L.A.Shawn and (Billie Eilish)]
Happy birthday to me (ouu, ouu)
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Yeah
Happy birthday to me (ouu, ouu)
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Yeah
Happy birthday to me (ouu, ouu)
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Yeah
Happy birthday to me (ouu, ouu)
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Shh, blow out your candles

[Verse: L.A.Shawn]
I wish my mother really gave a shit
Wasn’t so damn occupied with getting money and dick
Said she put this party together just for me
But ended up charging an entrance fee
I wish I didn’t find happiness in liquor
I wish but I don’t wish these pills would kill me quicker
I wish I was first choice to my only lover
I’m the only kid at dis party without a father

[Pre-Chorus: L.A.Shawn]
But happy birthday to me
Hold up black balloons for all to see
Told me read the cake text in a grown-up voice
Said our favorite second choice

[Chorus: L.A.Shawn and (Billie Eilish)]
Happy birthday to me (ouu, ouu)
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Yeah
Happy birthday to me (ouu, ouu)
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Yeah
Happy birthday to me (ouu, ouu)
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Yeah
Happy birthday to me (ouu, ouu)
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Shh, blow out your candles

[Outro: Billie Eilish and (L.A.Shawn)]
People can try to help me and you know talk to me and whatever (yeah)
But its like, it doesn't, that's, it doesn't change anything. (Right, right)
The only person that can change the way that I feel is me
