[Verse 1]
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe it's in the–
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter)
Maybe it's in the–
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter)

[Verse 2]
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe it's in the– (and now I got a–)
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter)
Maybe it's in the– (and now I got a–)
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter)

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe it's in the–
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter)
Maybe it's in the
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter, the gutter)

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
