Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can’t help falling in love with you?

-(Oh, here's when it gets hard)
Like a- wait
Like a river flows
Like a river flows
-(I'm just gonna not play it)
Surely to the sea
My darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can’t help falling in love with you
