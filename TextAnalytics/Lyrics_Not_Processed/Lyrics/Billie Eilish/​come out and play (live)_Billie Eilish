[Intro]
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet, hmm
Quiet, mmm
You see the piece of paper
It could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it, mmm
And you don't have to keep it quiet, hmm

[Chorus]
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Verse 2]
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, and feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence, mmm
And you don't have to keep it quiet, ah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play
