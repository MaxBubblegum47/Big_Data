The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
I'm home alone, you God knows where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you evеry piece of me
But I will nеver can afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it (Ariana...)

When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
