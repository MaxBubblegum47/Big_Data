[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all
Scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse
I don't dream

You say
Come over baby
I think you're pretty
I'm okay
I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 3: Childish Major]
Like love me leave me 'lone huh
See me, see me throne
Eyes red, you see me blown
Be like me, me can't be cloned
King me, feed me gold
If she queen she see me soul
If not solo me be dolo
Answer no texts or no phones
Sure I'll take your photo then me dip off and meet robo
More I climb she want me wanna duck off and get low low
Opinions is only for my friends and them
Gang, gang, gang you hanging, only accepted by limbs and them
Love to hear the crowd stuff, 10 milli with the Timbs on them
Timbaland and Timberlake, cry 'way pools and a lake for him
Gimme all the bread, souffl√© and bake for him
Make him feelin' safe for him
Hook it up like [?] for him
Hooray for him? Hooray for him
15 minutes extended, rented but look it's bust down
Never been afraid of flying, I fear the touchdown
Heaven sounds, with all the Hell around
You look around, it's on the ground
Look what I found, I got it now

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one
