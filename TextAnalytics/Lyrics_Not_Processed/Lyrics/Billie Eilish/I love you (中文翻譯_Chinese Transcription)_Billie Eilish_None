[Verse 1]
It's not true

Tell me I've been lied to
告訴我我是被騙的
Crying isn't like you, ooh

What the hell did I do?
我到底做了什麼鬼？
Never been the type to
從來都不是
Let someone see right through, ooh
讓某個人看透我的類型，ooh

[Chorus 1]
Hmm, maybe won't you take it back?
Hmm, 也許你可以收起吧
Say you were tryna make me laugh
說你會試著逗我笑
And nothing has to change today
而如今沒什麼事情需要改變
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
你不用說「我愛你」
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
我愛你，但我不想，ooh

[Verse 2]
Up all night on another red-eye
又帶著另一雙紅眼睛熬過整晚
I wish we never learned to fly
我希望我們從未學習如何往前走
Maybe we should just try
也許我們應該做的就是試著
To tell ourselves a good lie
自欺欺人說過得很好
Didn't mean to make you cry
我並不想讓你哭泣的

Hmm, maybe won't you take it back?

[Bridge]
The smile that you gave me
那個你給我的笑容
Even when you felt like dying

[Outro]
We fall apart as it gets dark
當這段感情走下坡時，我們心都破碎了
I'm in your arms in Central Park
在中央公園裡，我在你的懷中
There's nothing you could do or say
你沒什麼能做或說的
I can't escape the way I love you
我則無法逃避自己有多愛你
I don't want to, but I love you, ooh
我並不想的，但我愛你，ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
