[Lyrics from Snippet]
I've got a man that doesn't love me
He's got a girl that doesn't love him
She's got a brother down in county
He's got a tattoo for his cousin
Another house on fire by Venice beach
She's got a man she doesn't love who doesn't  love me
Another house on fire by Venice Beach
She's got a man she doesn't love who doesn't love me
I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, doesn't love me)
I don't need to know
