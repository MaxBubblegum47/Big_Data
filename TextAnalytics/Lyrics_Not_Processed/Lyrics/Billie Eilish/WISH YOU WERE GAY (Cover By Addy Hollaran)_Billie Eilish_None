Verse:
Baby, I don't feel so good
Six words you never understood
I'll never let you go
Five words you never say
I laugh alone like nothing's wrong
Four days have never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us
One slipped away
Chorus:
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, mm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, mm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Bridge:
{Instrumental}
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, mm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Chorus:
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, mm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Outro:
I just kinda wish you were gay
