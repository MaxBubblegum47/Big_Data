[Verse 1]
Lights out
You're not here holding me
I count
Every tear down my cheek
Instead of sheep

[Verse 2]
Sleep walk
Find myself on your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then I leave

[Chorus]
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

[Verse 3]
Cold days
Frozen lake in the park
Old ways
Make mistakes when I'm lost
Now we've got it all

[Verse 4]
Bad dreams
Might not mean anything
But you seem
Not to need anything

[Chorus]
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

[Bridge]
I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue, hey
True blue

[Chorus]
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
I tried to live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

[Outro]
And I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue, hey
True blue
