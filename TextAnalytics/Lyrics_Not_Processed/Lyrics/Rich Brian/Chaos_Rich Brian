[Intro]
Yeah, happy birthday to me
I'm 18 now
And women can legally have sex with me
Shout out Based God

[Chorus]
I be ridin' right down Melrose with a thicky named Rose
Sittin' on my lap, but she just tryna be my friend, though
Bumpin' on that XO and I'm 'bout to call my ex ho
Mommy, daddy home, I barely see them like a rainbow

[Verse 1]
You can't get rid of me, I ain't goin' nowhere
And I'm always multiplyin' like I always fornicate
Cake, cake up on this belt, the day I landed in the States
Doin' one take all day and I'm just spittin' out the mace (mace)
She like sippin' out that mason jar
She a hippie, she gon' suck for some granola bars
Little freaky got me curious like I'm on Mars
Sayin', I forgot my roots, goddamn, you went too far

[Bridge]
Ayy, damn you went too far
Got these people all around me, man, that treat me like a star
Dressed like I don't give a damn, but I be ballin' like LaVar
Gotta wait about three years, until I could go to the bar

[Verse 2]
Damn, make all my own shit, I get all the profits
If you actin' lazy, then do not expect your props, bitch
Movin' with the tactics, got Gildan on my fabrics
Go ham on the mic, just like I'm sitting in the cockpit, ayy
Used to hate the camera, now your boy's a natural
Now your boy is on the road two months and I'ma get the load
Try to put me in a box, I'm gon' always break the lock
Call me D-Wayne, 'cause she licking on my Johnson like The Rock
Oh my God, man, his voice so deep, I thought he was 21 plus
Brian be so clean, wanna let him spank on my bum
He just turned 18, but for him, I'd catch a case, damn (hold up)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ayy, that was the sound of yo' bitch
And everybody that heard what I did
I don't like being so ignorant
But you gon' make me go back to my bullshit again

[Chorus]
I be ridin' right down Melrose with a thicky named Rose
Sittin' on my lap, but she just tryna be my friend, though
Bumpin' on that XO and I'm 'bout to call my ex ho
Mommy, daddy home, I barely see them like a rainbow
