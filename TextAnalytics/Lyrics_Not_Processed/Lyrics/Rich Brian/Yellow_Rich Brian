[Chorus: Rich Brian]
How do I disappear without anybody knowing?
Will anybody even miss me when I'm gone?

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
Bottle full of liquor, I'ma drown tonight
Life looks so easy, all you gotta  do is close your eyes
Please don't call the reverend, I don't need no help
Bury me a legend, I'ma dig the grave myself
I can't remember when I last felt alive
Don't try to save my life, I'm already on my way tonight
The blood is on my hands, it's either do or die
Don't even try to save my life (Save my life)
They gon' memorize my name when I'm gone
And they gon' recognize my face when I'm gone
(They gon' love me when I'm gone)

[Chorus: Rich Brian]
How do I disappear without anybody knowing?
Will anybody even miss me when I'm gone?

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Bitch, hello
(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello)
Don't fight the feeling 'cause I'm yellow
(Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow)
Will I make it? Who the hell knows?
(Hell knows, hell knows, hell knows, hell knows, hell knows, hell knows, hell knows)
You want my soul but we don't sell those
(Sell those, sell those, sell those, sell those, sell those, sell those, sell those)
Yeah, ayy, oh
Got a full clip, don't even carry no guns (Gun)
Don't need no ICE, feel like I'm 21 (21)
Breakfast and lunch, she gon' swallow my sons (Sons)
Dinner, dessert, eat these rappers for fun (Fun)
Don't give no fucks if you don't fuck with my shit
Rock 50 stages in all 50 states, bitch
I did it all without no citizenship
To show the whole world you just got to imagine

[Outro: BÄ“kon]
On the day (On the day)
The bullets block out the sun (The sun)
We are fools (We are fools)
Pointing at everyone (Everyone)
But ourselves
'Cause we're the only ones to blame (We're the only ones to blame)
It's insane (Oh, it's insane)
'Cause no one ever wants to change
