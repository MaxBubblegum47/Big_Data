[Intro: Lil Pump]
Huh
Ooh, Bi-Big Head on the beat
Ayy, Lil Pump
Ronny J on the beat, bitch
Lil Pump, ayy

[Chorus]
I got designer from head to my toe
I'm on the Xan, and my bitch on that coke
I got Givenchy all over my coat
I'm off that X, 
and I just poured a four
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean

[Verse]
Lil Pump, rich, he finna get richer
I pop a bean, then fuck on your sister
Nut on her lip, and then you gon' kiss her
Ice on my neck, it lookin' like glitter (brr, brr)
I got designer from head to my feet (ooh)
I pop a X, so you know I be geeked (damn)
Rockin' Balmains and they all on my jeans (ooh)
I'm off the Xans, and I pour me some lean (Lil Pump)
I sell your mama some crack, she a fiend (huh?)
I crash the Porsche and I just left the scene (brr)
Drippin' designer, Burberry my sweater
Lil Pump pulled up, he changin' the weather (brr, brr)
I pop a molly, I pop a bean
I fuck your bitch 'cause she down for the team
Jump in a car and hit you with the beam (huh?)
I chug a pint and I just go to sleep

[Chorus]
I got designer from head to my toe
I'm on the Xan, and my bitch on that coke
I got Givenchy all over my coat
I'm off that X, 
and I just poured a four
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I got designer from head to my toe
I'm on the Xan, and my bitch on that coke
I got Givenchy all over my coat
I'm off that X, 
and I just poured a four
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
I'm on the molly, I'm on the bean
