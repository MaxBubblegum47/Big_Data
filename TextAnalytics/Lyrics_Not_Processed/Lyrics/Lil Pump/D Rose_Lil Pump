[Verse]
Hundred on my wrist, bitch, I'm feelin' like D. Rose
Pop four Xans, now I'm feelin' like a hero (Superman)
Lean got me like Rio (Rio)
And my auntie on P.O. (P.O.)
Hundred on my wrist, eighty on a brick
Lil Pump never spend his money on a bitch (Never)
Never trust a nigga, 'cause he actin' like a bitch (Ooh)
Take a nigga bitch to the Motel 6 (Brr)
I just broke my wrist, 'cause I'm whippin' in the kitchen (Yoop)
Pass a brick to my mom, and I told her whip it (Whip)
Four bands in the kitchen (Ayy)
Nine bands in the kitchen (Ayy)
I just fucked your bitch (What?)
I just broke my wrist (Okay)
I just fucked your bitch (Ooh)
I just fucked your bitch (Ok-)
