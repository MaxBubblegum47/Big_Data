[Intro: Humming]

[Verse]
You're on your own
In a world you've grown
Few more years to go
Don't let the hurdle fall
So be the girl you loved
Be the girl you loved

[Pre Chorus]
I'll wait
So show me why you’re strong
Ignore everybody else
We're alone now
I'll wait
So show me why you’re strong
Ignore everybody else
We’re alone now

[Chorus]
Suddenly I'm hit
It's the starkness of the dawn
And your friends are gone
And your friends won’t come
So show me where you fit
So show me where you fit

[Pre Chorus]
I'll wait
So show me why you're strong
Ignore everybody else
We’re alone now (We’re alone now)
I'll wait (We’re alone now)
(We’re alone now)
(We’re alone now)
I'll wait (We’re alone now)
(We’re alone now)
(We’re alone now)
(We’re alone now)
(We’re alone now)

[Chorus]
Suddenly I'm hit
It's the starkness of the dawn
And your friends are gone
And your friends won’t come
So show me where you fit
So show me where you fit
