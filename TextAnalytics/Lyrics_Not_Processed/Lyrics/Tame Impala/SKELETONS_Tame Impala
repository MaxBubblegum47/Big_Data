Yeah, yeah, yeah (
Yeah
, ooh)
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed (Yeah)
(
Yeah, yeah
)
Louder (
Louder
)
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (
Uhh, yeah
)
It's like standing in the ocean

[Verse: Travis Scott, 
Pharrell Williams
, & The Weeknd]
We just rocked Coachella, I gave her half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
(
Just let this wash on me
)
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex
If you take your girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out, do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace
(
Just let this wash on me
)
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic

[Bridge: The Weeknd & 
Pharrell Williams
]
Like floating, if I can't be in time
I don't know, I don't know (
Wash on me, wash on me, yeah
)
In the ocean, if I can't be loved
I don't know a sound
(That's right)

[Outro: Pharrell Williams, 
Travis Scott
, Kevin Parker & 
Th
e Weeknd
]
Standing in the ocean (
Standing in the ocean
)
Just let this wash on me (
Ooh
)
Bad memories like waves
Echoing (
Echoing
), echoing
Standing in the ocean
(
Oh, baby
)
Standing in the ocean
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed
