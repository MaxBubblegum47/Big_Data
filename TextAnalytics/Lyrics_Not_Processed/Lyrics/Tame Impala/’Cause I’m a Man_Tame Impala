[Verse 1]
Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fuck up that I make, it makes you cry
I'm just pathetic, that's the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you
 (Uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't often prowl before I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

[Verse 2]
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?
(Why?) You never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?) I have no voice if I don’t speak my mind
(Why?) My weakness is the source of all my pride
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you
 (Uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
I'll never be as strong as you
I'm a human, human
A greater force I answer to
 (Uh)
