[Verse 1]
I was raging, it was late
In the world my demons cultivate
I felt the strangest emotion
But it wasn't hate for once
Yes I'm changing, yes I'm gone
Yes I'm older, yes I'm moving on
And if you don't think it's a crime
You can come along with me
Life is moving, can't you see
There's no future left for you and me
I was hoping and I was searching endlessly
But baby, now there's nothing left that I can do

[Chorus]
So don't be blue
There is another future
Waiting there for you

[Verse 2]
I saw it different, I must admit
I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it
They say people never change
But that's bullshit, they do
Yes I'm changing, can't stop it now
And even if I wanted I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself
I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame
There is a world out there
And it's calling my name
And it's calling yours, girl

[Chorus]
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too

[Outro]
It's calling out for you
Arise and walk on through
(Time rolls on)
A world beyond that door is calling out for you
(Time rolls on)
Arise and walk on through
It's calling out for you
(Listen to it call)
Arise and walk, come through
A world beyond that door
(Listen to it call)
Is calling out for you
