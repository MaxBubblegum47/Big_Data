[Verse 1]
If only there could be
Another way to do this
'Cause it feels like murder
To put your heart through this
I know I always said
That I could never hurt you
Well, this is the very, very last time
I'm ever going to

[Chorus]
But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too
Said I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too
Eventually
Eventually

[Verse 2]
Wish I could turn
You back into a stranger
'Cause if I was never in your life
You wouldn't have to change it

[Chorus]
But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too
Said I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too
Eventually
Eventually

[Bridge]
And I know just what I've got to do
And it's got to be soon
'Cause I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too

[Chorus]
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
