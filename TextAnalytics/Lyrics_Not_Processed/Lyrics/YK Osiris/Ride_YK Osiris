[Intro: YK Osiris]
When you jump in my caddy
Won't make it back and
Tell your nigga, you might not make it home, tonight
After the show out, show and I prove to you
Why you should be here right by my side

[Verse 1: YK Osiris]
Six in the morning and you ain't been out long
But we ain't go home
If fucking you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
So baby, can we make love for the night?

[Chorus: YK Osiris]
Can you ride, ride?
Ride me like the last rodeo, baby
Hold on tight and never let it go, baby
All I want you to do is ride, ride
Ride me like the last rodeo, baby
Hold on tight and never let it go, baby
Take control, baby

[Verse 2: YK Osiris]
Beep, beep
Shawty, if you ride it like my Jeep
I'ma pull up on you, baby, it's a late night creep, ye-yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, woah, woah
You know I pull up with that good D
Put your ass to deep sleep
Wanna see all that shit you told last week
Tell me can you handle it?
Wanna see your stamina
Do it so good that I put you up on my calendar

[Chorus: YK Osiris]
Ride, ride
Ride me like the last rodeo, baby
Hold on tight and never let it go, baby
All I want you to do is ride, ride
Ride me like the last rodeo, baby
Hold on tight and never let it go, baby
Take control, baby

[Verse 3: Kehlani]
You want me to ride it
I want you to dive in
Put your pride to the side and get loud here when you hide it
Learned some new things, some new tricks, say we should try it
Doin' all that shit, you curious, you can't deny it
That's why I keep on coming back, that's why I keep on running back
Get 1 A.M. to the Hills 'cause you know I'm stuck on that
They say that good dick make you hazy
And all that hood shit drive me brazy

[Verse 4: YK Osiris]
Girl, would you ride with me?
Come, take a drive with me
Got you in passenger
You're right beside of me
I'm tryna speed it up
There ain't no stopping me
I love that rearview but all I really wanna see is that you (All I really wanna see)

[Chorus: YK Osiris & Kehlani]
Ride, ride
Ride me like the last rodeo, baby
Hold on tight and never let it go, baby
All I want you to do is ride, ride
Ride me like the last rodeo, baby
Hold on tight and never let it go, baby
Take control, baby

[Outro: YK Osiris & 
Kehlani

Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride (
Last rodeo, baby
)
Ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride (
Ride you like the last rodeo, baby
)
Baby, ride
Baby, ride, ride, ride, ride
