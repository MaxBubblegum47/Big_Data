[Chorus]
I'm not an Indian, but I be chiefin'
I grow that indica and that sativa
Took her to the crib and put her in a sleeper
She need her a breather
They love me, my prices be cheaper
My hundreds blue like a Skeeter
These niggas annoying just like some mosquitoes
She told me go deeper
A street nigga gave me ten P's for a feature
He said that, "I heard all your tapes, I believe you"
It's hard to trust people 'cause people so evil
I feel like a king, I be feelin' medieval
Just put a pound on the passenger seat of the Regal
I keep it 1K with my people
Don't let these broke niggas mislead you
Don't let these fake niggas deceive you
She came on my sheets, we fuck to the beat
She got that water just like she a beach
These niggas groupies just like they a freak
My money be neat
Ran up that sack, had to buy me some cleats
I ride with the stick with the doors off the Jeep
We just fuck to the beat, we might fuck on the sheets
She came on my sheets, niggas lie through they teeth
Fifty rounds on me for niggas who deep
I do this shit in my sleep

[Verse]
Yeah
These niggas be crossin', I'm just gon' off 'em
I'm in the growhouse just waterin' often
I hit lil' mama, she said it was awesome
I brought the drum like I'm playing percussion
I got me a rental from Budget
These bales that I got, they won't fit inside, so I'ma stuff 'em
He turned his back on me, plug droppin' packs on me
Knee-deep in loud, I just left out a factory
I'm high as hell, I ain't feelin' no gravity
Just like a turkey, she gobble and swallow me
Ride with the pack, so I found me a trailer to follow me
Niggas gon' die if they think about robbin' me
Clientele callin' me, why they keep callin' me?
I got the cheapest, I spent 2K on some sneakers in Nieman's
She got that ocean, that water
She bad and she gorgeous
I drive me some bales back to Georgia
Them P's get imported, I can't be extorted
Run up, lil' nigga, the news gon' report it
I'm trying to be cordial, these niggas be extra
I just caught a play in a motherfuckin' Tesla
Stick on the dresser, I'm traffickin' presidents
These niggas be tellin', I weigh it and scale it and mail it

[Chorus]
I'm not an Indian, but I be chiefin'
I grow that indica and that sativa
Took her to the crib and put her in a sleeper
She need her a breather
They love me, my prices be cheaper
My hundreds blue like a Skeeter
These niggas annoying just like some mosquitoes
She told me go deeper
A street nigga gave me ten P's for a feature
He said that, "I heard all your tapes, I believe you"
It's hard to trust people 'cause people so evil
I feel like a king, I be feelin' medieval
Just put a pound on the passenger seat of the Regal
I keep it 1K with my people
Don't let these broke niggas mislead you
Don't let these fake niggas deceive you
She came on my sheets, we fuck to the beat
She got that water just like she a beast
These niggas groupies just like they a freak
My money be neat
Ran up that sack, had to buy me some cleats
I ride with the stick with the doors off the Jeep
We just fuck to the beat, we might fuck on the sheets
She came on my sheets, niggas lie through they teeth
Fifty rounds on me for niggas who deep
I do this shit in my sleep
