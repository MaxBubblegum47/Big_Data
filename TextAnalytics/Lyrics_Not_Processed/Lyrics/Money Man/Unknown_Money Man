[Chorus]
Heard them lil' threats you sent, they don't mean shit
I'm in the trap on some green shit
Got my unc' on the stove with a mean wrist
Got a bitch in my bed on some freak shit
Come and take your lil' pack on some free shit
Had to pray for a check, on my knees shit
All this jewelry on me, I can freeze shit
Ain't no "I" in team, we on some "we" shit
Did this shit on my own, I don't need help
Got the strap on my lap like a seatbelt
Secret service cars, I know how Meek feel
Had a lot of friends that ain't mean me well
Sellin' Gushers so I can feed my kids
Work so hard, I just did me like three shifts
Got four cars, nigga, I don't need no Lyft
Got two F&N's and they on both hips
Got two sticks with me, but I got four clips
When I fuck her, I fuck her so focused
Shawty love me 'cause I don't take no shit
She gon' do what I say, I'm controlling
Baby girl, make sure that them legs open
I be cautious, ain't tryna see no pen', yeah
All this juggin', I just bought a new Benz, yeah
Said you was down, but you lied to me
Say you want smoke, but you hiding from me
I be spendin' 'cause no, you can't die with money

[Verse]
When you crossed me, it almost brought me to tears
Had to man up and go face all of my fears
And my chick from a whole 'nother hemisphere
In a foreign, you know that I'm switching gears
In the studio, I'm my own engineer
Need an addy for P's, you can send 'em here
Feel the walls closing in, I can tell it's near
All this loud in the house, I can barely hear
In designer, 12 locked me up, profiling
I be fresh as hell, I don't need no stylist
Got like 80K spread out in four pockets
Got some CPN CC's in my wallet
When she see them racks, she be like, "Damn, daddy"
And that BC shit, that there is my family
I'm on drank in the hotel in Miami
Finna buy me some land to grow out in Canton
Sold so much of it that people done took advantage
Wanna go away, wish I could go and vanish
On them drugs, I'ma go to another planet
If you not from the streets, you won't understand me
Niggas plotting on me, they so underhanded
She gon' come in the room with no bra and panties
All my P's gone, I'm feeling so fine and dandy
And the strain that I'm burning is Cotton Candy, yeah
My niggas animals, they ain't got no conscience
Burn a lil' nigga, I'm dialed in
Plus keep a stick for the freak shit
And I got a shop in the district
I was in the projects stressing
All these racks, they a blessing
Every night, I was clutching my weapon

[Chorus]
Heard them lil' threats you sent, they don't mean shit
I'm in the trap on some green shit
Got my unc' on the stove with a mean wrist
Got a bitch in my bed on some freak shit
Come and take your lil' pack on some free shit
Had to pray for a check, on my knees shit
All this jewelry on me, I can freeze shit
Ain't no "I" in team, we on some "we" shit
Did this shit on my own, I don't need help
Got the strap on my lap like a seatbelt
Secret service cars, I know how Meek feel
Had a lot of friends that ain't mean me well
Sellin' Gushers so I can feed my kids
Work so hard, I just did me like three shifts
Got four cars, nigga, I don't need no Lyft
Got two F&N's and they on both hips
Got two sticks with me, but I got four clips
When I fuck her, I fuck her so focused
Shawty love me 'cause I don't take no shit
She gon' do what I say, I'm controlling
Baby girl, make sure that them legs open
I be cautious, ain't tryna see no pen', yeah
All this juggin', I just bought a new Benz, yeah
Said you was down, but you lied to me
Say you want smoke, but you hiding from me
