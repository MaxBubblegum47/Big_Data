[Verse 1]
How could I ignore you?
Trust me I adore you
We’re swimming through our dreams
Kiss me in the shower
For a couple hours
Though we’re only sixteen
And sit down beside me
Don’t call me daddy
Cause that’s just fucking weird
Promise that you'll stay here
You and I can lay here
Until the end of time

[Chorus]
But girl, well don't you worry about me
It ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely (Darling)
Girl, don't worry about me
But if you’re ever unhappy
Then maybe, baby, I must let you go
Let you go

[Verse 2]
Baby, now it’s best here, to lay me down and rest here
Let’s dream of Corduroy
Work for what you love to do and I will watch right over you
With your heart, I’ll never toy
And you’re the other half of me
Drink and sleep and laugh with me
Save me from myself
See I’m a fucking basket-case
Until I'm able to see your face
You saved me from myself

[Chorus]
But girl, don't worry about me
Cause it ain't new to me, feeling this lonely
Darling baby, girl, don't worry about me
Cause if you're ever unhappy, if you’re ever unhappy
If you’re ever, ever unhappy
Then maybe, maybe baby I must let you go
