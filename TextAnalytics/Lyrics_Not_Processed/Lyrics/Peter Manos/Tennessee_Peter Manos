[Verse 1]
Nothing to hold on to
You don't understand
It's such a simple thing
And last week, I ran into you
You don't realize, I'm paralyzed

[Refrain]
You don't answer my calls
You pull back and I draw
You don't understand
How could I understand?
You don't answer my calls
You pull back and I draw
You don't understand
How could I understand?

[Chorus]
That nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes
I wish I could change this
But nothing ever changes

[Verse 2]
It's something I can't unsee
You said you'd remember me
When I moved from Tennessee
You think that I'd already know (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
That nothing ever changes (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing ever changes (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wish I could change this (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
But nothing ever changes (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Refrain]
You don't answer my calls (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You pull back and I draw (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You don't understand (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
How could I understand? (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You don't answer my calls (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You pull back and I draw (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
You don't understand (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
How could I understand?
