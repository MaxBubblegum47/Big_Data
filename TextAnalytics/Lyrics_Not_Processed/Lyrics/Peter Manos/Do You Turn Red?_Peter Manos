[Verse]
Do you turn red?
When I am freezing
I close my eyes and dream about it
I remember what I did
I'd fold and lose it
Then I'd wake up and scream in my bed
Yes, I remember everything
You'd look at me with eyes glistening
(Glistening, glistening, glistening)
Then I'd turn red
And feel like sinking
We'd howl about it in the morning
You would tell me everything
Not like it's desperate
I reimagine every day
I know I magnify in my head
I'm scared I won't forget 'til I'm dead
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm-
