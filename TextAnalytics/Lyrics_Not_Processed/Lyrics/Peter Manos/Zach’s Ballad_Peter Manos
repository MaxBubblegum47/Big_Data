[Verse 1]
I don't really wanna talk about what's on my mind
Can't you tell me all the little things I can't define?
Like where were you last summer? And all through December?
Can't I remember anything but the golden times?
Maybe I'll find some peace of my mind
Maybe I won't, maybe I won't

[Chorus]
Ooh, sometimes I still wonder why you're not around
Sometimes I still think about it
Ooh, sometimes I still feel like I'm drowning out
Forget about it, can't compensate no more

[Verse 2]
Maybe I stop questioning the meaning
You'd ask me what is real and
Maybe where my hand's been (
Real
)
But back in the day, I
'Member my face, I
Romanticize the feeling, bottle up the reasons
I think I can make it

[Chorus]
Ooh, sometimes I still wonder why you're not around
Sometimes I still think about it
Ooh, sometimes I still feel like I'm drowning out
Forget about it, can't compensate no more

[Outro]
I'm closing my eyes, ask if I'm alive
No, I'm just tired and can't fall asleep
I'm really just fine, but I realize
I can't rely on you anymore
