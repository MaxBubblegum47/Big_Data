[Verse 1]
You forgot to
Turn the light out
When you left last night
And I don't know when
Or what just happened
But I know we tried, but you're

[Chorus]
Out of love (Yeah)
Out of love (Yeah)
Out of love (Yeah)
Or out of love (Oh oh, Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I remember when you told me
You had nothing but me
Crying on my shoulder
Damn, we're getting older
Can't trust we (We)

[Verse 3]
And I know you had nothing left for me
You said you had nothing but me
Tell me, baby, no it's not that easy (Uh huh huh)
I don't like that you don't love me anymore
Staring at your ceiling, crying on the floor

[Chorus]
We're out of love
Out of love (Yeah)
We're out of love
We're out of love
Out of love (Yeah)
We're out of love (Uh huh huh)
