[Intro: Meghan Trainor & Nicki Minaj]
Nice to meet ya (Mmm, ooh)
Nice to meet ya (Ooh)
Nice to meet ya (Meghan Trainor)
Nice to meet ya (Let's go)

[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor]
I used my makeup to hide (Hide)
Tellin' you there ain't nothin' I haven't tried (Tried)
Changed my hair, but I couldn't change up my mind (My-my-my mind)
You know I've been tryna work it (Yeah, yeah)
You know ain't nobody perfect (Yeah, yeah)
Go ahead, go talk about me (Me)
You don't know the half of the shit that I've seen (I've seen)
Go ahead and tell them whatever you heard (What you heard)
I look different on the surface (Yeah, yeah)
You know ain't nobody perfect (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I am blessed by the heavens
Someone's got a hold on me
Sweet, but I get rough, just what I wanna be
What I wanna be, just what I wanna be
I don't know you, but
I am blessed by the heavens
Someone's got a hold on me
Sweet, but I get rough, just what I wanna be
What I wanna be, just what I wanna be
I don't know you, but I'm just what I wanna be

[Post-Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
Nice to meet ya
Nice to meet ya
Nice to meet ya
Nice to meet ya

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor]
I used to care way too much (Much)
Filtered myself, I thought I wasn't enough (Enough)
Now I'm givin' myself nothin' but love (But l-l-love)
'Cause I know that I am worth it (Yeah, yeah)
I know ain't nobody perfect (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I am blessed by the heavens
Someone's got a hold on me
Sweet, but I get rough, just what I wanna be
What I wanna be, just what I wanna be
I don't know you, but
I am blessed by the heavens
Someone's got a hold on me
Sweet, but I get rough, just what I wanna be
What I wanna be, just what I wanna be
I don't know you, but I'm just what I wanna be

[Post-Chorus: Meghan Trainor & Nicki Minaj]
Nice to meet ya
Nice to meet ya
Nice to meet ya
Nice to meet ya, rrrr

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Who you gon' call when you ain't got the, uh
Me and Meghan run up in the spot like, uh
I pop off 'cause I am the reigning champ
Please no comparisons 'cause you know they can't
Had to cut the grass, there was snakes in the camp
They know I'm the billy, I be laughin'
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
One minute, I'm nice, the next, a monster
My guest house alone cost like three tickets
And that Rolls truck and that paint job real wicked
Used to dumb, dumb myself down for these chickens
Now when dumb-dumb talk, I smile, it be crickets
Boom, I turn every head when I walk in the room
Pretty in real life, hit my pics with the zoom
A ten when they rate her like tomb
Elevator to the penthouse, we ain't stoppin' anytime soon

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
Oh, yeah
Blessed by the heavens
Someone's got a hold on me
Sweet, but I get rough, just what I wanna be
What I wanna be, just what I wanna be
I don't know you, but I'm just what I wanna be

[Post-Chorus: Meghan Trainor, Both & Nicki Minaj]
Nice to meet ya (Ah, ah, ah)
Nice to meet ya (Oh, mmm)
Nice to meet ya (Oh, Ooh)
Nice to meet ya
