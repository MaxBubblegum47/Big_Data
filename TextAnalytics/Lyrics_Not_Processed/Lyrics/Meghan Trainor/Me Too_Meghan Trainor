[Intro]
Ow!

[Verse 1]
Who's that sexy thing I see over there?
That's me, standin' in the mirror
What's that icy thing hangin' 'round my neck? Mmm
That's gold, show me some respect (Oh-ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I thank God every day (Uh-huh)
That I woke up feelin' this way (Uh-huh)
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh-uh

[Chorus]
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too

[Verse 2]
I walk in like a dime piece
I go straight to VIP
I never pay for my drinks
My entourage behind me
My life's a movie, Tom Cruise
So bless me, baby, achoo
And even if they tried to
They can't do it like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I thank God every day (Thank God) (Uh-huh)
That I woke up feelin' this way (And I feel good) (Uh-huh)
And I can't help lovin' myself (Woo)
And I don't need nobody else, nuh-uh (No, no, baby)

[Chorus]
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too (Oh)
If I was you (I would wanna), I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too (Hey, hey)

[Bridge]
Ow! (Turn the bass up)
Turn the bass up
Ow! (Turn the bass up)
Let's go!

[Pre-Chorus]
I thank God every day (Said I thank God) (Uh-huh)
That I woke up feelin' this way (Uh-huh)
And I can't help lovin' myself (Ow!)
And I don't need nobody else, nuh-uh (No, no, baby)

[Chorus]
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too (Oh)
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too (Hey, hey, hey, yeah)
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
