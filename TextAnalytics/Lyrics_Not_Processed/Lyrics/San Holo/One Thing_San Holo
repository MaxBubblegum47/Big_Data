[Verse 1]
Why do I feel like I’m running
Always chasing after something
Why do I feel like I’m running
Searching all the world for 
one thing
Wandering, wandering, giving all I’ve got for one thing
Wandering, wandering
, searching all the world for one thing
Why do I feel like I’m running
Always chasing after something
Why do I feel like I’m running
Searching all the world for one thing
Wandering, wandering, giving all I’ve got for one thing
Wandering, wandering
, searching all the world for one thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Searching all the world
Searching all the world
Searching all the…
Searching all the…
Searching, search, search, search....
Searching all the world for one thing

[Chorus]
Searching all the world for one thing
Giving all I’ve got for one thing

[Verse 2]
Why do I feel like I’m running
Always chasing after something
Why do I feel like I’m running
Searching all the world for one thing
Wandering, wandering, giving all I’ve got for one thing
Wandering, wandering
, searching all the world for one thing
Why do I feel like I’m running
Always chasing after something
Why do I feel like I’m running
Searching all the world for one thing
Wandering, wandering, giving all I’ve got for one thing
Wandering, wandering
, searching all the world for one thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Searching all the world
Searching all the world
Searching all the…
Searching all the…
Searching, search, search, search....
Searching all the world for one thing

[Chorus]
Searching all the world for one thing
Giving all I’ve got for one thing
Searching all the world for one thing
Giving all I’ve got for one thing
