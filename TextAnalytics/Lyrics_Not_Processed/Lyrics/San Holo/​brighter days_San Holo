[Intro]
Oh

[Verse 1]
Vivid visions of us carry on
Think I've found the light it's been so long
I better hold on to this feeling before it's gone
Whatever happened we both grew as time moved on
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
Feels like I'm the only one
Looking at blue skies, dreaming of old times
Brighter days will come
Looking at blue skies, with you in my mind
I'm the only one, brighter days will come
Am I the only one?
Looking at blue skies, dreaming of old times

[Post-Chorus]
Dreaming of old times
Dreaming of old times

[Verse 2]
Flying higher, I'm ten feet off the ground (off the ground)
I see it all even when looking down
Don't wanna hold on to the times you were around
No longer hear you voice when there's no single sound

[Chorus]
Feels like I'm the only one
Looking at blue skies, dreaming of old times
Brighter days will come
Looking at blue skies, with you in my mind
I'm the only one, brighter days will come
Am I the only one?
Looking at blue skies, dreaming of old times

[Post-Chorus]
Dreaming of old times
Dreaming of old times

[Outro]
Brighter days, ter days, ter days, ter days will
Brighter days, ter days, ter days, ter days will
Brighter days, ter days, ter days, ter days will
Brighter days, ter days, ter days, ter days will
Brighter days will come
