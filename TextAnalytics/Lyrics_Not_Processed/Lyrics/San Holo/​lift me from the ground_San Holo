[Intro: Sofie Winterson]
Lift me from the ground

[Verse]
Talk to me, I love that sound
Out of words when you're around
I've been trying to come down
On a high when you're around
Lift me from the ground

[Verse]
Talk to me, I love that sound
Out of words when you're around
Lift me from the ground
I've been trying to come down
On a high when you're around

[Chorus]
Lift me from the ground
Lift me from the ground
Ground, ground, ground

[Post-Chorus]
Lift me from the ground
Lift me from the ground
Lift me from the ground

[Verse]
Talk to me, I love that sound
Out of words when you're around
I've been trying to come down
On a high when you're around

[Verse]
Talk to me, I love that sound
Out of words when you're around
Lift me from the ground
I've been trying to come down
On a high when you're around

[Chorus]
Lift me from the ground
Ground, ground, ground
Lift me from the ground

[Post-Chorus]
Lift me from the ground
Lift me from the ground
Lift me from the ground

[Outro]
Lift me from the ground
Lift me from the ground
