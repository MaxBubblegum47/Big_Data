[Verse 1]
I don't know why, but this feels like summertime
Out late at night, with you standing by my side
Maybe it's the lights or the walk that your skin on mine
I don't know why, but this feels like summertime

[Pre-Chorus]
When I catch you alone, just you and me
Make you my own, you're all I need
I'm here alone, just here for you
Make you my own, if you wanted to

[Chorus]
We can go to my place. Turn off all lights
No need for phone calls
Yeah, we can kill time
You know what you want, I know what I need
You want a good time
Girl, you can trust me

(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why)

[Verse 2]
I don't know why, but you look like paradise
Think it's your eyes, or your tan skin no close, for what
This was the night, and we're running out of time
I don't know why, but you look like paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
When I catch you alone, just you and me
Make you my own, you're all I need
I'm here alone, just here for you
Make you my own, if you wanted to

[Chorus]
We can go to my place. Turn off all lights
No need for phone calls
Yeah, we can kill time
You know what you want, I know what I need
You want a good time
Girl, you can trust me

(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)

(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)
(I don't know why, why, why)

[Outro]
I don't know why
