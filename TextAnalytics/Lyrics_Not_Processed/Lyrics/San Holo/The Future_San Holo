[Verse 1: James Vincent McMorrow]
I think too much
I wish the night would come
Stand there and watch
Wait till the end of longing
While everyone else
Everyone holds their lives close
I think too much
When I think about the future

[Pre-Chorus: James Vincent McMorrow]
I think too much (I think too much)
When I think about the future
I think too much (I think too much)
When I think about the future
I think too much (I think too much)
When I think about the future
I think too much (I think too much)
When I think about your future

[Chorus]
The future
The future
The future

[Verse 2: James Vincent McMorrow]
Settle a bet
Who is the fastest talker
That youâ€™ve ever met
Me or that 
vacant love
Who 
unlocked your door
And led to a shady palm grove
I think too much
When I think about your future

[Pre-Chorus: James Vincent McMorrow]
I think too much (I think too much)
When I think about the future
I think too much (I think too much)
When I think about the future
I think too much (I think too much)
When I think about the future
I think too much (I think too much)
When I think about your future

[Chorus]
The future
The future
The future

[Verse 3: James Vincent McMorrow]
So call me up
We go out
Realize
Not what you thought
Sick of luck
Sick of trying
Remind myself
When I was
Old enough
To let you down (let you down)
Run my mouth
Right through your lungs
I think too much
When I think about your future
When I think about your future
When I think about your future

[Outro]
The future
The future
The future
The future
