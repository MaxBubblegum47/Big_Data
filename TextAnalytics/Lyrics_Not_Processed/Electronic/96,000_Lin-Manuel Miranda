[USNAVI]
Ninety-six thousand!

[SONNY/BENNY]
Damn!

[USNAVI]
Ninety-six thousand!

[SONNY]
Dollars? Holler!

[USNAVI]
Ninety-six thousand!

[BENNY, spoken]
Yo, somebody won!

[USNAVI]
Ninety-six thousand!

[BENNY]
Yo,​
If I won the lotto tomorrow
Well, I know I wouldn’t bother goin’ on no spendin’ spree
I pick a business school and pay the entrance fee!
Then maybe if you’re lucky, you’ll stay friends with me!

I’ll be a businessman, richer than Nina’s daddy!
Donald Trump and I on the links, and he’s my caddy!
My money’s makin’ money, I’m goin’ from po’ to mo’ dough!
Keep the bling, I want the brass ring, like Frodo!

[USNAVI]
Oh no, here goes Mr. Braggadocio
Next thing you know, you’re lying like Pinocchio—

[BENNY]
Yo, if you’re scared of the bull, stay out the rodeo!

[GRAFFITI PETE]
Yo, I got more hoes than a phone book in Tokyo!

[USNAVI]
Ooh, you better stop rappin’, you not ready
It’s gonna get hot and heavy
And you already sweaty—

[GRAFFITI PETE]
Yo-yo-yo! Yo!

[USNAVI]
Yo! I’m sorry is that an answer?
Shut up, go home and pull ya damn pants up!
As for you, Mr. Frodo of the Shire—
96 G’s ain’t enough to retire

[BENNY]
C'mon, I’ll have enough to knock your ass off its axis!

[USNAVI]
You’ll have a knapsack full of jack after taxes!

[SONNY]
Ninety-six thousand!

[ABUELA CLAUDIA, spoken]
Ay, alabanza!

[SONNY]
Ninety-six thousand!

[DANIELA/CARLA, spoken]
No me diga!

[SONNY]
Ninety-six thousand!

[VANESSA, spoken]
I never win shit!

[SONNY]
Ninety-six thousand!

[BENNY]
For real, though, imagine how it would feel goin’ real slow
Down the highway of life with no regrets
And no breakin’ your neck for respect or a paycheck
For real, though, I’ll take a break from the wheel and we’ll throw
The biggest block party, everybody here
It’s a weekend when we can breathe, take it easy

[NEIGHBORS]
Yo! Ma, it’s me, check my tickets!

[CARLA]
Check one two three
What would you do with ninety-six G’s—

[DANIELA]
Who me?

[CARLA]
I mean if it’s just between you and me—

[DANIELA]
Esa pregunta es tricky!

[CARLA]
I know

[DANIELA]
With ninety-six G’s
I’d start my life with a brand new lease
Atlantic City with a Malibu Breeze

[CARLA]
And a brand new weave!

[DANIELA]
Or maybe just bleach...

[VANESSA]
Y’all are freaks.​

[USNAVI, spoken]
Yo, I’m just sayin’...

(sung)
It’s silly when we get into these crazy hypotheticals
You really want some bread? Then go ahead create a set of goals
And cross them off the list as you pursue ‘em
And with those ninety-six, I know precisely what I’m doin’

[VANESSA]
What'chu doin’?

[USNAVI]
What’m I doin? What’m I doin?
It takes most of that cash just to save my ass from financial ruin
Sonny can keep the coffee brewin’
I’ll spend a few on you
‘Cause  the only room with a view is a room with you in it

And I could give Abuela Claudia the rest of it
Just fly me down to Puerto Plata, I’ll make the best of it!
You really love this business?

[SONNY]
No

[USNAVI]
Tough, Merry Christmas
You’re now the youngest tycoon in Washington Hiznits!

[SONNY]
Yo!
With ninety-six thousand, I’d finally fix housin’
Give the barrio computers with wireless web browsin’
Your kids are livin’ without a good edjumication
Change the station, teach 'em about gentrification
The rent is escalatin’

[GRAFFITI PETE]
What?!

[SONNY]
The rich are penetratin’

[GRAFFITI PETE]
What?!

[SONNY]
We pay our corporations when we should be demonstratin’

[GRAFFITI PETE]
What?!

[SONNY]
What about immigration?

[GRAFFITI PETE]
What?!

[SONNY]
Politicians be hatin’

[GRAFFITI PETE]
What?!

[SONNY]
Racism in this nation’s gone from latent to blatant

[COMMUNITY]
Oooooh!

[SONNY]
I’ll cash my ticket and picket, invest in protest
Never lose my focus 'til the city takes notice
And you know this man! I'll never sleep
Because the ghetto has a million promises for me to keep!

[VANESSA, spoken]
You are so cute!

[SONNY, spoken]
I was just thinking off the top of my head.​

[USNAVI, spoken]
Ninety-six K: Go.​

[VANESSA]
If I win the lottery, you’ll never see me again

[USNAVI]
Damn, we only jokin’, stay broke then

[VANESSA]
I’ll be downtown
Get a nice studio, I'll get out of the barrio

[VANESSA]
If I
​win the
​​lottery

You’ll wonder where
I’ve been

[BENNY]
