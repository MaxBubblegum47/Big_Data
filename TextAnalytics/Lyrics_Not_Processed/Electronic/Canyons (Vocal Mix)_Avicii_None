[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Hey, feeling light
Got me feeling so hot like a summer night
Didn't know all this time you were already mine
Got me feeling so lost gazing in your eyes

[Verse]
Oh, baby I'm so down
Let's run away, get out of this town
Oh, always feeling down, but when you smile everything is alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Hmm hmm
All the stars are aligning for me tonight
Hmm hmm
Both of our worlds begin to collide
Hmm hmm
All the stars are aligning for me tonight
Hmm Hmm
Both of our worlds begin to collide

[Chorus]
Oh I still can't get out
Should my heart surrender
You found me, found me, found me

[Intrumental Bridge]
You found me

Oh, always feeling down, but when you smile everything is alright

Both of our worlds begin to collide

All the stars are aligning for me tonight
Hmm Hmm

Oh I still can't get out
Should my heart surrender
You found me, found me, found me

You found me
