[Verse 1]
Feels like I'm flying
Wings made of light
Brand new and shining
Like a shot rung out through the night

[Pre-Chorus]
A heart that beats an incredible machine
Made of blood, and love, and hope, and lust, and steam

[Chorus]
Calling
Calling
Calling

[Verse 2]
Feels like I'm floating
Weightless in flight
Light that's exploding
As a soul and gravity fight

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Lifted higher mercury skies above
Calling
Water, fire burning a sight of love

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
