[Verse 1: Nasty C]
They told me everybody's 15 minutes in a different timezone
And since I have it at the moment, you the one I wanna shine my light on
Get your life, get your life, little mama, won't you get your life on?
Ain't nothing cooler than the wrong moves, when you do 'em to the right song, the right song
Let's shoot this movie and put the shit on repeat
I hope this Mary's not making you fall asleep
Before we hit the road, put our phones on silent
Nobody's tryna bring sand to the beach
What would it take to change your plans for the weekend?
'Cause I am tryna kick it like EA
The whole thing, the pre-party, the pre-sex
Now we hit the Major League where the G's at
