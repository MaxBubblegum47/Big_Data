[Verse 1]
I received a message from my brother across the water
He sat laughing as he wrote, "The end's in sight"
So I said goodbye to all my friends
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox
Because I know it's time to fly

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, come on, meet me in the morning
Meet me in the middle of the night
Ah, yeah, the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright?
Ooh yeah, ah hah

[Verse 2]
I just jumped a train that never stops
So now somehow I know I'll never finish paying for my ride
Someone pushed a gun into my hand
Tell me I'm the type of man
To fight the fight without inquiring

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah-ha come on, meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night, yeah?
Oh, well, the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright?

[Verse 3]
Oh, mama, well, I think it's time I'm leaving
Nothing here to make me stay
Whoa, mama, well, it must be time I'm going
They're knocking down them doors
They're trying to take me away
Please, Mr. Brakeman, won't you ring your bell
And ring it loud and clear?
Please, Mr. Fireman, won't you ring your bell?
Tell the people they got to fly away from here

[Verse 4]
Ohh, I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby
Southern lady, had a very, very special smile
We are in the middle of a change in destination
When the train stops, all together we will smile

[Chorus]
Oh, come on, come on now, meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, n-n-night?
Oh, oh yeah, everybody know the morning time is coming
Don't it make you wanna feel alright? Ah, ah, yeah
Make me feel alright
Fly now, baby
Get to fly, yeah
Fly now, baby
Oooh, hey hey
Uh, uh, uh, uh
