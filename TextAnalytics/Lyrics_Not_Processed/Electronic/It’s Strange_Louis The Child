[Verse 1: K. Flay]
Heart been so cold that I don't feel at all
Scarred up inside, so I built all these walls
My head rolling back, but I'm faking the rush
And out every night and I'm lonely as fuck

[Pre-Chorus: K. Flay]
I make my own rules and my own plans
I got no room for no man
That's my way, that's my way
Then I saw you in a dream, right
I wanna call you, a kind of feeling
I can't name, I can't name

[Chorus: K. Flay]
It's strange
But I don't need space from you
And every single thing you do, I like
I've been chaste
Maybe I just knew I had to wait for you
Draw a knife and carve a little space for you
It feels nice

[Hook: K. Flay]
It's strange, but I don't need space from you
And every single thing you do, I like

[Verse 2: K. Flay]
Opened me up, I let down my defense
I swore that I wouldn't go falling again
I could be faded with somebody new
I rather be sober at home, just us two

[Pre-Chorus: K. Flay]
I make my own rules, and my own plans
I got no room for no man
That's my way, that's my way
Then I saw you in a dream, right
I wanna call you, a kind of feeling
I can't name, I can't name

[Chorus: K. Flay]
It's strange
But I don't need space from you
And every single thing you do, I like
I've been changed
Maybe I just knew I had to wait for you
Draw a knife and carve a little space for you
It feels nice

[Outro: K. Flay]
I make my own rules, and my own plans
I got no room for no man
That's my way, that's my way
Then I saw you in a dream, right
I wanna call you, a kind of feeling
I can't name, I can't name
