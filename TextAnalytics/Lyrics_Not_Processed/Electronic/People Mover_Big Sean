[Intro]
28 grams later

[Chorus: Pat Piff]
D.O.T. bus number nine
In these streets, never on time
Can we get the people moving?
Yeah, I'm the people mover
Can we get the people moving?
Let me take the people mover
D.O.T. bus number nine
In these streets, never on time
Can we get the people moving?
Yeah, I'm the people mover
Can we get the people moving?
Let me take the people mover

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Big Sean
You can't fight this with no matches
I'm enlightened and I'm nicest
As an [?]
Call Mastercard cause he priceless, you can't buy this
They wanna turn around and ask me how life is
Its tee-riffic, the American Dream?
He is it, he lives it
He get the people moving like they evicted
I spit C.L. smooth over that beat box
Then get a verse from Piff, now that's Pete Rock
And since I got my advance and O made a couple grand
I'll never stand there on that deep dot
I guess this life was made to be
I wasn't made for the world, it was made for me
Where everybody feel a nigga like they raping me
But I'ma be on by the next train home

[Chorus: Pat Piff]
D.O.T. bus number nine
In these streets, never on time
Can we get the people moving?
Yeah, I'm the people mover
Can we get the people moving?
Let me take the people mover
D.O.T. bus number nine
In these streets, never on time
Can we get the people moving?
Yeah, I'm the people mover
Can we get the people moving?
Let me take the people mover

[Verse 2: Pat Piff]
I'm MC so cozy
Household name like the furniture mane
Shouts to House Shoes and Dilla, all day
I spit crack nigga, I've been dealin' all day, ay
Anybody can get it like minimum wage
So give me that mic let me get on the stage
Vibe with it if you feeling it, ayy
If not you can skip it like some of the twelfth grade
Think I've been spittin' since maybe the sixth grade
Wishing these niggas would listen is my aim
Shitted on the game like birds over stadiums
I'm a playboy at the Palladium
People mover young Piff, no train
At been the same since I seen Soul Plane
Cause we all gotta leave someday
I pray that I miss like he got no aim

[Chorus: Pat Piff]
D.O.T. bus number nine
In these streets, never on time
Can we get the people moving?
Yeah, I'm the people mover
Can we get the people moving?
Let me take the people mover
D.O.T. bus number nine
In these streets, never on time
Can we get the people moving?
Yeah, I'm the people mover
Can we get the people moving?
Let me take the people mover
