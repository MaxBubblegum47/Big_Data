[Verse 1: KUČKA]
We pulled into the back road
Shimmering this way forth
Wearing out its course end, I could only dream about
What is hidden, heard through its white noise

[Chorus]
All seems too clear
Let it wash over me
Don't disappear
Visions are hyperreal
All seems too clear
Let it wash over me
Don't deserve it
Visions are hyperreal

[Verse 2: KUČKA]
Rising from the vapour misted patterns, voices left behind
From the vapour misted patterns, can we stay a while?
Guess I'm sick of things being the same
Doesn't have to be every day, never change
Just recycling things I thought were true when I was younger
But I'm older now, I should've listened, oh
The splinters left me blind, I had to change my mind

[Chorus: KUČKA]
But constantly, it all seems too clear
Let it wash over me
Don't disappear
Visions are hyperreal
Let it wash over me
Don't deserve it
Visions are hyperreal

[Outro: KUČKA]
Voices left behind
Rising from the vapour mist
Can we stay a while?
Voices left behind
