[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Remember when I told you
"No matter where I go
I'll never leave your side
You will never be alone"
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home

[Verse 1: Conor Maynard]
I could never let you go
Couldn't run away if I tried
'Cause even when I'm all alone
You still got a hold on my mind
And I'll always let you know
That I'm always gonna hold on

[Pre-Chorus: Conor Maynard]
And I told you right from the start
You just say the word and I'll go
No, it doesn't matter how far
'Cause your love is all that I know
Baby you just stay where you are
And you know I won't be too long
Hold on
Hold on

[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Remember when I told you
"No matter where I go
I'll never leave your side
You will never be alone"
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home

[Verse 2: SHAUN]
조용히 잠든 방을 열어 기억을 꺼내 들어
부서진 시간 위에서 선명히 너는 떠올라
길 잃은 마음속에 널 가둔 채 살아
그만 그만

[Chorus: SHAUN]
멈춘 시간 속 잠든 너를 찾아가
아무리 막아도 결국 너의 곁인 걸
길고 긴 여행을 끝내 이젠 돌아가
너라는 집으로 지금 다시 way back home

[Bridge: SHAUN & Conor Maynard]
세상을 뒤집어 찾으려 해
오직 너로 완결된 이야기를
No, I won't ever lose
As long as you're there
빛이 다 꺼진 여기 나를 안아줘

[Chorus: SHAUN & Conor Maynard]
눈을 감으면 소리 없이 밀려와
이 마음 그 위로 넌 또 한 겹 쌓여가
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home
