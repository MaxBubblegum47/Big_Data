Too mix up in drama to go outside
Too mix up in drama to free my mind
Jealous people around me, I need to change my life
I just turn colder every time I try
What would I do without you, my chargie?
I don't feel that way with anybody
Tell me your secrets, I'm not messy
Steady it for me, girl, hold steady
I wanna put you in my life
Your hair smell like the tropics, your body look nice
One fuck cyaan hold me, we gotta go twice
I'm here for you, just tell me what you like
I wanna put you in my life

[Chorus: Wizkid]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, come closer
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, come closer
