[Chorus: King Chip]
I'm feeling experimental
Just popped two now what have I gotten into
Trying to cope with all this shit I been through
These substances is fucking with my mental, my mental
I'm so experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking my mental

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
(Trippy niggas, trippy)
Big blunts of that kush, ducked off in that Phantom
Canâ€™t no nigga do like me, this life I live outlandish
Bunch of hoes in my mansion, get trippy of them bars
I don't do no handcuffing; toss 'em to my dawgs
Bout' to start a bank, all this money that I make
Sour diesel smoking, Memphis nigga getting paid
Bunch of bad bitches, beggin' Juice to fuck
Drinking 'til I throw up, smoking 'til I'm stuck
Loud kush, you can hear it when I walk by
The room is moving side to side, I'm feeling hypnotized
Getting faded in the Phantom, ain't no stopping a riot
These niggas smoking dirt, actin' like they high

[Chorus: King Chip]
I'm feeling experimental
Just popped two now what have I gotten into
Trying to cope with all this shit I been through
These substances is fucking with my mental, my mental
I'm so experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking my mental

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
(Yup, yup, boi)
Rollin' weed while I'm sexin', rollin' weed while I drive
Rollin' weed while I'm rollin' weed, gettin' high when I'm high
I be gettin' high when I'm hot, gettin' high when you not
Gettin' high, on the low, gettin' high, oh my god!
I just ate a edible, edible
Swear to god I feel incredible
Swear that my texting is no longer legible
I got the pussy you put on the pedestal
Tell her to leave and come bring me back revenue
Gettin' paid down down down to the decimal
Medical vegetable, I'm so professional
My life's a fesitval, I'm just so messed up though - in the mental
I feel like I just jumped out the window
Rollin' OG, kush, purp and indo
Right here, outdoor, in the endo
Weed is my crescendo
Okay, so now we rollin', and she just popped her a pilly
Got her feeling all silly, rollin' paper from Philly, whoa

[Chorus: King Chip]
I'm feeling experimental
Just popped two now what have I gotten into
Trying to cope with all this shit I been through
These substances is fucking with my mental, my mental
I'm so experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking my mental

[Verse 3: King Chip]
She asking me questions even though she know I don't know
Her pussy the best and she give the best blowjobs on blow
She love the way that I dress and the way that I stroke
She said she never sipped lean, I said I never did coke
I'm good, I'm smokin', I'm leanin', I'm trying to stay focused
Got my loc's on the chieffin', hope these mollies ain't bogus
We got hoes in the front, got lean in the back
Gettin' head in the back, got fix in the 'Lac
Got Xannies on deck
Bitch, take these shots to the neck, we gots to connect
We off in this club, purple Sprites like it's nothing
Bitch just told me she ain't coming home with me less we fucking
And she got a friend, and they got some mans
Please don't mention yo nigga because I don't care about yo man
Now me and two hoes we on
Let's eat these shrooms 'til they gone
Now we having a threesome in the whip on the way home

[Chorus: King Chip]
I'm feeling experimental
Just popped two now what have I gotten into
Trying to cope with all this shit I been through
These substances is fucking with my mental, my mental
I'm so experimental
Just popped two, now what have I gotten into
These substances is fucking with my mental
Fucking my mental
