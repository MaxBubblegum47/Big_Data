[Verse 1]
High tail in your face
Black hole rockin' the place
Hong Kong videos
Big bang, mad to blow, yeah

[Chorus]
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Look out, I'm gonna rage

[Verse 2]
Eight ball in the pack
Big bone, jukebox Jack
Hot star burnin' it up
Full moon runnin' amok, yeah

[Chorus]
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Look out, I'm gonna rage
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Gotta get out, get out of this place
Blow a big hole into cyberspace
Gotta get out, get out of this place
Blow a big hole into cyberspace, yeah
Cyberspace

[Verse 3]
Well, octane down the track
Flat chat smash the mach
Blow out, burnin' hot
Mile high, take you right to the top

[Chorus]
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Look out, you gotta let me out
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Look out, you gotta race
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Blow you
Blow you
Blow you into cyberspace
