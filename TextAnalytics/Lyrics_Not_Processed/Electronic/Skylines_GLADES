[Verse 1]
Say you'll hold me
Say you'll hold me till' we're
Old and lonely, you can take the pain away
It'll only better
More than you can say now
Be more careful
So no one and won't be hold in place

[Chorus]
Skylines are burning in between
Tonight we're long lost love
Skylines are burning in between us
You and I are run free, run free
I'm running, running, oh
It's too late now, we can't go back, we're breaking
I'm fighting for me, oh
You had your say, now go away, it's over

[Verse 2]
Take this moment
Put a silence on it
Wait together, driving right past memory lane
Say no goodbyes, cause I'm right here with you
Holding your heart 'til we're old and lonely

[Chorus]
Skylines are burning in between
Tonight we're long lost love
Skylines are burning in between us
You and I are run free, run free
I'm running, running, oh
It's too late now, we can't go back, we're breaking
I'm fighting for me, oh
You had your say now, go away, it's over

[Bridge]
Hold me close and never let go
Beat my heart again
Take me with you, get me away from here
Hold me close and never let go
Beat my heart again
Take me with you, get me away from here

[Chorus]
I'm running, running, oh
It's too late now, we can't go back, we're breaking
I'm fighting for me, oh
You had your say now go away it's over
I'm running, running, oh
It's too late now, we can't go back, we're breaking
I'm fighting for me, oh
You had your say, now go away, it's over
