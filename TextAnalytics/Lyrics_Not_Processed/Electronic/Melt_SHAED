What’s the difference if it’s all good
What’s the difference if I’m all tied up now

I’ll get used to it all
Guess I’m taking the fall
What’s the difference if I can’t get up now

No it wasn’t right to pretend you were the light


Can’t tell my feelings from my bones

Wait
Now you’re dressing me in chains
Callin every move I make
Now you’re beggin me to smile, but I can’t fake
Thought the point was to create
I can barely feel myself
Like I’m frozen in the ice
Wish I could melt

What’s the difference if it’s all good honey
Try to float but it’s too cold and heavy
Sinking down ever more
Can’t get up from the floor
What’s the difference if I’m all messed up now

No it wasn’t right to pretend you were the light
Can’t tell my feelings from my bones


Bones, bones, bones

Wait
Now you’re dressing me in chains
Callin every move I make
Now you’re beggin me to smile, but I can’t fake
Thought the point was to create
I can barely feel myself
Like I’m frozen in the ice
Wish I could melt
Wish I could melt
