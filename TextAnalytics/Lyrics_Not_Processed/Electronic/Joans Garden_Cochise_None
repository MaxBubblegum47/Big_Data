Ballin' like I play for the Heat (Play for the Heat, ah)
Ain't no way that boy can compete (Can compete, uh)
He don't got a shot, that boy weak, yeah (That boy weak, uh)

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh, I'm in the back, uh, uh, give me the cash
Uh, uh, filled to the brim, uh, uh, give me the cash
My money comin' through long in a sack
Get 'em upset 'cause they ain't move bag
Heat that boy up I ain't talkin' bout temp'
I feel like I'm pimpin', I ain't talkin' trash
What's even wrong? I gotta get cash
Forty years old, I'll still hit the dash
I know it's tragic, that boy, he cappin'
Don't know what happened but I know what's happenin'
My homie trappin', he got a knack, yeah (
Get it
)
That boy he cappin', that boy he flackin'
He not with action, ball like a Maverick
Caught that boy lackin', he was like "Stop this"
I'm bein' honest, I'm not with all this
And then he ran like he Sonic, then my money go up
I just wanna know, do you wanna go? (Come on)
Maybe Mexico, you with me the most
Nobody say nothin', I wanna go (
Get it
)
