[Monologue]
There's multiple types of love
I think the nicest kind is, of course, is, the deepest kind
I think I felt it, but it's not......
It's like something that's constant
It comes and goes, for me at least
I still love people I'm not with
It just transforms into a different kind
It’s just my dumb opinion i don’t know anything
But that's cool, I like not knowing
I think life would be dull if you knew everything
I cherish anything that feels real at least in the moment
Because I think we live in a world where a lot of things aren't...
Very real
