[Verse 1]
Humdinger, bell ringer
Got a nasty stinger, to slow you down
Mud slinger, gold digger
Who point the finger, an' do you down
Kicking and a-fighting on the T.V. show
Lightnin', blindin' in the middle of the road

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you coming in?
Are you coming in?
I said

[Chorus]
Come into the house of
Come into the house of
Come into the house of jazz
Come into the house of
Come into the house of
Come into the house of jazz
Yes

[Verse 2]
Pole stripper, big tipper
Got a slappin' tickler, to make you groan
A-spittin' and a-bitin' on the T.V. show
Tightenin', fightin' and givin' out her love

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Are you coming in?
Ya come on in

[Solo]

Well, are you coming in?
Are you coming in?
I said

[Chorus 1] (x2)
