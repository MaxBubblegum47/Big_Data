[Intro]
Just keepin' it honest
You wouldn't want a young nigga if I wasn't whippin' this foreign
That's why I came back, top down

[Pre-Chorus]
You gon' have to do more than just (Say it)
You gon' have to do less when you (Do it)
So mama you know I (Show it)
Always want you to (Prove it)
You gon' have to do more than just (Say it)
You gon' have to do less when you (Do it)
So mama you know I (Show it)
So you gon' need to more than just (Prove it)

[Chorus]
And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car, let it go
And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car, let you know

[Verse 1]
How you know that I want you?
And you want me?
But I now know
You know I know that this ain't right
'Cause you want me cause I got dough
Ever since you walked in inside my foreign, slam my door
You know I know that you been on it
But I been on it on the low

[Bridge]
So let a young nigga get down on it, yeah
Love when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though a young nigga want you
Shawty, I promise the truth
And when I come down on it, yeah
You love when I'm down on it, yeah
Fuck around, spend time on it, yeah
That's why I came back top down

And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car, let you know

[Verse 2]
Gots to break it down for you to let you know
You know it's things you know I’m down for
Ain't gon' act like you ain't 'bout my dough
You know I know, but girl, you know I'm down for
Take your time to find you
I won't hesitate to take the time to waste, no, baby
Bringin' out the foreign out to play
You know it’s things it takes

[Bridge]
So let a young nigga get down on it, yeah
Love when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though a young nigga want you

Fuck around, spend time on it, yeah

[Outro]
Say it, baby, do it, baby
Show it, baby, prove it, baby
Say it, baby, do it, baby

All I wanna do is come close to you
You make me come through, I get so close to you
