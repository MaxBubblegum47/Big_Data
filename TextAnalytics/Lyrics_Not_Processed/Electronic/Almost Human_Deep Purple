[Verse 1]
I know you're the only one who understands
Afore ye go, before you leave
You always shake my hand
Even when I'm crazy, on fire and naked
Just as Nature intended
No style but easily blended

[Bridge]
You always know where I'll be found
Hanging somewhere near the ground
Help me up or help me down

[Chorus]
Don't want to lose those days
When everything is just a haze
I'm dreaming

[Verse 2]
I believe I could walk before I learned to crawl
When I look up, the Devil's looking back
From the mirror on the wall
You can open the door
Got my feet stuck to the floor
I may have lost my way
But I didn't get where I am today

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You spin into my empty room
And once again I'm almost human
Almost human
