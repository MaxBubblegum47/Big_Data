[Verse 1]
Wakin' up, I see that everything is okay
The first time in my life, and now it's so great
Slowin' down, I look around and I am so amazed
I think about the little things that make life great

[Pre-Chorus]
I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

[Chorus]
This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

[Verse 2]
I found a place so safe, not a single tear
The first time in my life and now it's so clear
Feel calm, I belong, I'm so happy here
It's so strong and now I let myself be sincere

[Pre-Chorus]
I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

[Chorus]
This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
'Cause I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

[Bridge]
It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreamin'
It's the happiness inside that you're feelin'
It's so beautiful, it makes you wanna cry
It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreamin'
It's the happiness inside that you're feelin'
It's so beautiful, it makes you wanna cry
It's so beautiful, it makes you wanna cry

[Chorus]
This innocence is brilliant
It makes you wanna cry
This innocence is brilliant
Please don't go away
'Cause I need you now
And I'll hold on to it (It's so beautiful, it makes you wanna cry)
Don't you let it pass you by

[Chorus]
This innocence is brilliant (It's so beautiful, it's so beautiful)
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now (It makes me wanna cry)
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
