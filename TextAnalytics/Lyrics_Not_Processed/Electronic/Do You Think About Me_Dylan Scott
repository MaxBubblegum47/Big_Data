[Verse 1]
We roll into town around nine or ten
Hang out with all of our friends
On the hood of our cars
In a Walmart parking lot
Everybody in the town knew
That was our spot

[Verse 2]
But what they didn't know
Is where we would go
And kill the headlights
On a backroad
And turn the radio to something real slow

[Chorus]
I still think about you
Do you think about me?
"Strawberry Wine," we were seventeen
And that was our song all summer long
And to this day, every time it comes on
I think about you
Do you think about me?

[Verse 3]
I still go back in my mind sometimes
It puts me back under that July sky
Riding around with you, girl, my, my, my
I wonder why, why, why
We said goodbye

[Verse 4]
Some things are meant to go together
That's me and you
But some things aren't meant to last forever
That's me and you too

[Chorus]
I still think about you
Do you think about me?
"Strawberry Wine," we were seventeen
And that was our song all summer long
And to this day, every time it comes on
I think about you
Do you think about me?
I still think about you
Do you think about

[Bridge]
Picking you up
Taking you out
Holding your hand
And driving around
We'd park that truck
I'd taste those lips
Get caught up
In that midnight bliss
I think about you and the way you'd look
And the way you'd laugh
And the way you'd sit there in my lap
We'd talk about forever at seventeen
People change, leave their town
Life goes on, the world goes 'round
But I still think it's meant to be

[Chorus]
I still think about you
Do you think about me?
"Strawberry Wine," we were seventeen
And that was our song all summer long
And to this day, every time it comes on
I think about you
Do you think about me?
Cause I still think about you
Do you think about me?
