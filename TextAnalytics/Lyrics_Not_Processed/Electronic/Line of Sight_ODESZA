[Verse 1]
I'm facing back to front
Over my shoulder at the sun
And it's an open door
End of my line of sight once more

[Chorus]
And I don't learn, no, I don't learn
It'll all be fine this time
And I don't learn, no, I don't learn
'Cause you always seemed so kind
And I don't learn, no, I don't learn
It'll all be fine this time
And I don't learn, no, I don't learn

[Post-Chorus]
Not anymore, not anymore
You know I don't learn, you know I don't learn
Not anymore, not any- not anymore
You know I don't learn, you know I don't learn

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling in and out
I turn full circle 'round and 'round
So will you help me down?
Come grab my hand for solid ground

[Chorus]
And I don't learn, no, I don't learn
It'll all be fine this time
And I don't learn, no, I don't learn
'Cause you always seemed so kind
And I don't learn, no, I don't learn
It'll all be fine this time
And I don't learn, no, I don't learn

[Post-Chorus]
Not anymore, not anymore
You know I don't learn, you know I don't learn
Not anymore, not any- not anymore
You know I don't learn, you know I don't learn
Not any-
I-I-I don't learn

[Outro]
Help me out, don’t let me down
I could learn from you
I could learn from you
Help me out, don’t let me down
I could learn from you
I could learn from you
Oh, help me out, don't let me down
I could learn from you
I could learn from you
