[Chorus]
Its a ritual non-fictional miracle
Biblical pinnacle tabanakalum syn-dium
Abolical demons with multiple tentacles
Shits real but similar to trippin' on chemicals
Successful summonin' im cummunin'
Walls crumbling, tumbling, its the fuckin' end
Ouija, Ouija the world's new leader
Jeepers creepers kneel to allegiance
It's the season of mime health freezin'
Heavens burnin' all of y'all people disseasoned
Yeah, you suckers are doomed
Since I popped up in this room

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm gonna fucking kill you, I'm gonna fucking kill you
I'm fucking satan I'm gonna kill everybody in this room
I'm gonna destroy this whole room, I'm gonna kill everybody in the whole room
I'm fucking satan you fucked up
You fucking fucked up I'm gonna kill everbody right now
