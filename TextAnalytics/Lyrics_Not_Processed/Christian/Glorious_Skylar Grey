[Verse 1: Macklemore]
You know I'm back, like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight
, 
I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in (Been going in)
Since we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things, they don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like "Woo, that boy got bars"
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came, woo

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious
