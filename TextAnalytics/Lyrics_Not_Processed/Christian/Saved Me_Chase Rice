[Verse 1]
Most of the time, I can't shut my damn mouth
And most of the time, my heart's too proud
I push 'em away, quick as they came
A living run away
And most of my life, I've lived on the dark side
And most of my nights, I smoke or drink too much
I've broken hearts once or twice
This time it feels like

[Chorus]
Living on the edge, falling fast and hard
And finally, your life, it ain't falling apart
Like a clock striking midnight you never saw coming
But it's right on time, and it stops you running
Leave it to me to play the fool
Who thinks numbing the pain makes you bulletproof
It takes hell and a lie to lead to the truth
But letting go of all of that means holding onto you

[Verse 2]
Ain't too many bridges that I ain't burned
Ain't too many reasons you should be here
It's either luck or God, and I don't care
Whoever's there heard my prayers

[Chorus]
Living on the edge, falling fast and hard
And finally, your life, it ain't falling apart
Like a clock striking midnight you never saw coming
But it's right on time, and it stops you running
Leave it to me to play the fool
Who thinks numbing the pain makes you bulletproof
It takes hell and a lie to lead to the truth
And letting go of all of that means holding onto you
I'm holding onto you

[Bridge]
It's almost like you were sent here to save me
And you saved me

[Chorus]
Living on the edge, falling fast and hard
And finally, your life, it ain't falling apart
Like a clock striking midnight you never saw coming
But it's right on time, and it stops you running
Leave it to me to play the fool
Who thinks numbing the pain makes you bulletproof
It takes hell and a lie to lead to the truth
But letting go of all of that means holding onto you
I'm holding onto you

[Outro]
It's almost like you were sent here to save me
And you saved me
