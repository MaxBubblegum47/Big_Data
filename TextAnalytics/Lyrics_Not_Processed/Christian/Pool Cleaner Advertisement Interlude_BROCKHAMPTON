[Interlude]
Hey, this is Davy, with, uh, Davy's, uh-uh, Pool Clâ€”Pool Heater and Cleaner cool spots and I just wanted to throw a little ad out here. Um, when we have a new hydro cleaner and it's impeccable and does great wonders for your pool and spa. I think, uh, well I don't necessarily mean spa, but you know. Hot tubs, and such as that. But uh, yeah go get it. It's on the market. Right now, you can get it at your local Lowe's or your local Home Depot or your local Home Improvement, anything such. Maybe some of the local businesses might have it here in the California area. But, uh, yeah, I'm over here, I'm on, uh, eighty thee Gravy street just waiting to see, but anyway... Uh, thanks for letting me on the show, I appreciate it and hopefully you guys will go get that hydro cleaner and it'll do wonders for you, and it'll-it'll just brighten up the summertime. And I know summer's coming to an end soon, but you know hot tubs are year-round for me..."
