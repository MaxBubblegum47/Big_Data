[Verse 1]
I ain't got no time, no
'Cause when this day is done
I still got shit to run
I could make it for you
'Cause you're so beautiful
I'd rather drink you up

[Chorus]
Honey, on your knees when you look at me
I'm dressed like a fucking queen and you're begging, "please"
I rule with the velvet tongue
And my dress undone
And I'll get you lost but I'm having fun
Holy, holy, holy, yeah
Holy, holy, holy, holy

[Verse 2]
'Cause I could lose it all
Can't watch it fade to black
Can't let it end like that
'Cause I got power over
Won't let it all fall down
I got my guards all around

[Chorus]
Honey, on your knees when you look at me
I'm dressed like a fucking queen and you're begging, "please"
I rule with the velvet tongue
And my dress undone
And I'll get you lost but I'm having fun
Holy, holy, holy, yeah
Holy, holy, holy

[Bridge]
What I'm saying, saying
What I'm saying to you
What I'm saying, saying
What I'm saying

[Chorus]
(Holy) Honey, on your knees when you look at me (holy)
I'm dressed like a fucking queen and you're begging, "please"
I rule with the velvet tongue (holy)
And my dress undone
And I'll get you lost but I'm having fun
Holy, holy, holy, yeah
Holy, holy, holy
