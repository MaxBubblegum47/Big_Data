[Verse 1]
Ain’t no surprise that I can’t sleep tonight
My only vice is standing by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
So won’t you love me better?
I’m waiting here, I need you now
Gravity can’t hold us down
So just take me there to higher ground

[Chorus]
Save me, I’m holding onto you
My soul is fading, I’m falling into blue
Why don’t you save me?
My blood is running cold
So lift me up and give me higher ground

[Verse 2]
Would you give me shelter? I need you now
If you lead, I’ll follow, I’m reaching out

[Pre-Chorus]
So won’t you love me better?
I’m waiting here, I need you now
Gravity can’t hold us down
So just take me there
So won’t you love me better?
I’m waiting here, I need you now
Gravity can’t hold us down
So just take me there to higher ground

[Chorus]
Save me, I’m holding onto you
My soul is fading, I’m falling into blue
Why don’t you save me?
My blood is running cold
So lift me up and give me higher ground
