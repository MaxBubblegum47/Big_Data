[Verse 1]
I'm just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm
I'm just gonna walk home kicking stones at parked cars
But I had a great night, 'cause you kept rubbing against my arm
I'm just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm

[Chorus]
Get me a drink, I get drunk off one sip, just so I can adore you
I want the entire street out of town just so I can be alone with you
Now go when you're ready
My head's getting heavy, pressed against your arm
I adore you

[Verse 2]
All of my money is spent on these nights, just so we can hang out
Spacing in and out of your dresses, I wanna be found by you
Found by you

[Chorus]
Get me a drink, I get drunk off one sip, just so I can adore you
I want the entire street out of town just so I can be alone with you
Now go when you're ready
My head's getting heavy, pressed against your arm
I adore you, I adore you

[Bridge]
She kicks the gutter in tight shorts, basketball courts
Watch me, watch her talk to boys
I'm known as a right-hand slugger
Anybody else wanna touch my lover?

[Chorus]
Get me a drink, I get drunk off one sip, just so I can adore you
I want the entire street out of town just so I can be alone with you
Now go when you're ready
My head's getting heavy, pressed against your arm
Just to adore you, I adore you
