[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

[Post-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah
I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah

[Verse 1: Joba]
It doesn't rain in L.A
And I'm afraid to see your face
Flashback to the flash floods
And the slow-paced Texas days
We never change, no no
Forever was just a phase
I didn't mean to leave you lonely
I just had to do what's best for me, selfishly
I'll admit that
I'm in a fetal hold, I'm a weak man
I'm a weak man
I hit the ground running
Trippin' on my feet
As the distance between us
Became more than I can see
I hope you're okay
Yeah, I hope you're okay
I went to the beach yesterday
And cried 'cause I missed you
The waves don't crash the same
And the sun still burns me

[Bridge 1: Joba]
I'll miss you for all my life
I'll love you for all my life
I'll miss you for all my life
I'll love you for all my life
(Another day away, another state away)
I'll miss you for all my life
(Another day away, another state away)
I'll love you for all my life
(Another day away)
I'll miss you for all my life
I'll love you for all my life

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I can't stand it here no more
I've been banging at your door
I'm so lost in Hollywood
All that shit I put you through
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, yeah
I'm so sorry
But you won't wait for someday
We had dreams, married Sunday
But I left Texas, now you hate me
In this town where I can't breathe
Yes, I love you, but I can't stay
And you ask why, but I can't say

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Still ain't find all the answers
I don't want to be standard
Surgeries, I've been tampered
Watched her fight and beat cancer
Wasn't ready to let me go
I wasn't ready for life without
Fear one day that I'll make that call
I have to face all my darkest doubts
I can scream when I think of what happens for a reason
Find my ways to fly with everyone, I lost when I'm dreaming
I don't wanna wake up when I get a chance to catch that feeling
Letting go, every second that I live until I stop breathing

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine

[Post-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy, yeah
I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy, yeah
I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy, yeah
I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy, yeah

[Bridge 2: Kevin Abstract]
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy
It's so mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy

[Verse 4: Kevin Abstract]
You made me do things I don't ever wanna do
You made me say things I don't ever wanna say
You ain't act ways that are natural
I'd rather end up in disaster
Imagine me and you outside
When the wind can't hurt my pride
Imagine me and you in a car crash
Imagine me and you shared a last laugh
Imagine me and you hold hands
Fake ass romantics
Like all the niggas we stanned
Think that's a classic, damn
You let me share your couch with you
I thank you for that
You let me share your house with you
I thank you for that
You let me wipe my mouth with you
I thank you for that
You let me write my songs about you
And I hate you for that
And I can't get it
