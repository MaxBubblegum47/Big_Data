[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
I felt awesome when you walked in
You caught me doin' something
That I should've never been caught with
I played the forest, my far trip
I tripped and I fell, still think I'm living in Austin
Remember when I was trippin' off some wack shit
When I thought the automatic had an answer?
When I was jammin' out Beyonce like Sampha
And you broke up with me 'cause I'm a Cancer?
Our relationship was toxic, cancer
I fell in love with a dancer in Atlanta
I'm lying, I ain't a Drake-ass nigga
I'm more like Troye Sivan
With a whole lotta mela-nahn
Sendin' bombs to your lawn
Grew up on Rockafella, so I'ma get a chain
And sing every song in the vain of your name
And this'll...

[Outro: bearface]
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you, I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, ooh
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you, I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, ooh
