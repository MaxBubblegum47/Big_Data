[Verse 1: Marian Hill]
1 am, you're invited
Sit by me, you gotta try this
Just light it up and take a breath
Roll it until there's nothing left
Look in my eyes
And breathe into me

[Chorus: Marian Hill]
Breathe into me
Breathe into me
Breathe into me
Breathe into me

[Verse 2: Marian Hill]
Taste my breath, do you like it?
What comes next, you decide it
Tease you with my fingertips
Play with the haste that's on my lips
Hold me closer
And breathe into me

[Chorus: Marian Hill]
Breathe into me
Breathe into me
Breathe into me
Breathe into me

[Outro: Marian Hill]
Breathe, breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe
