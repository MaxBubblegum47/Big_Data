[Verse 1]
Girl, we still got something here, I stay believing
Plus, I'm not going nowhere 'til I'm done breathing
Hell yeah, I made some mistakes
But there's no reason, we can't move on from this page

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, I got to cussing and I got to screaming and I got to losing my cool
I got to smoking and I got to drinking and taking my shit out on you
I got some habits, I thought I could have it; my cake, and be eating it, too
Damn, can't we move on from this pain

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't the same
Turn the car around, I'm not going back
Put out the flames
Hey, look at me now, I'm not going back
And, girl, I'm changed, changed
Yes, I'm changed, changed

[Verse 2]
See, I was hearing voices 24/7
Not saying they weren't my choices, baby, I made 'em
But if I knew what it meant, I would've changed 'em
Can we move on from this pain?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I got to cussing and I got to screaming and I got to losing my cool
I got to smoking and I got to drinking and taking my shit out on you
I got some habits, I thought I could have it; my cake, and be eating it, too
Damn, can't we move on from this pain

[Chorus]
Cause I ain't the same
Turn the car around, I'm not going back
Put out the flames
Hey, look at me now, I'm not going back
And, girl, I'm changed, changed
Yes, I'm changed, changed

[Bridge]
I know I crossed the line (but i swear)
If I had one more time (to fix it)
I know I'd change your mind, 'cause from today, I've changed

[Chorus]
Cause I ain't the same
Turn the car around, I'm not going back
Put out the flames
Hey, look at me now, I'm not going back
And, girl, I'm changed, changed
Yes, I'm changed, changed

[Outro]
Girl, believe I turned a leaf, I guarantee I've changed
Girl, tonight, I'm moving right, I've seen the light, I'm changed
