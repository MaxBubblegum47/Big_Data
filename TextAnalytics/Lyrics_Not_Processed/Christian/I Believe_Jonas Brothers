[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Every night, every day, how about every lifetime?
Yeah, I know what they say, and that's fine
'Cause I'm here to stay through the good and the bad times
Baby, save me a space in your mind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Well, call me crazy
And people saying that we move too fast
But I've been waiting, and for a reason
Ain’t no turning back

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause you show me something I can't live without
I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me, it's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
That you show me (Show me, show me)
That you show me (Show me, show me)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Everywhere that I go, feeling you all around me
Now that I got you close, I'm alright
Baby, I didn't know, but I'm glad that you found me
'Cause I'm seeing the most in your eyes, oh yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Call me crazy
People saying that we move too fast (Too fast)
But I've been waiting for a reason
Ain’t no turning back

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause you show me something I can't live without (Ah yeah, yeah)
And I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me (When you hold me)
It's like Heaven coming down (Mmm, yeah, yeah)
I believe, I believe, I believe

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
That you show me (Show me, show me), you show me
That you show me (Show me, show me), you show me

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Doesn't matter anymore, now I got you here with me
Nothing matters any longer, now I got you here with me
I think about you every time I, every time I lose myself again
I lose myself again

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause you show me something I can't live without
I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me, it's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe
'Cause you show me something I can't live without (Oh yeah)
And I believe, I believe, I believe
When you hold me (When you hold me)
It's like Heaven coming down
I believe, I believe, I believe

[Post-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
'Cause you show me (Show me, show me)
(Show me something I can't live without)
That you show me (Show me, show me), no, no
(And I believe, I believe, I believe)
(When you hold me, it's like) Heaven coming down
(Show me, show me)
'Cause you show me (Show me, show me)
I believe, I believe, I believe you

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Yeah
