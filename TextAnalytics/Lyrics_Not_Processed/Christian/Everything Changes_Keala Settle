[JENNA]
Today's a day like any other
But I'm changed, I am a mother
Oh, in an instant
And who I was has disappeared
It doesn't matter, now you're here
So innocent

I was lost
For you to find
And now I'm yours, and you are mine

Two tiny hands, a pair of eyes
An unsung melody is mine for safekeeping
And I will guard it with my life
I'd hang the moon for it to shine on her sleeping
Starting here and starting now
I can feel the heart of how

[JENNA, BECKY & DAWN]
Everything changes

[JENNA]
I didn't know, but now I see
Sometimes what is, is meant to be
You saved me
My blurry lines, my messy life
Come into focus and in time, maybe

I can heal and I can breathe
'Cause I can feel myself believe

[ALL]
Everything changes

[JENNA & ALL]
Oh my heart's at the wheel now

[JENNA]
And all my mistakes
They make sense when I turn them around
Everything changes
What I thought was so permanent fades
In the blink of an eye, there's a new life in front in my face
And I know in due time, every right thing will find its right place
So I swear I'll remember to say
We were both born today
'Cause everything changed
Everything changes
