[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, baby
I'm scatterbrained and lost in love
Ooh, I crave it on the daily
That sugar pill that dopes me up (Ahh)
Ooh, it's raining it's pourin'
I picture you in the mornin'
The hot water and the steam
Oh, the way that you feel between
Both my hands, on your hourglass
The minutes, then the hours pass
I wanna watch you bloom
Gimme that sweet perfume

[Pre-Chorus]
It's makin' my heart beat so fast
In my mind, you're the angel on the painted glass
Lookin' for high, divine, connection
I'm a lover, in need of confession

[Chorus]
Let me satisfy your soul
I'm not a saint, but do I have to be?
Well, baby, you're my holy ghost
And I need you close, come back to me

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I fantasize and I pray
I'm thirsty for your ecstasy
So open up your heavenly gates (Ahh)
Ooh, your tenderness is paradise
Baby, take me there and I will
Worship at your feet
You can have my soul to keep

[Pre-Chorus]
It's makin' my heart beat so fast
In my mind, you're the angel on the painted glass
Lookin' for high, divine, connection
I'm a lover, in need of confession

[Chorus]
Let me satisfy your soul
I'm not a saint, but do I have to be?
Well, baby, you're my holy ghost
And I need you close, come back to me

[Bridge]
(Ahh, ahh)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Ahh, ahh)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)

[Chorus]
Let me satisfy your soul
I'm not a saint, but do I have to be?
Well, baby, you're my holy ghost
And I need you close, come back to me, back to me
Let me satisfy your body and soul
No, I don't care if it's blasphemy
'Cause baby, you're my holy ghost
And I need you close, come back to me
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(You're the holy ghost)
(You're the holy ghost)
