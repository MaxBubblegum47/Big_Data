Wanna get out of the house and go dancin with us girl?
You know I wanna go dancin with my babes
Uh-uh, I'll text you the address girl

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
DJ, I'm 'bout to lose it
Play my boyfriend some music
Only got a few minutes
Til the night is over
DJ, I'm 'bout to lose it
Play my boyfriend some music
Only got a few minutes
Til the night is over
I just wanna dance and disappear with you
I just wanna dance and disappear with you
I just wanna dance and disappear with you

[Bridge: August Royals]
We can shake it all night long
Girl this is your favorite song
Let's just boogie til' we got nothing left all all
We can shake it all night long
Girl this is your favorite song
Let's just boogie til' we got nothing left all all

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
DJ, I'm 'bout lose it
Play my boyfriend some music
Only got a few minutes
Til the night is over
DJ, I'm 'bout lose it
Play my boyfriend some music
Only got a few minutes
Til the night is over
I just wanna dance and disappear with you
I just wanna dance and disappear with you
I just wanna dance and disappear with you
