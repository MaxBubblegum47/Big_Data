[Chorus: Big Sean]
(Yeah) I swear that I changed
I don't even rock the same chains
Me and them not in the same lane, nope
Swear that I've changed (yeah)
I even ran into my old hoe
And I told her I changed, yeah
And the number just changed
Man, I swear that I changed
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same (I know, I know)
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
As the winter turn to spring and the leaves start changing
Her dress get shorter and her weave start changing
Rocking short sleeves, my timepiece keep dangling and blinking
Ten diamond chains and they turnin' and tanglin'
Old Gucci Mane was addicted to dranking
New Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to Franklins
No, we not the same, I'm evolving
I'ma elevate long as the world keeps revolving
And I got problems, but they rich nigga problems
Used to see niggas like me and want to rob them
I know my granny prolly looking down at me now
They used to look down at me, but now look around
My house so big, my pool so muthafuckin deep
So plushed out, I don't really like to leave
My bitch so bad that I don't even go to sleep
Pussy so good, it make you wanna buy a ring

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I swear that I changed
I don't even rock the same chains
Me and them not in the same lanes, nope
Swear that I've changed (yeah)
I even ran into my old hoe
And I told her I changed, yeah
And the number just changed
Man, I swear that I changed
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same (I know, I know)
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Only thing that ever stayed the same was the name
You prolly wish I go back through the pain
Back when I was in school, contemplating if I ever even
Do music again, bitch, I'll do that shit again
Cause I never got lost when I follow my heart
I know I'm a walking target just dodging the darts
Used to focus on getting rich now I'm focused on getting smart (smart)
Cause that's the only thing that they can't take or tear apart (straight up)
Beast beast beast, bitch, watch out for my teeth (beast)
And I never miss a mil', both cash and feast (feast)
And my future set in stone like Medusa was me (whoah)
More focused in on this shit and tryna' get off that lease (don)
Cause if you wanna lease, they got yo' ass on a leash (damn)
And now I'm not a pet, I'm a vet, bitch please (bitch please)
The old me used to be a pushover, shit (yeah)
Then I pushed myself and a nigga took over (I took over)
One of the greats you bitches tend to look over (I am)
But bet I kill this shit every time that the hook over
It's over, yeah
Yeah bitch, it's over

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I swear that I changed
I don't even rock the same chains
Me and them not in the same lane, nope
Swear that I've changed (yeah)
I even ran into my old hoe
And I told her I changed, yeah
And the number just changed
Man, I swear that I changed
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same (I know, I know)
I know you prolly wish that I had stayed the same
