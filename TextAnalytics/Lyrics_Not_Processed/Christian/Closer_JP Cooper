[Chorus]
Don't you know I wish I was closer?
I'll be watching over
And if you're too small to see
I'll lift you on my shoulders
If you're feeling low, I'll hold ya'

[Verse 1]
I wanna be there in the morning
So, I'm working through the night
And I'll be smiling at you yawning
While you're rubbing those brown eyes
And if you ever need me, call me
I wanna make sure you're alright
I don't wanna be so far from home
You know you're daddy's little soldier
And your mother's handsome knight
Now, don't you worry about darkness
'Cause you're carrying the light
And those shadows fall when you're around

[Chorus]
Don't you know I wish I was closer?
I'll be watching over
And if you're too small to see
I'll lift you on my shoulders
If you're feeling low, I'll hold ya'

[Verse 2]
I want you close to me like songbirds want the trees
'Cause when you're close to me, my worries flee from me
'Cause when I'm with you, my feet don't touch the ground
Now, I'm not a king
But when I'm with you I feel like I'm wearing a crown
For you I sing, for you I sing, for you I sing

[Chorus]
Don't you know I wish I was closer?
I'll be watching over
And if you're too small to see
I'll lift you on my shoulders
If you're feeling low, I'll hold ya'
Oh, don't you know I wish I was closer?
I'll be watching over
And if you're too small to see
I'll lift you on my shoulders
If you're feeling low, I'll hold ya'

[Outro]
Don't you know I wish I was closer
I'll be watching over
