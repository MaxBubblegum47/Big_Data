If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my my my
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I'm glad


And so today, my world it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
But thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one, ah ah yeah
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I'm glad

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
Mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me
