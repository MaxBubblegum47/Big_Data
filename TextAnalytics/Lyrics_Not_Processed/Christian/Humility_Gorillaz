[Verse 1]
Calling the world from isolation
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
And if you're coming back to find me
You'd better have good aim

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoot it true, I need you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

[Chorus]
(Calling you) 
I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

[Verse 2]
Calling the hunter with the rifle
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoot it true, I want you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

[Chorus]
(Calling you) 
I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

[Bridge]
If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you down?

[Chorus]
I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
(If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?)
I don't want this isolation
(Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail)
See the state I'm in now?
(And let you down?)

[Outro]
If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you go?
