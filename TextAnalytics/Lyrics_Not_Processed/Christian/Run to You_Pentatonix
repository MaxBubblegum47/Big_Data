[Verse 1]
A light in the room
It was you who was standing there
Tried, it was true
As your glance met my stare
But your heart drifted off
Like the land split by sea
I tried to go, to follow
To kneel down at your feet

[Chorus]
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, run to you
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, run to you

[Verse 2]
I've been settling scores
I've been fighting so long
But I've lost your war
And our kingdom is gone
How shall I win back your heart
Which was mine?
I have broken bones
And tattered clothes
I've run out of time

[Chorus]
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, run to you
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, run to you

[Bridge]
Oh, I will break down the gates of heaven
A thousand angels stand waiting for me
Oh take my heart and I'll lay down my weapons
Break my shackles to set me free

[Chorus]
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, run to you
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run, run to you
