[Verse 1]
If it wasn't known, that our love will carry on
I will be the wind that echo's on the canyon wall
One more day with you, to walk around our neighbourhood
We will never know like it was understood

[Chorus]
We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light

[Verse 2]
If you've given up, I will call an end to this
I will be your rock from our perch
If you walk the ridge, you will find the marks, the scars
Kneel down by the tree, under the city stone

[Chorus]
We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light

We never say goodbye
I'll see you on this side
Or the other way
The desert sun kisses the sky
Baby hold the light
And keep it in your eyes
And promise that you dream with me
Beyond the walls of time
And when we laid aside
Just look up at the light

[Outro]
Just let me hold the light
Just let me hold the light
