You say, you’ve got a plan
And you’re planning on getting to it when you can
You’ve got, so much you wanna do
And when the time is right, the time right for you
You do it all someday, someday might be too late
So, don’t waste another minute, one more minute of your life
Looking up the rear-view mirror watching life go passing by
Don’t say you’re gonna wait, until the time is right
The only right time is right now
The right time is right now
The right time is right now
Don’t let your time run out
The right time is right now
The right time is right now
Your time, don’t let it slip through your hands
Grab that momеnt, cause you can’t get that moment back
Don’t go, go and throw it away
Bеtting on tomorrow, while you lose today
Don’t put it off to long, here and now will be here and gone
So, don’t waste another minute, one more minute of your life
Looking up the rear-view mirror watching life go passing by
Don’t say you’re gonna wait, until the time is right
The only right time is right now
The right time is right now
The right time is right now
Don’t let your time run out
The right time is right now
The right time is right now
Oh (4x)
The right time is right now
The right time is right now
Don’t let your time run out
The right time is right now
The right time is right now
