[Intro]
Baby, now please don't let me go
Look

[Verse 1]
I'm frozen, I rose from the ashes
I've woken the casket, I'm hopin' I open the passage
I wrote when I smoked it and passed it
I'm focused, no longer keep dope in the mattress, no
I'm overly passionate
On my own but I know that I asked for this
I've been told, bitch, I know I'm a masochist
If I ain't on the low, I'm with savages
Jump off, jump off, geronimo
I know you know the kinda hoes
That broke but she rock designer clothes
Take drugs like eeny miney moe

[Pre-Chorus]
Big league, big league
Money long, pullin' off 63's
16 on my own, hardcore
Gucci link make my chest freeze, I'm so cold

[Chorus]
You found me frozen, I'm so cold
Praying loud, save me got no gold
Baby now please don't let me go
(oh yeah)
And I got a lot of friends that turned to stone
Like you got inside of me
No, baby, now please don't let me go

[Verse 2]
Exotic cars, tops off like Mardi Gras
My weed louder than the cologne
Million cash in the floor board
I'm the warlord, uh
I took her to Bora Bora on my 4 doors
Bitches all in the corridor
Frozen heart match the Audemaur
Doin' yoga with a young Kammar, hold up
I'm all for it, throw it back
All fours, it ain't love, don't fall for it
It ain't love, don't fall for it

[Pre-Chorus]
Bitch, please just leave
Money long, pullin' off 63's
16 on my own, hardcore
Gucci link make my chest freeze, I'm so cold

[Chorus]
You found me frozen, I'm so cold
Praying loud, save me got no gold
Baby now please don't let me go
(oh yeah)
And I got a lot of friends that turned to stone
Like you got inside of me
No, baby, now please don't let me go
You found me frozen, I'm so cold
Praying loud, save me got no gold
Baby now please don't let me go
(oh yeah)
And I got a lot of friends that turned to stone
Like you got inside of me
No, baby, now please don't let me go
(oh yeah)
