[Verse 1]
Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober
Still, here we are, back in Hanover '99
Just like old times all over
Under the exit lights, as beautiful as ever
I really wish that I dressed up a little better
No regrets is what we said
We can't go back again

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

[Verse 2]
Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine; sometimes, it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

[Chorus]
Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

[Bridge]
Forever
Forever
Forever

[Chorus]
Nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, they'll never
Take those long summer days
When love was untamed
Two burning hearts are dared to break, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever
