[Verse 1]
Yeah, I think I got one
Her soul is presidential like Barack, son
Yeah, she call me Goose, I call her Maverick 'cause of Top Gun
They say we annoying, they just jealous 'cause we got love
(Aw, yeah)
Yeah, I got a hot one
She don't want no problem if there's not one
But people come around and try some stupid shit to start one
She'll give you the people's fuckin' elbow like The Rock, son
(Aw, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
There is a potion in your lips, so sweet, I'd die
There is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive
I hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
Yeah, I think I got one
And every single little thing about her is so—

[Chorus]
Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me

[Verse 2]
“Hey, do I impress you?”
I really like the way you rock a sweatsuit
When you working out
And I'm just watching how your legs move
They would think that you was, like, developed in a test tube
(Aw, yeah)
You deserve a theme song
You could be the shoulder that I lean on
Love it when you're late for work and try to slip your jeans on
You be bumping Chili Peppers all up in your Nissan
(Aw, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
There is a potion in your lips, so sweet, I'd die
There is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive
I hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
Yeah, I think I got one
And every single little thing about her is so—

[Chorus]
Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me

[Bridge]
You write checks that my ass can't cash
I bit a little more than I can chew
I bit a little more than I can chew
You write checks that my ass can't cash
I bit a little more than I can chew
I bit a little more than I can chew
'Cause everything about you is so—

[Chorus]
Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me
