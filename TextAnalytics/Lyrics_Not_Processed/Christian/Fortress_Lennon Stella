[Verse 1]
Why did you call it what you called it?
You could've called it off
Did you ever feel the way I did at all?
Probably gets you off
Thinking I'm broken
Shadows holding me with my fingers crossed
Like I'm in a corner, back against the wall
But I promise I'm not

[Pre-Chorus]
Up, up in the madness
You turned a lover to a savage
Think you're addicted to my sadness
No more

[Chorus]
You don't get in my brain
You don't fill up the spaces
I don't whisper your name
Now that I've built a fortress
I'll never be the same
So I'm cutting my losses
I'm not letting you in
Now that I've built a fortress
When you call, I ignore it
I built a fortress, mmm
Yeah, I built a fortress

[Verse 2]
Thought that you meant it
When you spent all those quiet nights on me
Told me all about the secrets that you keep
I thought you were so deep
So badly wanted something
So I let you keep taking me up, up in the madness, madness

[Chorus]
You don't get in my brain
You don't fill up the spaces
I don't whisper your name
Now that I've built a fortress
I'll never be the same
So I'm cutting my losses
I'm not letting you in
Now that I've built a fortress
When you call, I ignore it
I built a fortress, mmm
Yeah, I built a fortress

[Verse 3]
You said you did, but you don't give a fuck about us
You, all the words that you don't say speak the loudest
You said you did, but you don't give a fuck about us
'Bout us
Don't say it, don't say it

[Chorus]
You don't get in my brain
You don't fill up the spaces
I don't whisper your name
Now that I've built a fortress
I'll never be the same
So I'm cutting my losses
I'm not letting you in
Now that I've built a fortress
When you call, I ignore it
I built a fortress, mmm
Yeah, I built a fortress

[Outro]
When you call I ignore it
I built a fortress, mm no
Did you ever feel the way I did at all?
