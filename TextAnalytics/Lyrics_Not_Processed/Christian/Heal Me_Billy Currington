[Verse 1]
Use a lighter hand
I've got bruses you can't see
You can take your time
Your love is all I need
They say time is a healer
But it's been no friend to me
I've had a share of heartache
I've had my fill of pain
Girl you took away the hurt
And stopped the falling rain
I know you walk on water
I know that you can heal me

[Chorus]
Heal me
With your sweet and sexy ways
Feel me
Your touch is all I crave
I've been waiting for so long
For you to come along
And heal me

[Verse 2]
Girl don't cut yourself
On my broken heart
Watch for the jagged pieces
They might tear you apart
Oh, once you touch my soul
I know that you can heal me

[Chorus]
Heal me
With your sweet and sexy ways
Feel me
Your touch is all I crave
I've been waiting for so long
For you to come along
And heal me

[Verse 3]
Oh
Heal me
Stars are aligned
They're in perfect harmony
Love is the position
That you pour on me

[Chorus]
Heal me
With your sweet and sexy ways
Feel me
Your touch is all I crave
I've been waiting for so long
For you to come along
And heal me
