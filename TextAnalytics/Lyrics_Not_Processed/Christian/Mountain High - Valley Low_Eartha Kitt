If you need me I will be near by
Mountain high, valley low
My love follows you until the last
Lightening fast, turtle slow
Journey to the north star
South winds blow my thoughts to you
If you need me I will be near by
Mountain high, valley low
I'll be with you though I'll fortune sway
Lantern gay, willow sad
Spring will stroll out meadow everyday
Winter gray, summer glad
When your hair turns snow white
You will find me by your side
I'll be with you though I'll fortune sway
Lantern gay, willow sad
If you need me I will be nearby
Mountain high, valley low
My love follows you until the last
Lightening fast, turtle slow
Go in search of new moons
Dreams will bridge the skies to you
If you need me I will be nearby
Lantern gay, willow sad, valley low, MOUNTAIN HIIIIIIIGH!
