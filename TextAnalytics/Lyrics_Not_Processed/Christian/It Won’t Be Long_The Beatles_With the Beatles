[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

[Verse 1]
Every night when everybody has fun
Here am I sitting all on my own

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

[Bridge]
Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home

[Verse 2]
Every night the tears come down from my eyes
Every day I've done nothing but cry

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

[Bridge]
Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home

[Verse 3]
So every day we'll be happy I know
Now I know that you won't leave me no more

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you
