[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
In a time full of war, be peace
In a time full of doubt, just believe
Yeah, there ain't that much difference between you and me
In a time full of war, be peace

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
In a world full of hate, be a light
When you do somebody wrong, make it right
Don't hide in the dark, you were born to shine
In a world full of hate, be a light

[Post-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
La-la-la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 2: Keith Urban & 
Chris Tomlin
]
In a place that needs change, make a difference
In a time full of noise, just listen
'Cause life is but a breeze, better live it
In a place that needs a change, make a difference

[Chorus: Reba McEntire & 
Hillary Scott
]
In a world full of hate, be a light
When you do somebody wrong, make it right
Oh, don't hide in the dark, you were born to shine
In a world full of hate, be a light

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, la, la

In a race that you can't win, slow it down
Yeah, you only get one go around
'Cause the finish line is six feet in the ground
In a race you can't win, just slow it down

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett, Hillary Scott, Keith Urban, Reba McEntire, & Chris Tomlin]
In a world full of hate, be a light (Oh)
When you do somebody wrong, make it right (Make it right)
Don't hide in the dark (Don't hide in the dark), you were born to shine
In a world full of hate, be a light

[Outro: Thomas Rhett]
Yeah, it's hard to live in color
When you just see black and white
In a world full of hate, be a light
