Ooooooooooooo....killa [x2]

[Tony Tone]
If you're down to glide and slide on the Clair, then let's ride
Tony Tone roll with Bone on the dark side
But when you come just bring your guns witcha
If your a busta niggas gone have fun witcha
So nigga don't get me wrong, my niggas
Swang them thangs, bang some brains
Slangin' yayo, it all remains the same

[Wish Bone]
Step and you catchin some buck shots
Murder one on the Clair Nine Glock Glock
Mo Thug, whats up nigga get dropped
Put 'em in the mud, pop and I can't stop now
Niggas that I thug with kill
Pop to tha chest how does it feel
And nigga we peel caps
Pap, fin to get your wig cracked back
Killin' I'm buckin em down, I wish ya would
Try to get some, redrum, bitch
Nigga don't test my hood

[Tombstone]
A first degree murderin' wig splitta, grave digga
Diggin' a ditch, puttin' a bitch
And them snitches in the pit, so don't fuck with
Them niggas off the nine nine
The foundation of niggas commitin' a crime and murderin' every time
Nigga beware cuz here come the Clair
Mobbin' like them soldiers
Watch me fold ya
For actin' like somebody never told ya
So off we go, to the bloody row
Time to bless some souls, with that nine shot
Givin' props to the double Glock

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Pump pump when I let my shell down
Hit a lick now gimmee the goodies and nigga me dash
I reach for the gauge and mash
Yell out 187 and blast
Nigga don't test nuts your luck's fucked
You feelin' around for the bone yard
Thuggin' off with the graveyard shift
Then comin' to pull your whole card, bitch
Scandalous niggas, dwellin' the Clair be servin' them chop chop's
We rippin' them guts with buck shotz, pop pop

[Krayzie Bone]
You better be ready for this thug style
Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Flesh, Wish them wicked now
We straight off the Glock Glock
Well don't get your wig's split now
East 99 follow me down to me strip as we trip to the darkside
Betta grab your pop, niggas be
Trippin' and flippin' as soon they get out
187 you're caught in a murder
Niggas up to no good
Po po, fuck no
They never could fuck with a thug ho

[Chorus: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]
Pop pop givin up shotz to tha double Glock Glock [x4]

[Mo! Hart]
Nuthin but them killas, straight up thuggas
Rippin bucks of bloody clothes
Gaugin' pump eruptions nickel trip and shut and fuck 'em down
Buckin' them coppas down
Round after round after round
Bloody bodies badges spreaded out on the ground
Ain't no sound, just the demons screamin' rest in peace
I guess you got ta suffer
Feeling good dip hollow point tip, got your wig split
And made your body rupture
Hunt my victims on a mission
Flippin' livin' on a darker side
Creepin' on your homicide
Let my nuts and my gauge hang low now walk on by
Boogie Nikke's on a night ride

[Boogie Nikke]
Thuggin through my thuggish ass hood at night, with my pipe
Thuggin down the double Glock
Tryin' to get my serve on
Watchin' my back while six-five try to roll on
Put one to the suckas head and two up in his body
Now peep my creep I keep the reefer smoke all up inside me

[Layzie Bone]
We jumpin' up rough from the hood
We bailin' we thuggin' we lookin' like crooks
Could tell we be fatal, ready to roll
Know we willing and able
Rollin' with Ruthless bitch betta check my label
Murda dem, never come again
When the scandalous niggas set up
Bloody nigga trues be on my level
Eighty eight to ten five is the soldiers ghetto
Nigga don't take the wrong turn
You will enter the hood, wig splitters will cover your dome
At a cut where the thugs and hustlas roam
Cleveland Browns
Dogg Pound hoes, it's on

[Sin]
Let's begin in the mix, of a Clair player
You're liable to get your wigs split and dumped in a ditch bitch
Cause them thugs, sendin' them slugs
Leavin' em off in the cut in a puddle of blood say what
Don't make me go in my trench
Nigga ya got me bent
All fucked up,your luck's up, now gotta get sent
To your gravesite as John Doe for fuckin wit those...

[Gates]
It's them thugs runnin' amuck
On none but a slug all up in the territory
Never divide, go nationwide with the buck buck
So where you at, where you at?
I'm strapped and ready ta snap n yank a nigga's snapback
Split em Koolaid hats
In ta the graveyard
Pumped up betta get down
Step on tha Clair ta tear around
Chumps about to get struck
Ya still don't want some bitch but what the muthafuck I want
I want to wham you with a TEC-9
Now bitch press yo luck

[Chorus]
