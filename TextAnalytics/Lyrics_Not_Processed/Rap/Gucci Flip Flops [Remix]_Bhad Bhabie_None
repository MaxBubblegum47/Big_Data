[Intro]
30, you a fool for this one, Cheeze

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie & 
Plies
]
Gu-Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock
Pull the 6 out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to that pussy ass, turn the shit up a notch
Gucci flip flops (Fuck it), make it kick rocks (Bust it)
(
Aye, Bhad Bhabie
)
This a big clock, check the wristwatch (Check it)
(
Aye, Plies checkin' in
)
Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (Bust it)
(
This a Florida thing, they wouldn't understand
)
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock (Off the clock)
(
Aye, lemme tell it to 'em
)

[Verse 1: Plies]
If a nigga snatch your chain, then he ain't down with yo feature, bruh
If she let the whole gang hit, then she a eater, bruh
She yo lady, she ain't got a bag, then what you teaching her?
No, you ain't goin' up and let it rip then what you reaching for?
Bust it open, ain't like what I smell, this ain't no Captain D's
You a Whopper Jr., I'm a Whopper, I got extra cheese
Grass it got my eye-lids low, look like I'm Japanese
Wah, wah, wah, like Lil Baby, bitch, yes indeed
He never call about it, he just troll it again
Wanna see the snakes in your yard, you better mow it again
Aye, Christian Louboutin got my whole shoe bloody
Aye, went to H-town got my whole cup muddy
Aye, I got a bag I can't snooze, bitch, I got the tool on me
I'm from the south, I hit the gas, rrr, that is the doors on it
If ya' house nasty, I don't wanna poke, that's just the rule, mommy
Hit her in some Gucci flip flops, you can't lose, homie

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Gu-Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock
Pull the 6 out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to that pussy ass, turn the shit up a notch
Gucci flip flops (Fuck it), make it kick rocks (Bust it)
This a big clock, check the wristwatch (Check it)
Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (Bust it)
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock (Clock)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I only smoke when I drink, got silk, rock mink to the floor
And everything I get is on the ho
Got cars, got homes with pools and saunas
Lake with piranhas and some blue iguanas
Got cops on my tail, call Shamiqa and Darnell
Bad, bad, bad to the bone is what these bitches is
Text bad, 187 that's what the business is
Get away, smooth on the slide
Now I'm in the 305, I'm getting high, ride
So I hit up Plies, we the big macs
Munching on these small fries
Gangster shit, straight hip-hop
Fu-Fuckin' your bitch in Gucci flip flops
Big Snoop Dogg, I'm hard to deal with
Rest in peace triple X, that's on some real shit (What? What? What? What? What? What?)
Yeah, that's on some real shit (What? What? Yeah)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Gu-Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock
Pull the 6 out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to that pussy ass, turn the shit up a notch
Gucci flip flops (Fuck it), make it kick rocks (Bust it)
This a big clock, check the wristwatch (Check it)
Gucci flip flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (Bust it)
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock (Clock)
