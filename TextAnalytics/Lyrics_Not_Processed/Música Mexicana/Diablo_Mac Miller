[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rap diablo
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's the rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
Bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rappin' head honcho, rocking shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my g-pass? None of your fuckin' beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em
Tryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium
Fools I pity 'em, I'm not a human
I'm amphibian, fake superhero like the Mystery Men
I ain't saving nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels comin', skippin' all the famous functions
How do the famous function? The A-list can't be trusted
I strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society, I tell my bitch
If she don't love me then just lie to me, I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich, this is piracy (Piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fucking eyes to see
Come and die with me

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Yeah, said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies

[Verse 2]
Yeah, um
Okay, my mind is Yoda, I'm on Ayatollah
These other rappers just a diet soda
I find Jehovah in the darkest places, empty as apartment basements
This a marathon gentlemen, go 'head and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
You'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin', now you on vacation
Rappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas
Lava makin', so hot I'm turning hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations
Contemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle, I'm the show, you the commercial
I been poppin' like a kernel, readin' Justin Bieber's journal
Treat you like a urinal

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Yeah, said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
