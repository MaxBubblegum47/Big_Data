[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, I'm wide awake, I’m wide awake
I'm wide awake
Hey, I'm wide awake, I’m wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain’t no stress on me Lord, I’m movin' forward
Keep movin’ forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I’m movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Hmm, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Hey, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done "specially invited guest"'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
Peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me)
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy than to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
Oh, things ain't like before
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed and-

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
(Movin' forward, movin' forward, movin' forward)
Movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Something was wrong (Keep movin' forward)
Couldn't hold on, why? (Keep movin' forward)
So long (Keep movin' forward)
Sit here in this storm (Keep movin' forward)
Time goes on (Keep movin' forward)
Really couldn't find my way out (Keep movin' forward)
Of the storm (Keep movin' forward)
Which way do I go?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so—I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
