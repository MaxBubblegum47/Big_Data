[Verse 1]
The moon outside
Too bright
Those blinds, yeah, let's just keep 'em closed, you know
My hands, they know where to go
To find your finger tips
Trace 'em back to your lips
Take you on a trip
Flip that switch

[Chorus]
Make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black

[Verse 2]
Like your dress on the floor
Yeah the one you don't need anymore
Black like a sky with no stars
Just find me and fall into my arms

[Chorus]
And make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black

[Bridge]
I don't wanna see a thing
Baby I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush
I don't wanna see a thing
I just wanna feel your love

[Chorus]
Make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black

[Outro]
Make my world go black, black
I don't wanna see a thing
(Black, black)
I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush
(Black, black)
(Black, black)
