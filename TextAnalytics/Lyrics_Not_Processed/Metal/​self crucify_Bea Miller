[Verse 1]
You can call me what you wanna
'Cause I've probably called me worse
And I hit the rocky bottom
In my fourteenth year on Earth

[Pre-Chorus]
What's the point of, what's the point of
Pretendin' we're alright?
It's important, it's important
To not self-crucify

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Leavin' what I've outgrown
Oh, oh, oh, so
You can find me alone
I start each party sayin' that I have to go
Oh, oh, oh, so
You can find me, you can find me alone

[Verse 2]
I had to leave one of my mamas
'Cause of my money that she stole
And if you can't trust your mother
I guess you're better on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
But I forgive her, I forgive her
So I can sleep at night
'Cause I remember, I remember
To not self-crucify

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Leavin' what I've outgrown
Oh, oh, oh, so
You can find me alone
I start each party sayin' that I have to go
Oh, oh, oh, so
You can find me, you can find me alone

[Interlude]
Hello?
Hello?
Hey!
Hey!

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Leavin' what I've outgrown
Oh, oh, oh, so
You can find me alone
I start each party sayin' that I have to go
Oh, oh, oh, so
You can find me alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Leavin' what I've outgrown
Oh, oh, oh, so
You can find me alone
I start each party sayin' that I have to go
Oh, oh, oh, so
You can find me alone

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Leavin' what I've outgrown
Oh, oh, oh, so
You can find me, you can find me alone
