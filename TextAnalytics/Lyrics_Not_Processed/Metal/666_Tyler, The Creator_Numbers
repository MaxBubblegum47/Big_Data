[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I push the 8 ball right across the pool table
Not basketball but im saying my game could fool April
Its such a marvelous day and niggas still will hate you
Plant a tree water the surroundings than wait to peel a grapefruit
Success is my escape route drive it like a grey coupe
License invalid, I'm headed to my palace
I'm a cowboy bitch I'm rowdy, music playing loudly
I'm fresh in my attire you boys just in the choir
I'm rolling sober take your king out of cobra
No venom in 'em, open my hand of women
I'm about 
the benjaminem
, fucking off as I spend it
In foreign countries comfy and fucking distant
Gold bitches wash my dick and clean the kitchen
Tatted with golf wang cats
 and stencils scripted where they dippin
If it ain't about a waffle then we dippin
Bitch im too wide expedition pay attention before you miss it nigga listen

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I got your back like a spinal tap
Yoga mats runnin out of bubbles soda flat
Nigga hulk attack green snaps from dojer raps
My wolves lurk where logan at
Wolf gang musical chairs I fuckin fold you back
Rollin up weed and im dabbin the wax
You stick to the script ho I get to the facts
Rippin through tracks like a train conducter
I'm giving them tasks, I'm the instructor
Roofs on fire like DJ Khaled tour bus
Smokin on weed bitch I'm high as a kite
Breakin down more finna hop on this flight
Born a real nigga real nigga for life
Don't believe in the hype baby this 
mellowhype
Smoke good for the night so I'm good for the night
I'm taking it back to the house going to the hood for the night
Bats on heels nigga straps gon' kill
The cab no wheels jack told Jill
I don't like kinds and icons who pipe dimes and so on
Let by gones be by gones and tai quan do on

[Verse 3: Mike G]
Where I stand still fucking awesome I am
Need chains with more rocks then rocks and sand in iran
I saute the chef and if its Odd you want to test
It will be one big room full of triple 6 reppers
Always say that I'm lo key with my moves
Cause I'm a ninja I don't like niggas to see what I do
And my focus was on saving grace
Till I got that late call that wolf killed ace
Heard he sprayed up the place
Well I'm the Midnight Marauder that makes twilight music
And fans think that I'm more awkward then Kristen Stewart
Couldn't do it without the losers that thought I wouldn't do it
No sympathy for the ones that never stuck to it
Attack em, rack em, wrap em in the back of a Buick
Wonder how my day goes it ain't nothing but music
And wonder how I spend my evenings and my kind of night would be
See my kind of night would be nylon rope duct tape
Me and Ameriie
