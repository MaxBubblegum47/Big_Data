[Verse 1]
Dog day, Tuesday
Hope that girl she come today
Hard life, it's a city life
Sweat keep pourin' down
I've got my feet up, like to love
Through the dawn, till I've blown
All I want's her lovin'-down
Love the way she move around

[Pre-Chorus]
Need no excuse
To let it all hang loose
My body's for abuse

[Chorus]
Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power
You've got it

[Verse 2]
Love life, up all night
Darkest hour at the dead of night
Seen her walkin' down the street
The kind of woman that brings on heat
Love hard, dusk till dawn
Come the morning, she was gone
Took me out, to my surprise
Money blown, left high and dry

[Pre-Chorus]
Need no excuse
To let it all hang loose
My body's for abuse

[Chorus]
Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power
Gonna end up torn to shreds

[Solo]
(That's the power!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't need no excuse
My body's for abuse

[Chorus]
Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power
Gonna end up torn to shreds

[Outro]
Rise!
Rise!
I'm gonna rise!
Rising power
The power rise
From you
