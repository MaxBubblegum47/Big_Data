Who am I to say things may not all be what they seem?
And how can I disturb the facts of life?
And who am I to speak about the fabric of a dream?
And who's to say that dreams cannot be right?
It's the power of the moon
The power
Who am I to talk about the lunacy at hand?
Burnishing the madness in my head
And who am I to mention that before it all began
Everything I heard was never said at all?
It's the power of the moon
The power
Ah, it's a green balloon that travels so benign
On a path that goes along the shoreline
Ah, it's a green balloon that travels so benign
It's the only thing that's keeping me in line
Oh, the tides will rise and then they fall on time
And everything on earth begins to rhyme
