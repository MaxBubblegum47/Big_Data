[Verse 1]
My little Mexican woman
Got herself a hot little body. (whistle)
That little sweet senorita
Knows how to be the life of the party
We dance and we talk
Hold hands when we walk
Shoot tequilla all night long
She can't understand
Why this rambling man
Says its time to be moving on
My little sweet Georgia peach
She sure knows how to show me a good time
She's got the longest legs
I swear they're smoother than her daddy's moonshine. (that's smooth)
We eat her mama's fried chicken
Go skinny dipping
Drink cold beer all night long
She can't understand
When this rambling man
Says its time to be moving on

[Chorus]
I got places to be
I got people to see
Got both ends of the candle to burn
But I'll try to hurry
So girls don't you worry
I promise you shall return

[Verse 2]
My little Miami friend
With that cinnamon skin, lord shes so fine. (sure is)
She always lights up my night
With a ray of pure Florida sunshine
Man we work on our tans
Roll around in the sand
Chug Bacardi all night long
She don't understand
When this rambling man
Says its time to be moving on

[Chorus]
I got places to be
I got people to see
Got both ends of the candle to burn
But I'll try to hurry
So girls don't you worry
I promise you shall return

I got places to be
I got people to see
Got both ends of the candle to burn
But I'll try to hurry
So girls don't you worry
I promise you shall return

[Outro]
No, don't worry girls, I shall return
