Where you from nigga?

[Layzie Bone]
Straight from the muthafuckin' land ah the heartless
Five true thugs from the double Glock
Ready ta pop to the dome, eternally it's on

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
Staright Mo Thug nigga return from the Claire
Test this hustla betta not dare
We thug on the block distribute our yayo
Little Layzie be there
Daily collectin' me bank roll
Rollin' wid Trues, nothing to lose
Never the less ain't about that talking
Screamin' out murda coming ta serve ya
Nigga we told ya Bone be stalking, (sleep walking)
Number one assassin
Pick up the pump and it causing the 12-guage eruption
Let loose wid ah buckshot blastin'
Bone up outta the cut and we buckin'
Eternally here to stay in the khaki suits and the high tec boots
Oops I'm comin' wid troops, fools
Be ready ta shoot collectin' my loot
Blazin' and burnin' my grain
Nasty insane, I crept and I came
Niggas that fell off that thought they could hang
Givin' up slang, tryna' fuck wid ah chain gang, bang!
Str8 land ah the heartless
Where the thugs be thinkin' on execution
Straight prosecution little Lay go buck and start confusion

Chill wit' me roll-roll-roll to the Bone yard hit that hydro

Well I really keep that high on, my mind fried

Follow me now, and ride, follow me come inside
You can run but won't escape alive
So many tried but died

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Niggas be runnin' and duckin' them bullets
They try to escape me but only get sprayed
Gotta get away when the po-po's chase me
So me, runnin' wid-a-me gauge
Bang bang, put em' in a coffin

Smoke bud all day and maintain
They come, they gun, they run
From the po-po jump the fence
