[Verse 1]
Coming out of nowhere
Driving like rain
Stormbringer dance
On the thunder again
Dark cloud gathering
Breaking the day
No point running
Because it's coming your way

[Chorus]
Ride the rainbow
Crack the sky
Stormbringer coming
Time to die
Got to keep running
Stormbringer coming
He's got nothing you need
He's going to make you bleed
And you know he's gonna get you

[Verse 2]
Rainbow shaker
On a stallion twister
Bareback rider
On the eye of the sky
Stormbringer coming down
Meaning to stay
Thunder and lightning
Heading your way

[Chorus]
Ride the rainbow
Crack the sky
Stormbringer coming
Time to die
Got to keep running
Stormbringer coming
He's got nothing you need
He's going to make you bleed

[Verse 3]
Coming out of nowhere
Driving like rain
Stormbringer dance
On the thunder again
Dark cloud gathering
Breaking the day
No point running
Because it's coming your way

[Outro]
'Cause it's coming your way
'Cause it's coming your way
'Cause it's coming your way
'Cause it's coming your way
'Cause it's coming your way
