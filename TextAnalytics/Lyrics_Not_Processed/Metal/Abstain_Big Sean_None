[Intro]
Abstain
You got to abstain

"Civility is not a sign of weakness."

[Hook]
I'm just trying to let y'all see the way
Abstain and y'all will see some better days
Don't mess with drugs or try to creep
Unless y'all want to end up six feet deep

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Big Sean 'bout to claim the game
When it comes to sex and drugs I stay abstain
I saw all my momma did for an easier world
I'mma mess it all up for a sleazier girl
Don't listen to these fast girls bringing drama
Cause they don't even want to be a baby momma
Listen, let me tell y'all 'bout Percy
Hustling on the corner selling coke and Hershey
Geared up too, straight down to his shoes
He had an E-class Benz on top of 22's
In his own head he thought he was lethal
Until he bumped heads with the wrong people
Now Percy was pissed, a push and a shuffle
A couple cats try to knock P for his hustle
To make a long story short, the gang got to his head
He heard a boom, he was dead
Shot, found under a bridge
Worst thing is he had a baby girl and a kid
Man, now how that sound to you?
Had a wife and a kid then his life was through
Caught up trying to make some money
For real, sex and drugs ain't even funny

[Hook] x 2

[Verse 2 - Part 1: Yungboyz (?)]
I'm a dozen years old, keep my ... froze
Abstain the game, I fall to thugs ...
Avoid the drugs, stop girls from pregnancy, stop boys from sex
All I know's the whole world's correct
All the pollution, stop the confusion
People killing each other for no reason, everyday of the season
Who's looking at the face of the Earth? - Uh
Who's looking at you smoking a blunt? - Uh
Who's looking at you doing bad things? - Uh
Who's looking at you flashing a ...

[Verse 2 - Part 2: Yungboyz (?)]
I run this beat like my name was Jay-Hova
Don't do drugs it will blow your mind over
Don't follow people when the streets dealing weed, it rude
Because your peeps looking straight at you

[Hook] x 3

[Outro]
R-J-98, it's great
"Civility is not a sign of weakness."
"Whatever hater."
