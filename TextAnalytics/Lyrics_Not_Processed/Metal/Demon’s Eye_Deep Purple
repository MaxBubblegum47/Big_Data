I don't mind just what you say
I never heard you, baby, never heard you anyway
I don't care what you do
Just so long as it ain't me and you
Sly, sly, like a demon's eye
Everything's good, I said, "Everything's fine"
You don't know, don't know it's the end of your time
How does it feel to be turned away?
I've known it, baby, almost every day
Sly, sly, like a demon's eye
I don't need you anymore
I don't want you, baby, hanging round my door
You slip and slide round my brain
You think you're so clever, yeah, but you know you're insane
Sly, sly, like a demon's eye
I d-d-don't mind just what you say
I never heard you, baby, I never heard you anyway, no I didn't
Everything's good, everything's fine
You don't know it's the end of your time
Sly, sly, like the demon's eye, like the demon's eye
Oh oh yeah, you're so sly baby yeah ooh yeah
You make me feel upside down, oh
