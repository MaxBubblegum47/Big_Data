[Intro: Nelly Furtado]
Go Timbo!

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
I'll be the same when it all goes up
I'll be the same when it all goes down
Not the first one, open it up
I'll be the last one closin' it out
Don't know if I'll give you a shot yet
Lil' momma, I'm peepin your style
Do I think you're dope enough? Yup!
One way of findin' it out
The way you came at me, boo
Don't care, not afraid I'm like wild
Really want it all head to toe
Question - is she gon' let it out?
Anyway the hour glass go
I don't worry anyhow
Why don't we see where it go?
Let's figure it out
(Break it down)

[Chorus: Timbaland & (Nelly Furtado)]
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after)
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after dark)

[Verse 2: SoShy]
I got a little secret for ya
I never sleep when it comes the night
But every time I snap my fingers
I switch back into the light
My moon belongs to your sun
Your fire is burning my mind
Is it love or is it lust?
Something that I just can't describe (Ah)
Am I the one and only? (Ah)
Cause you're the only one (Ah)
It felt so long and lonely (Ah)
Waiting for you to come
It's looking bright and early
I'm willing to close my eyes
This is the unusual story
Timbo and SoShy

[Chorus: Timbaland & (Nelly Furtado)]
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after)
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after dark)

[Verse 3: Nelly Furtado]
I need some R.E.M., but
I don't like sleepin' alone
So come and pick me up as
Soon as you put down the phone
I wanna get into trouble
Later you'll carry me home
I wanna go undercover
I just wanna rattle your bones
Yes, I'm the one and only
But I'm not the only one
So let's work overtime
On this shift, stay up with the sun
Maybe we can start a riot
Maybe we can burn this town
Maybe Iâ€™ll be your vampire
We can figure it out!

[Chorus: Timbaland & (Nelly Furtado)]
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after)
When the cats come out, the bats come out to play, yeah
(In the morning after)
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
(In the morning after dark)

[Outro: Timbaland & (Nelly Furtado)]
Dark dark dark dark dark
(In the morning after dark)
Dark dark dark dark dark
(In the morning after dark)
Please don't leave me, girl
(In the morning after dark)
Please don't leave me, girl
(In the morning after dark)
When the cats come out the bats come out to play
When the cats come out the bats come out to play
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way
When the cats come out the bats come out to play
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way
