[Verse 1]
Don't matter what people say
I never did believe them
I know, I know they know everything
I’ll be alright by myself
And no one's gonna tell me I'm defined
Confined by love
Now our days seem strange
I guess my heart was bound to change

[Chorus]
I fell out, out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you're falling into history
I fell out, out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you're falling into history

[Verse 2]
I never thought that I'd say
That I don't really miss you
I lived, I breathed your breath through me
Time has a way of passing by
Until I don't remember why or how to hurt for you
Love's pain has gone somewhere
And I'm finally hanging it there

[Chorus]
I fell out, out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you're falling into history
I fell out, out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you're falling into history

[Bridge]
Falling into, falling into, you're falling into history, yeah
Falling into, falling into, you're falling into history

[Chorus]
I fell out, out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you’re falling into history
I fell out, out of you and me
You're fading from view
And you're falling into history

[Outro]
I'll be alright by myself
And no one's gonna tell me I'm defined
Confined by love
