[Verse 1]
A silver gun in which I'm facin’
You've got this wrong, you are mistaken
Inject me with some kind of poison
Body shuts down and I'm left fallin’
Am I supposed to fight
And leave my soul behind?
Blank walls surrounding me
Stuck in between two scenes
And every part of me
Was left purple and green
One more lost lonely teen
Left broke down chasing dreams

[Bridge]
Now what am I to do?
In this state of feeling confused
Planning out my revenge on you

[Pre-Chorus]
In this afterlife
I see you as the killer
Pulling down on the trigger
Think I mean nothing to ya
In this afterlife
I will prove that you're ugly
Yeah, make your new boyfriend love me
'Til there's no one above me

[Chorus]
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife

[Verse 2]
I heard a man will be waitin'
To kill me right where I began
Then I will die for the third time
Then rise up limpin' like a zombie
Am I supposed to fight
And leave my soul behind?
Blank walls surrounding me
Stuck in between two scenes
And every part of me
Was left purple and green
One more lost lonely teen
Left broke down chasing dreams

[Bridge]
Now what am I to do? (Oh, what I am to do?)
In this state of feeling confused (Confused, confused)
Planning out my revenge on you (On you)

[Pre-Chorus]
In this afterlife
I see you as the killer
Pulling down on the trigger
Think I mean nothing to ya
In this afterlife
I will prove that you're ugly
Yeah, make your new boyfriend love me
'Til there’s no one above me

[Chorus]
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife

[Outro]
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife
In the afterlife, afterlife, afterlife
