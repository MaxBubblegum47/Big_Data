[Intro]
He loves to drive 'em crazy
With his evil lips
Great guns are blazin'
What a deadly trip

[Verse]
Yeah, born of no family, born of no creed
Yeah, raised by a jackal, raised a bad seed
You better look around before you hit the ground
Give me no quarrel, lives of crime

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a devil on a deadline
Gonna send you down

[Chorus]
Demon fire, is all you desire
Demon fire, it glows sapphire

[Verse 2]
Seeking all power, girl I'll hunt you down
Goin' out on a flash, gonna knock you out
You better look around
Hear the evil sound
Give me no quarrel, drenched in grime
*Heave*

[Pre-Chorus]
With all the bad intentions
Gonna send you down

[Chorus]
Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire, it glows in its fire
Demon fire, flames burn higher
Demon fire, it's an all-out hellfire

[Solo]
Hey!

[Chorus]
Demon fire, is all you desire
Demon fire, it glows in its fire
Demon fire, flames burn higher
Demon fire, it's an all-out hellfire
Fire, demon, fire
Fire, demon, fire
Demon fire
