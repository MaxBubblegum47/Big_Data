[Verse 1]
Bring on your forces of nature
Bring on the storm that's raging
And if you get lost in the shadows
There's a fire inside you
Be the light that guides you

[Chorus]
Come on, carry your flame
Carry it higher
Leave it in the darkness
Carry your torches
Come on, carry your flame
Set the night on fire
Leave it in the darkness
Carry your torches

[Verse 2]
Bring on your bows and arrows
Bring on your plagues and pharaohs
Cause if you get lost in the shadows
There's a fire inside you
And you know that I'll find you

[Chorus]
Come on, carry your flame
Carry it higher
Leave it in the darkness
Carry your torches
Come on, carry your flame
Set the night on fire
Leave it in the darkness
Carry your torches

[Refrain]
Torches
Torches
Torches
Torches
Ooh

[Chorus]
Come on, carry your flame
Carry it higher
Leave it in the darkness
Carry your torches
Come on, carry your flame (torches)
Set the night on fire (torches)
Leave it in the darkness (torches)
Carry your torches (torches)

[Outro]
Carry your torches (torches)
(Torches)
Carry your torches (torches)
Torches, ooh
Torches
Torches
Torches, torches, ooh
