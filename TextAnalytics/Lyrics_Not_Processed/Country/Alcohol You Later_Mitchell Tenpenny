[Verse 1]
Number one on my speed dial
I changed her name so my friends won't find out
But they're all headin' home now
And I got word that she's hangin' downtown
I know I shouldn't do it
Oh, but these shots I'm shootin' make me not give a damn

[Chorus]
And now it's one more last time, we swore we wouldn't
But it's one more sunrise breaking through these curtains
And I know when we're sober, we'll both say, "It's over"
But it ain't really over
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later

[Verse 2]
Two-for-Ones on a Tuesday
Bartender poured 'em too strong 'cause he knows me
Then I take out my phone, find out if she's at home
'Cause I need someone to drink with

[Chorus]
And now it's one more last time, we swore we wouldn't
But it's one more sunrise breaking through these curtains
And I know when we're sober, we'll both say, "It's over"
But it ain't really over
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later

[Bridge]
I know I shouldn't do it
Oh, but these shots I'm shootin' make me not give a damn

[Chorus]
And now it's one more last time, we swore we wouldn't
But it's one more sunrise breaking through these curtains
And I know when we're sober, we'll both say, "It's over"
But it ain't really over
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
'Cause alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol you later
