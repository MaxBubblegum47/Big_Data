[Verse]
Is it all right if I come round?
Is it too late if I come now?
Would you stay up to figure this out
Some way?
An' if I stay here, would you come back?
If I stay cool, would you be mad?
Would you want me if I want you
That way?

[Chorus]
'Cause all I can think about is
Coming over, coming over
All I can think about is
Comin' over, comin' over
All I can think about is
Comin' over, comin' o-, comin' over...

[Verse]
Well isn't it strange that every time
I look at your name I'm suddenly high?
For you to feel the same I would do almost anything
I'd give away this, give away that
All o' my shoes an' all o' my hats
All I need's you an' a bit of music now

[Chorus]
'Cause all I can think about is
Coming over, coming over
All I can think about is
Comin' over, comin' over
All I can think about is
Comin' over, comin' o-, comin' over...

[Bridge]
We can take it slow
Just like somebody you know
If you trust your body and soul
What a night this could be
Ah we can take it slow
I wanna be that body you know
Give me your body and soul
What a night this could be, ooh-whoa

[Chorus/Outro]
'Cause all I can think about is
Coming over, coming over
Oh-oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh oh-oh oh
All I can think about is
Oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Comin' over, comin' over
Oh-oh, oh oh-oh oh
All I can think about is
Oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Comin' over, comin' o-, comin' over...
Oh-oh, oh oh-oh oh
(Oh-oh, oh oh-oh)
Ooh-whoa...
(Oh-oh, oh-oh oh)
(Oh-oh, oh oh-oh oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh oh)
(Oh-oh, oh oh-oh oh)
