I remember the good days
The 'everything as it should' days
The 'love as much as we could' days
Yeah, I remember the good days
It didn't matter if it rained
It didn't matter 'bout my pain
With you around, I was okay
And everyday was a good day
Yeah, everyday was a good day
My hand, and your hand, we kept running
Somehow, with you, it was always sunny
Living as if we would live forever, uh
We didn't care that we had no money
We didn't think that the old is nothing
We had it all 'cause we had each other, uh
Give me back the touch
That I miss too much
Make it real again
When did we become
Just like everyone
We said we would never be like?
I remember the good days
The 'everything as it should' days
The 'love as much as we could' days
Yeah, I remember the good days
It didn't matter if it rained
It didn't matter 'bout my pain
With you around, I was okay
And everyday was a good day
My hand, and your hand keeps on slipping
Somehow, with you, it's just not clicking
Why can't we love, baby, love forever? Uh
The more we possess, the more we're stressin'
More we forget, the more we're missin'
Out on the things we should be living for
When did we become
Just like everyone
We said we would never be like?
I remember the good days
