[Verse 1]
When you got off work at five
I'd be the first thing on your mind
Every time
And if I wasn't where you thought I'd be
You'd drive around 'til you found me
If it took all night
You'd press me to your lips
Say you never felt like this
And I'd be all you'd need
And you'd get drunk on me

[Chorus]
Maybe if I was a neon light
I'd lead your car right back to my door
Oh, maybe if I was a jukebox needle dropping on a drinking song
You'd want one more
If my name was Whiskey
Maybe right now you'd miss me

[Verse 2]
You might try a different fix
A stronger shot
A harder mix
But they wouldn't get you baby
And if everyone you know
Said you ought to let me go
You'd tell 'em they were crazy, so crazy

[Chorus]
Maybe if I was a neon light
I'd lead your car right back to my door
Oh, maybe if I was a jukebox needle dropping on a drinking song
You'd want one more
If my name was Whiskey
Maybe right now you'd miss me...

[Bridge]
Maybe if I was your last call
My heart wouldn't be like glass all over the floor
Oh, maybe if I was a jukebox needle dropping on a drinking song
Then you'd want one more

[Chorus]
If my name was Whiskey
Maybe right now you'd miss me
You never would've quit me
If my name was Whiskey
