[Verse 1: ORKID, 
Gustaf Norén & ORKID
]
I've come undone
Can only fake it for so long
Kept it at bay
It's been too high a price to pay, baby
Blown out of line
My screwed up heart has knocked me blind
Breaking the code
To get me pass this time of low, low, low

[Pre-Chorus: Gustaf Norén & ORKID]
Somebody told me that somebody wanted somebody like me
And I hope that somebody is you
I am nobody, but I wish I could be somebody with you
If someone like you came along

[Chorus: Gustaf Norén & 
ORKID
]
Like somebody like me
Like somebody like me
Like somebody like me

[Verse 2: Gustaf Norén, 
Gustaf Norén & ORKID
]
Forever more
You give me peace at time of flaw
A sea less shore
You lift the turtles from the sky, sky, sky
And I don't know exactly what I'm asking for
So lead the way and got me where you wanna go
You have control
I will follow if you take me home

[Pre-Chorus: Gustaf Norén & ORKID]
Somebody told me that somebody wanted somebody like me
And I hope that somebody is you
I am nobody, but I wish I could be somebody with you
If someone like you came along

[Chorus: Gustaf Norén, 
ORKID
, 
Gustaf Norén & ORKID
]
Like somebody like me
Like somebody like me
Like somebody like me

[Bridge: Gustaf Norén & ORKID, 
Gustaf Norén
]
When I was young
My mama left me all alone
But now I see the sun
My heart is beating rapidly
As I look deep into your eyes

[Chorus: Gustaf Norén, 
ORKID
, 
Gustaf Norén & ORKID
]
Like somebody like me
Like somebody like me
Like somebody like me
Like somebody like me
Like somebody like me
Like somebody like me
