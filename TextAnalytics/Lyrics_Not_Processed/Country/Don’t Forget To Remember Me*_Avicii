[Verse]
Don't you forget to remember
Me when nothing's going right
I will be there when you need me
Call me any day, any night, hey
Lean on me when you get weary
Lean on me when you get hurt
Don't you worry about nothin'
I will wipe the dirt from your shirt

[Chorus]
'Cause when the whole thing feels like darkness
When it all turns out so bleak
When there's no on left to turn to
Don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me
