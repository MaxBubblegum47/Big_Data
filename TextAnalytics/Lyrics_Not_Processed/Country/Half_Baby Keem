[Hook: Baby Keem]
Just went half on a bitch, bitch wanna see how much I spent
All eyes on my clip like this, wish yo' ass could get like this, woah
Off-White be my fit
Made enough cash, gotta bend ten fat
Lil' bitch broke my heart last year
God on the phone, I'll get her like that
Just went half on a bitch, bitch wanna see how much I spent
All eyes on my clip like this, wish yo' ass could get like this, woah
Off-White be my fit
Made enough cash, gotta bend ten fat
Lil' bitch broke my heart last year
God on the phone, I'll get her like that

[Verse: Baby Keem]
Just got word of the throne
Back up, ho, back, back, back off me
Humbled another bad bitch, I'm sorry
Y'all better know the status, I'm sorry
Dodging another addict, models in the attic
Gettin' antic, my lifestyle jagged
High fashion, I don't talk much, quiet assassin
It take a lot to get like this, why your man can't get like this?

[?] all up in my fit

[?] on my whip
See you then I swerve
Bitch, I go to work
See you then I swerve
Bitch, I go to work

God on the phone, I'll get her like that
Just went half on a bitch, bitch wanna see how much I spent
