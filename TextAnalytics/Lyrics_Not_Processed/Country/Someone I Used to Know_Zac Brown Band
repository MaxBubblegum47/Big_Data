[Verse 1]
Hometown hero at the bar
Burned out high life super star
You know
Kept a buzz to fill the hole
Loved the lights and stole the show

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

[Chorus]
It’s been a long time comin’
Couldn’t keep on runnin’
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin’
With the path you’re choosin’
And it’s time to let go
Of someone that I used to know

[Post-Chorus]
Know, know
Know, know
Someone that I used to know

[Verse 2]
Rides the high that tears him down
Hates himself and loves the crowd
The king of fools, a heavy crown
He didn’t know he almost drowned

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

[Chorus]
It’s been a long time comin’
Couldn’t keep on runnin’
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin’
With the path you’re choosin’
And it’s time to let go
Of someone that I used to know

[Post-Chorus]
Know, know
Know, know

[Chorus]
It’s been a long time comin’
Couldn’t keep on runnin’
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin’
With the path you’re choosin’
And it’s time to let go
Of someone that I used to
Someone that I used to know
Know
Know, ooh

[Outro]
Know, know
Know, know
Know
