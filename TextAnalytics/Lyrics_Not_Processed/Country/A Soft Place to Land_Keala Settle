Sugar
Sugar, butter, flour

Sometimes I still see her
My mother, the dreamer
She'd say, “Nothing's impossible, child”

[JENNA, BECKY & DAWN]
A dream needs believing
To taste like the real thing
Like some stranger you recognize

[BECKY & DAWN, JENNA]
So pure
So pure, so electric  So electric
So sure
So sure, so connected  So connected

[JENNA, BECKY & DAWN]
To those little believers inside
May we all be so lucky

But dreams are elusive
The kind we've gotten used to is

[JENNA, DAWN, BECKY]
Nothing I can feel
Nothing I can hold
Nothing I can have
Nothing that I know

[JENNA, BECKY & DAWN]
Dreams come and they go

[JENNA, BECKY & DAWN]
But hold them and keep them
But hold them and keep them
And know that you need them
And know that you need them

[JENNA]
When your breaking point's all that

[JENNA, BECKY & DAWN]
You have

A dream is a soft place to land
May we all be so lucky
