Yippy yeah, there'll be no wedding bells for today

I've got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go riding merrily along
And they sing, oh, ain't you glad you're single?
And that song ain't so very far from wrong

Oh, Lillie Belle, oh, Lillie Belle
Though I may have done some fooling
This is why I never fell

I've got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go riding merrily along
And they sing, oh, ain't you glad you're single?
And that song ain't so very far from wrong

I've got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go riding merrily along
And they sing, oh, ain't you glad you're single?
And that song ain't so very far from wrong

Oh, Sally Jane, oh, Sally Jane
Though I'd loved to stay forever
This is why I can't remain

I've got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go riding merrily along
And they sing, oh, ain't you glad you're single?
And that song ain't so very far from wrong

I've got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go riding merrily along
And they sing, oh, ain't you glad you're single?
And that song ain't so very far from wrong

Oh, Mary Ann, oh, Mary Ann
Though we've done some moonlight walking
This is why I up and ran

I've got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go riding merrily along
And they sing, oh, ain't you glad you're single?
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
And that song ain't so very far from wrong

So I jingle, jangle, jingle all along
