[Verse 1]
Girl, I’ve always loved you, but something’s changed
Blame it on time, the road or the ride, but it ain’t the same
It’s a different kind of feeling, not the one I knew
From the sweet on your lips, to how your hand in mine fits
Girl I’ve always loved you but

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Verse 2]
What we got ain’t got no ending, like a band of solid gold
It’s sweeter with time like strawberry wine, it gets as good as it gets old
And oh, we thought we knew what it meant back then
But I keep fallin' all in higher than I’ve ever been, oh no, oh

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Break]
Oh no
Oh no, no-no

[Chorus]
I don’t love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It’s stronger the longer I’m with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no

[Outro]
Oh, oh
I don’t love you like I used to
Oh, oh, no
Love you like I used to
Love you like I used to, yeah
Oh, I don’t love you like I used to
