[Chorus: Forrest]
Flying high like the birds and the bees, and we’ll
Fill the sky with these songs in the trees, 'cause we’re
Buzzing, buzzing, and we’re humming, humming
And we’re loving, loving all day
Flying high like the birds and the bees, and we’ll
Feel alive while we float with the breeze, 'cause we’re
Buzzing, buzzing, and we’re humming, humming
And we’re loving, loving all day

[Verse 1: Forrest]
Feels good when I’m near you
I got the whole world in our rearview, but
When you’re here I can feel you, like
A summer day in June
Migrate from the bad times now
Love crimes never held me down
Weaving through all these grapevines
How we gonna find our truth?

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
This flight can take you higher
Rise above all your fires
Take you to your desires
Just follow me

[Chorus: Forrest]
Flying high like the birds and the bees, and we’ll
Fill the sky with these songs in the trees, 'cause we’re
Buzzing, buzzing, and we’re humming, humming
And we’re loving, loving all day
Flying high like the birds and the bees, and we’ll
Feel alive while we float with the breeze, 'cause we’re
Buzzing, buzzing, and we’re humming, humming
And we’re loving, loving all day

[Verse 2: Forrest]
Find your wings when you’re with me girl
Take a trip we could feel this world
Leave it all watch your life uncurl
Let these moments move
Love deeper than the blue that you see now
Way above all the seas with our wings out
Good times, yeah, we got ’em on speed dial
Sun shining through

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
This flight can take you higher
Rise above all your fires
Take you to your desires
Just follow me

[Chorus: Forrest]
Flying high like the birds and the bees, and we’ll
Fill the sky with these songs in the trees, 'cause we’re
Buzzing, buzzing, and we’re humming, humming
And we’re loving, loving all day
Flying high like the birds and the bees, and we’ll
Feel alive while we float with the breeze, 'cause we’re
Buzzing, buzzing, and we’re humming, humming
And we’re loving, loving all day

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
This flight can take you higher
Rise above all your fires
Take you to your desires
Just follow me

[Chorus: Forrest]
Flying high like the birds and the bees, and we’ll
Fill the sky with these songs in the trees, 'cause we’re
Buzzing, buzzing, and we’re humming, humming
And we’re loving, loving all day
Flying high like the birds and the bees, and we’ll
Feel alive while we float with the breeze, 'cause we’re
Buzzing, buzzing, and we’re humming, humming
And we’re loving, loving all day

[Verse 3: Forrest]
You’re my honey in the summer trees
Spreading love just like some bumblebees
And I know you’re coming back to me
Loving in the first degree
I know even when the sun goes down
And the seasons start to go around
And the colors go from green to brown
You’ll fly back to me
