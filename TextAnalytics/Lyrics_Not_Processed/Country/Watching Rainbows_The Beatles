Standing in the garden waiting for the sun to shine
Hand me my umbrella when she says she wish she was mine
Everybody does think a thing it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some

Standing in the garden waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Looking at the bench of next door neighbors
Crying to my mom of diamond tooth sabers
Everybody's got to have something hard to hold
Well instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son and make you one
You gotta get out son and make you one

Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry cry I know
Shoot big
Shoot big

Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big
You gotta shoot big
Until you shoot big

I can't stand it
