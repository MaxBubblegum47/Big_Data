[Verse 1]
Well if I had a dollar for every time you let me down
Stood me up, gave me the run around I'd still spend it all on you
We used to get so dressed up just to get so messed up
Chilling in the back of the club all night like we're all alone
But that girls gone

[Chorus]
So give it me straight babe, I can take it
If there's another guy just tell me why
You've been runnin' late babe every single day, every single night
Give it to me straight baby

[Refrain]
Who ya been with is there something to it?
Are you just friends with him?
I ain't mad at ya
I'm just asking
Just asking

[Verse 2]
Well tell me what you thinking just tell me anything at all
Say a word or say it all
I gotta hear it straight from you
We used to get so caught up
Getting spent and making love
The kind of love where we both end up on the bedroom floor
But it ain't no more

[Chorus]
So give it me straight babe, I can take it
If there's another guy just tell me why
You've been runnin' late babe every single day, every single night
Give it to me straight baby

[Refrain]
Who ya been with is there something to it?
Are you just friends with him?
I ain't mad at ya
I'm just asking
Just asking

[Chorus]
What you been doing?
And who ya been with?
Is there something to it?
Are you just friends with him?
I ain't mad at ya
I'm just asking
Oohh

[Outro]
So give it me straight babe, I can take it
If there's another guy just tell me why
You've been runnin' late babe every single day, every single night
Give it to me straight baby
