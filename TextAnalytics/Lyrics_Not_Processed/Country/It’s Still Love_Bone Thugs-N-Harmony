[Intro: Bizzy]
Yes indeed
We thank God for the opportunity, and the grace, in this New World Order
Nine nine nine nine nine, yes indeed
As we learn precious gifts and mosiac law
And the sons of Aaron sing
We are men, we are men

[Hook: Bizzy Bone]
Okay, we keepin the Sabbath holy
And okay, we have to recognize the Lord's homies
And okay, ashes to ashes, dust to dust and plus the bust must be love
It don't matter if you Crip or you Blood, you still loved
Uh-uh, we keepin the Sabbath holy
And okay, we have to recognize the Lord's homies
And okay, ashes to ashes, dust to dust and plus the bust must be love
It don't matter if you Crip or you Blood, it's still love, uh-huh

[Bizzy Bone]
When the dark side turns into light
And grown men get shookin lookin, they scared of the night
And mother-errt keep a pistol in they pocket for protection
Can't shoot invisible forces, keep the courses of that, resurrection
Have you ever been hurt or lied with nails from Jinn?
Have you ever been raped, and raped, and raped again?
Have you ever been beat in yo' sleep for fightin the devil?
Have you ever been lonely, alone, but still on that level with God?
There's never a problem, say my prayers like Abel
At least as close as I can, little brother's a rebel
A new label, couple of dollars, pay my bills and we bounce
If it, wasn't for Jesus I wouldn't be known, no doubt
For all whose in attendance, remembrance and love
I said it hurts to be couped and cool, like a dove
I said it's simple to crush your amp, but it's much simpler to sway
We was taught to be kind and humble and stay, out of the way

[Hook]

[Bizzy Bone]
There are many things that are sacred and many things that we cherish
As I write this I'm being so careful to not be careless
Where's the only begotten? B is with me
I speak to him and he speaks with me when everyone is leavin me
But, we've gotta have fun, without the presence I'm hurt
I'm ready for work, and I'm tryin, we can all change the world
Here's what I pray, here's the garden, we need some special attention
And not to mention we can party with the best of 'em, best of 'em
Rest of 'em beautiful too, please {?} do
Young Islamic brother, you with Christ, the world is cool
Do what, ever the Lord tells you, and the reward is good
Even if you have to live back in the hood, and shake your wood

[Hook]

[Bizzy Bone]
I'm walkin with the only begotten, never forgotten
Shed tears for mistakes that I've made, so dirty rotten
I'm not a king, never was, I'm just a slave and a servant
I love the light and I shall pass, angels, closed curtains
New king, tribe of Benjamin, help me succeed
I'm star rockin Abraham, somebody please take the lead
So wherever Jesus go, I follow because I love him
On the right hand of granddad and none is above him
All the brothers in the temple teach me right in the struggle
I can't imagine not existin at least, for a couple
It's trouble in these muddy waters, everyone know
Probably the stitches certain levels, love yourself and now grow
I see impatient truly help you make you rich and successful
So many people need a spirit, and this world is a cesspool
Test you, bless you, love you, address you
Huh, ain't no adultery, hey

[Hook]
