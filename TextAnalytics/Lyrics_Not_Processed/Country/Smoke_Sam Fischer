[Verse 1]
Mama, sit down let me tell you some'
I know that you worry about me
Mama, I won't give you the runaround
So let me put your mind at ease
These streets, they lead me
To the green peace, that free speech

[Chorus]
So I smoke to remind me that I won't ever get to see this day again
'Cause nobody's getting younger
So I smoke 'cause she laughs at all my jokes when we're higher than we've ever been
Going silent as we wonder what's it all for if it isn't for now?
Open the doors and let it all out
So I smoke, yeah yeah I smoke
Yeah yeah I smoke

[Verse 2]
Mama, come over here and take a hit
I know you been kinda stressed
Three kids, Lord knows you been through some shit
You deserve a little rest
So breathe deep, take it slowly
And you'll see why this works for me

[Chorus]
And I smoke to remind me that I won't ever get to see this day again
'Cause nobody's getting younger
So I smoke 'cause she laughs at all my jokes when we're higher than we've ever been
Going silent as we wonder what's it all for if it isn't for now?
Open the doors and let it all out
So I smoke, yeah yeah I smoke
Yeah yeah we smoke
Yeah yeah we smoke
Yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
Breathe deep, take it slowly
And you'll see why this works for me

[Chorus]
And I smoke to remind me that I won't ever get to see this day again
'Cause nobody's getting younger
So I smoke 'cause she laughs at all my jokes when we're higher than we've ever been
Going silent as we wonder what's it all for if it isn't for now?
Open the doors and let it all out
So I smoke, yeah yeah I smoke
Yeah yeah we smoke
Yeah yeah we smoke
Yeah yeah yeah
