[Verse 1: HARDY]
17 in a small town
Weak knees in a CVS
Door locked in the bathroom
What's it gonna be waitin' on that test?
Never thought that they'd be
Puttin' those life plans on the shelf
A couple American babies raisin' one up their self

[Chorus: All]
One beer turns into a lit cigarette
Burnin' into a two beer buzz
Three beers turns into five and six
Then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck
Just like that, everything rearranges
Life changes out of the blue
It's just a Bud Light, but ain't it funny
What one beer can turn into?

[Verse 2: Devin Dawson & 
Lauren Alaina
]
Sesame Street on the TV
A race car rollin' on a cardboard bridge
Crayon stick figure family
Stuck right there front center on the fridge
Flash back to two pink lines
A whole bunch of prayin' and doubtin'
Felt like the end of the world
Now the world don't spin without 'em (
Hey, yeah
)
Oh, 'cause

[Chorus: All & 
Lauren Alaina
]
One beer turns into a lit cigarette
Burnin' into a two beer buzz
Three beers turns into five and six
Then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck
(
In the back of that truck
)
Just like that, everything rearranges
Life changes out of the blue
It's just a Bud Light, but ain't it funny
What one beer can turn into?

[Bridge: HARDY & 
Lauren Alaina
]
A boy and a girl and a three on the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
First comes lust, then the shotgun marriage
Six months later come a baby in a carriage
You know what, y'all? You know what, y'all?
The whole thing started with some alcohol
The whole thing started with some alcohol (
Hey, yeah
)

[Chorus: All & 
HARDY
]
One beer turns into a lit cigarette
Burnin' into a two beer buzz (
Into a two beer buzz
)
Three beers turns into five and six
Then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck
Just like that, everything rearranges
Life changes out of the blue
It's just a Bud Light, but ain't it funny
What one beer can turn into?

A boy and a girl and a three on the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G (
Oh
)
First comes lust, then the shotgun marriage
Six months later come a baby in a carriage
That's not all
 (
Nah
), 
that's not all
 (
Nah
)
Here we go again, drinkin' alcohol, 
yeah
