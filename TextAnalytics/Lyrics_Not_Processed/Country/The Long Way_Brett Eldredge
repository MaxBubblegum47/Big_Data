[Verse 1]
Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty
Wandering around this midnight mad house city
You got a look that says you've got it all together
So if you don't mind, I'd like to know you better

[Chorus]
Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

[Verse 2]
I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in Clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive

[Chorus]
Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

[Bridge]
Didn't think tonight when I walked in
I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been

[Chorus]
Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want your red blushing stories
Your faults and your glories
That made you who you are right now
Take me the long way around
Take me the long way around
