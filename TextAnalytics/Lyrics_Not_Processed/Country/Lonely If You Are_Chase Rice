[Verse 1]
If it's Friday you know I'll be
Kickin' back with the boys down at Santa's pub
But don't hesitate, don't even think about waiting, nah just type it up
Yeah, I'm ready if you're ready or wonderin'
Stop thinking, hit send

[Chorus]
Doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
A little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, nah
It could be A.M. or P.M.  
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are, yeah
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are

[Verse 2]
If it's Monday and it's over
You know the show your girls all come over for
And the red wine's getting lower
And your last friend's out the door
When there's no more roses to go around
Hit me up girl, you know I'm down

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
A little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, nah
It could be A.M. or P.M.  
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are

[Bridge]
Oh, let me love the lonely right out of you
Oh, let me love the lonely right out of you
Oh yeah, if you're out there and lonely, girl, I'm lonely, too
So let me love the lonely right out of you

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
Little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, no
It could be A.M. or P.M.  
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are, yeah
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are, yeah
Oh, I'm lonely if you are
