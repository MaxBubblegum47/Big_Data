[Verse 1]
Since I can remember
Since I was a child
You gave me all you could and all you had
Now that I am older and now that I am grown
I see how hard you worked to make our house a home

[Chorus]
If I turn out half the man you are I’ll be happy with my life
Show me how to raise a family, and how to treat a wife
You put food on the table so that I was able
To follow every one of my dreams
If I turn out half the man you are, I’ll be doing alright

[Verse 2]
You said don’t let life get in your way
That would never get me down
Love as if there’s no tomorrow to stand to be a man
I can’t always make it easy but I’ll always lend a hand
Through whatever comes together you and I will understand

[Chorus]
If I turn out half the man you are I’ll be happy with my life
Show me how to raise a family and how to treat a wife
You put food on the table so that I was able
To follow every one of my dreams
If I turn out half the man you are I’ll be doing alright

[Bridge]
And I know that I’m still hurting
But I hope I make you proud
At the man that I’m becoming and the man I am now
And I know that I’ll keep learning
Never told you this before
You’re not only just a father
To me you’re so much more
To me you’re so much more

[Chorus]
If I turn out half the man you are I’ll be happy with my life
Show me how to raise a family and how to treat a wife
You put food on the table so that I was able
To follow every one of my dreams
If I turn out half the man you are I’ll be doing alright

[Post-Chorus]
And I love, l love, I love, I love
I love, I love you so
And I love, l love, I love, I love
I love, I love you so

[Outro]
And I know that I'll keep learning
