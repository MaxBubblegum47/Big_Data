[Verse 1]
I threw a rock in the lake and it sank to the bottom
The waves spread out but the rock got forgotten
The ripples came back just as we feared
Looking for the rock but the hole disappeared
It's somewhere in the middle some way down
The last guy that went looking almost certainly drowned

[Chorus]
He ran out of time
He can kiss tomorrow goodbye

[Verse 2]
Yes I piss in the water and burn down trees
I watch as the creatures fall to their knees
They haven't got a clue as disaster looms
They're too busy choking on toxic fumes
They got no hope and there's no point running
No matter what they do I keep on coming

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I did a bad thing
I did a bad thing
I did a bad thing
I did a bad thing

[Chorus]
Well hallelujah and holy mackerel
All we got left is a thief and a jackal
The writing is big and it's there on the wall
Oh how the mighty empires fall
There's nothing to fix it's much too late
Sit down and prepare to meet your fate

[Chorus]
