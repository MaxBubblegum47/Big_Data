[Verse 1]
I've been your lover, I've been your friend
I've been your faithful one-woman man
I've been your diamond in the rough
Now you say you wanna polish me up

[Chorus]
Why, why, why do you want to change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missing the old me around
So why, why, why do you want to change me now

[Verse 2]
I remember you used to like
Walking with me on my wilder side
My kind of crazy turned you on
Do you really want that part of me gone?

[Chorus]
Why, why, why do you want to change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missing the old me around
So why, why, why do you want to change me now

[Bridge]
Why, why, why
Ain't I the one?
You might start missing

[Chorus]
Why, why, why do you want to change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missing the old me around
So why, why, why do you want to change me now
