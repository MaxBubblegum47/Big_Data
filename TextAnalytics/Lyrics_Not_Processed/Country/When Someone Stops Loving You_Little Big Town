[Verse 1]
Still gotta walk into a crowded room
With the radio on
Crack a smile and crack a beer like it don't bother you
Like it ain't your song, that's on

[Pre-Chorus]
Still gotta cross the bridge to get to work
The one by her place
Make it through the 9 to 5 like it don't hurt
It goes that way

[Chorus]
When someone stops loving you
It don't make the evening news
It don't keep the sun from rising, the clock from winding
Your heart from beating, even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you

[Verse 2]
Still gotta button up your collared shirt
The one she used to button down
Sleep on the mattress where her body left a curve
Or maybe just the couch

[Pre-Chorus]
Still gotta keep her number in your phone
In case she calls back
One night when she's drunk and all alone
Yeah you pray for that

[Chorus]
When someone stops loving you
It don't make the evening news
It don't keep the sun from rising, the clock from winding
Your heart from beating, even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you

[Bridge]
The hardest part about it is
There ain't a switch that you can flip
'Cause you can't stop loving them

[Outro]
When someone stops loving you
When someone stops loving you
It don't keep the sun from rising, the clock from winding
Your heart from beating, even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you
When someone stops loving you
When someone stops loving you
