[Intro: Beckett Hayes]
My name’s Beckett and I’m 4

[Verse 1]
Well cereal's his favorite food group
Doin’ the Heisman with a box of Fruit Loops
Spoon hangin' off his nose just cuz he can
Bedhead like Edward Scissorhands
Damn proud of that belly button
Ain’t suckin' it in for nothin’
4 years old looks like fun to me

[Chorus]
When I grow up I wanna be like Beckett
Eatin' breakfast butt naked
Ain’t even tryin’ to be famous
Just wonderin' where his airplane is
Don’t know if he’s rich or poor
Says it’s cool that the girl next door
Has skin like chocolate
When I grow up, when I grow up
I wanna be like Beckett

[Beckett: "Where’s my airplane? I like the fat Froot Loops"]

You get it, B

[Verse 2]
Shakes it when there ain’t no music
Takes advantage of the bathtub acoustics
Little Foo Fighter with a shampoo mohawk
Owns it with no alcohol
Don’t know the minute hand from the hour
I see a weed, he sees a flower
Prays like he’s on the phone with Jesus

[Chorus]
When I grow up I wanna be just like Beckett
Eatin' breakfast butt naked
Ain’t even tryin’ to be famous
Just wonderin' where is airplane is
Don’t know if he’s rich or poor
Says it’s cool that the boy next door
Has two dads and three pets
When I grow up, when I grow up
I wanna be like Beckett

[Beckett: "Where’s my airplane? I like the fat Froot Loops"]

Wanna be just like you, Beck
Come on, B
He likes the fat Froot Loops

When I grow up, when I grow up
I wanna be like Beckett
Eatin’ breakfast butt naked
Ain’t even tryin’ to be famous
Just wonderin’ where his airplane is
Don’t know if he’s rich or poor
Says it’s cool that the girl next door
Has a dot on her forehead
When I grow up, when I grow up
I wanna be like Beckett

[Beckett: "Where’s my airplane? I like the fat Froot Loops"]

Wanna be like you, Beck
You get it, get it, that's right
He likes the fat Froot Loops
