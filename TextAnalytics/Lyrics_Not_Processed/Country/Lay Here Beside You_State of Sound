[Verse 1]
Something inside
Coming to life as you open my eyes
When we're together, we're together
Leading me right
Into a new way of being alive
Now stay forever, stay forever
And I've been living a lie
Chilling my mind with the freedom inside
Now that I see you, that I see you
I'm sick of tonight
And tired of dreaming, I'm letting the feeling
Take me over, so take me over

[Pre-Chorus]
And the way you look deep in my eyes
I don't know what to say
You pull me close, I've got no choice
I let you lead the way
And give into the feeling, there's a fire in my mind
Take me down so easy

[Chorus]
And I just wanna lay here beside you
And I just wanna lay here beside you

[Verse 2]
Setting me free
Cutting the shame, getting rid of my pain
And be myself now, be myself now
You saw that I need
Wanna burn up a lost, there's nothing but us
I let it take me over, so take me over

[Pre-Chorus]
And the way you look deep in my eyes
I don't know what to say
You pull me close, I've got no choice
I let you lead the way
And give into the feeling, there's a fire in my mind
Take me down so easy

[Chorus]
And I just wanna lay here beside you
And I just wanna lay here beside you

[Bridge]
And the way you look deep in my eyes
I don't know what to say
You pull me close, I've got no choice
I let you lead the way
And give into the feeling, there's a fire in my mind
Take me down so easy

[Chorus]
And I just wanna lay here beside you
And I just wanna lay here beside you
