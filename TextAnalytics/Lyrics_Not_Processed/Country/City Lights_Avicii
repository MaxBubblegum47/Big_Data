[Verse 1]
City lights, take me away
Now it's time, we never ever head down
Don't be scared, I am for real
Hide away and we will never be found

[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright, we never look back
Birds will sing if we fall
It's alright, with memories inside
Midnight dust on the floor
Watch it turn into gold

[Chorus]
And I don't even know what's real
And I don't know what to feel
I'm your truth in disguise, I'm in love with your lies
'Cause I can't breathe, can't settle down
And I don't know what to feel
No, I don't know what to feel

[Verse 2]
See these lights, we're getting away
Heads won't find us, we're not making a sound
We're not scared, we are for real
Love can't hurt us, now we're sheltered by lies

[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright, we never look back
Birds will sing if we fall
It's alright, with memories inside
Midnight dust on the floor
Watch it turn into gold

[Chorus]
And I don't even know what's real
And I don't know what to feel
I'm your truth in disguise, I'm in love with your lies
'Cause I can't breathe, can't settle down
And I don't know what to feel
No, I don't know what to feel
