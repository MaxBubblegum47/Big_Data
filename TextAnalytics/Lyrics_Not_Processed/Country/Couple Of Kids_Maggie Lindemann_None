[Verse 1]
Take me back to the night, we met in the yard
Climbing up to the roof, hidden in the dark
With a bottle of wine for two, though I'm already drunk off you
Then we both fell asleep, underneath the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
We're young and naive, and you're tellin' me
That someday we'll run off together
I'm startin' to think, I'm stuck in a dream
Cause we're young and we don't know better

[Chorus]
Now I'm fallin' heavily, recklessly
Trying not to lose my sensibility
But gravity, it pulls me into you
We're just a couple of kids
We're just a couple of kids
Sneakin' out late for a kiss
Cause we're just a couple of kids

[Verse 2]
When I'm wrapped in your arms, I never feel a thing
Livin' life on a whim, it's never a routine
And it's troubling to live this way
When you never know where you'll stay
But we live and we learn, and I wouldn't change a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
We're young and naive, and you're tellin' me
That someday we'll run off together
I'm startin' to think, I'm stuck in a dream
Cause we're young and we don't know better

[Chorus]
Now I'm fallin' heavily, recklessly
Trying not to lose my sensibility
But gravity, it pulls me into you
We're just a couple of kids
We're just a couple of kids
Sneakin' out late for a kiss
Cause we're just a couple of kids
Cause we're just a couple of kids

[Outro]
Now I'm fallin' heavily, recklessly
Trying not to lose my sensibility
But gravity, it pulls me into you
We're just a couple of kids
We're just a couple of kids
Sneakin' out late for a kiss
Cause we're just a couple of kids
