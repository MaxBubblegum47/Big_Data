[Verse 1-Garth Brooks]
Well turn that bottle up and drink it
Crank that jukebox up and Hank it
Bartender, pour another round
Here's to our best bad decisions
Situation no conditions
Oh and memories we all need to drown
So fill your cup
Raise it up
Jump in and join the club
And float this whiskey river reservoir

[Chorus]
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

[Verse 2-Blake Shelton]
'Cause up in here you're not the only loved and left her lost and lonely one who's ever swam against the tide
Thinkin' this is your oasis
It's the safest of the places
That a broken heart can find to hide
So here's a toast coast to coast
With a big old adios to wishes wasted on them falling stars

[Chorus]
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

[Bridge]
Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
For some bar stool believers
Wear our heart out on our sleevers
Just going where the neon glows

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
Yeah we're just never quite belongers
Hanger on-ers way too longers
Just buzzing where the neon glows

[Pre-Chorus-Both]
Problems, we all got 'em
Let 'em sink down to the bottom
Doesn't matter who or where you are

[Chorus]
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end
The water's fine, ya'll so just come on in
To the deep end of a dive bar
