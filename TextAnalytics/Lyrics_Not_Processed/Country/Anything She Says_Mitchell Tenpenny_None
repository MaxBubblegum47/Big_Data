[Verse 1]
She says she likes to dance
She loves to make friends with my friends
She don't give a damn what anyone thinks when
She says she's gonna maybe wanna
Get drunk get waffles at two in the morning
If she want it yeah she got it
Cause she got me like that

[Chorus]
I would wreck all of my plans
Drive until we hit the sands
Catch sunburn while she tans
I would do, I would do
I'd do whatever she likes
Give her Christmas in July
She ain't gotta tell me twice
I would do, I would do anything

[Verse 2]
She says she likes it when I hold her hand while they're
Watching yeah, all eyes on us
She got all my attention
She knows I'm always listening
Hanging off her lips yeah
Cause she got me like that

[Chorus]
I would wreck all of my plans
Drive until we hit the sands
Catch a sunburn while she tans
I would do, I would do
I'd do whatever she likes
Give her Christmas in July
She ain't gotta tell me twice
I would do, I would do anything
Oh anything she says
Oh, anything she says

[Bridge]
I would up and take a chance
Have a talk with her old man
Put a diamond on her hand
I would do, I'd do anything yeah

[Chorus]
I would wreck all of my plans
Drive until we hit the sands
Catch a sunburn while she tans
I would do, I would do
I'd do whatever she likes
Give her Christmas in July
She ain't gotta tell me twice
I would do, I would do anything

[Outro]
Oh anything she says
Anything she says
She says
Just tell me what to do
Just tell me what to do
