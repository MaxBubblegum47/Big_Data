[Verse 1]
Strawberry wine on your lips got me amazed
How 'bout you let this cowboy take you away?
Gimme that wink, I'ma give it right back
You know you like it, you love it, you want some more of that

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me smile like I did when we were radio kids
Catching that countdown on Sunday, all the way to one day

[Chorus]
Whenever
Do you love me? If you do, check yes, please
Girl, you know you think my tractor's sexy
Got me spinning like a jukebox junkie
Making me feel like 90's country
You make me feel like 90's country
Shake it vidalia
Queen of my double wide trailer
Million songs I could list you
But I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you

[Verse 2]
You see that water tower? Girl, we can dream on it
I'ma paint your name in John Deere green on it
I, I cross my heart, I ain't no walk-away Joe
I'm gonna get you to the church on Cumberland Road

[Pre-Chorus]
And you get sweeter with time
Just like that bottle of wine
Might be a little dust on it but
Won't it taste so fine? (Just like you)

[Chorus]
Do you love me? If you do, check yes, please
Girl, you know you think my tractor's sexy
I'm sold to the lady in the front seat
Making me feel like 90's country
You make me feel like 90's country
Shake it vidalia
Queen of my double wide trailer
Million songs I could list you
But I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you
You make me feel like 90's country

[Bridge]
You know you're beautiful, don't act like you don't
Ain't settling for no burger and no grape snow cone, not tonight

[Chorus]
Do you love me? If you do, check yes, please
Girl, you know you think my tractor's sexy
I ain't in it for your daddy's money
You make me feel like 90's country
You make me feel like 90's country
Shake it vidalia
Queen of my double wide trailer
Million songs I could list you
But I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you
Baby, don't be stupid, you know I love you
Blame it all on my roots when I turned up at 90's country
