[Verse 1]
It's the end of the night
I find myself kissing you goodbye
Trying like hell to pull this truck out of your driveway
If I make it down the street
And that red light is almost green
Just a couple left turns
And I'll be flying down the highway

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, can't stop thinking about you
I know I'm gonna end up

[Chorus]
Back standing on your front porch
Back knocking on your front way
Back into those save me arms
Only you could make me feel like that
Back getting all twisted up
Back with it on the tip of my tongue
About to say something, say something
Something I can't take back

[Verse 2]
There ain't no way to know
What you're gonna say when I let it go
But my heart's finally talked my head into letting me
Say what's been running 'round my mind
Each and every time
I get my arms around you
You got a way of getting me

[Chorus]
Back standing on your front porch
Back knocking on your front way
Back into those save me arms
Only you could make me feel like that
Back getting all twisted up
Back with it on the tip of my tongue
About to say something, say something
Something I can't take back
Oh, something I can't take back

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, can't stop thinking about you

[Chorus]
Back standing on your front porch
Back knocking on your front way
Back into those save me arms
Only you could make me feel like that
Back getting all twisted up
Back with it on the tip of my tongue
About to say something, say something
Something I can't take back
Right here in your save me arms
About to say something I can't take back

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, can't stop thinking about you
