[Verse 1: Christian Zucconi)
I didn't ask for this
You give me heart attacks
I didn't want to care
And then I saw you there
Been working like a dog
I turned all my dreams off
I didn't know my name, I didn't know my name

[Chorus: Hannah Hooper & Christian Zucconi)
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)

[Bridge: Hannah Hooper]
Even when I can't see my rearview
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day, even when I sleep all day
Even if I'm working like I'm times two
Living in the back of a boat just like we do
Even when I dream all day

[Verse 2: Christian Zucconi]
Don't wanna sleep tonight
You've got me feeling right
I didn't know my name, I didn't know my name

[Chorus: Hannah Hooper & Christian Zucconi)
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)

[Bridge: Hannah Hooper]
Even when I can't see my rearview
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day, even when I sleep all day
Even if I work it like I'm times two
Living in the back of the bunk just like we do
Even when I dream all day, even when I dream all day

[Chorus 2: Hannah Hooper & Christian Zucconi]
Oh I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh

[Bridge: Hannah Hooper]
Even when I smoke in the backroom
Even if I call just to meet you
Even when I sleep all day, even when I sleep all day
Even if I'm working like I'm times two
Waiting for the day just to end to see you
Even when I dream all day, even when I dream all day
