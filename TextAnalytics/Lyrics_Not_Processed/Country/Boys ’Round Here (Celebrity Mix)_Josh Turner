[Intro: All]
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ol' Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At the honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night, what
(That's right)
Yea, and what they call work, digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
And your four wheel drive
(A country boy can survive)

[Chorus: Blake Shelton, All]
Yeah the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no lip
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Aw heck
Red red red red red red redneck

[Verse 2 - Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert]
Well the boys 'round here, they're keeping it country
Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
You don't do the dougie
No, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here yep, they still love me
Yea, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
For the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no lip
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

[Bridge: Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert, reba McEntire, All]
Let me hear you say
Ooh let's ride
To the country side
Ooh let's ride
Down to the river side
Hey now girl, hop inside Ooh let's ride
Me and you gonna take a little ride to the river Ooh let's ride
Let's ride, that's right
Lay a blanket on the ground Ooh let's ride
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound
We out of town Ooh let's ride
Have you ever got down with a
Red red red red red red redneck Ooh let's ride
And do you wanna get down with a
Red red red red red red redneck Ooh let's ride
Girl you gotta get down

[Chorus: Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert, All]
With the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no lip
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Aw heck
Ooh let's ride
Red red red red red red redneck
Ooh let's ride

[Outro: Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert, All]
I'm one of them boys 'round here

Red red red red red red redneck

Well all I'm thinkin' 'bout is you and me and how we'll be Ooh let's ride
Ooh let's ride
So come on girl, hop inside Ooh let's ride
Me and you, we're gonna take a little ride
Ooh let's ride
Lay a blanket on the ground Ooh let's ride
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound
We out of town, yeah Ooh let's ride
Ooh let's ride
Girl you gotta get down with a
Ooh let's ride
Ooh let's ride
Come on through the country side
Ooh let's ride
Down to the river side
