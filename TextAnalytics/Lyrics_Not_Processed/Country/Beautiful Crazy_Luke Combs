[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me
