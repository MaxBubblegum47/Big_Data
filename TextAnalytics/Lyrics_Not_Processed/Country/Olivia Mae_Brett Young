[Verse 1]
Olivia, may I get to know ya?
Buy you a coffee or a drink sometime next week
Olivia, maybe I could call you
Olivia, what do ya think?
Yeah, what do ya think?

[Chorus]
'Cause Olivia Mae, I saw you standing there
Laughing, playing with your hair
Looking like you walked out of a dream
Olivia Mae, I hope it ain't just me
From where I'm standing I can see
Us finding our own kind of meant to be
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
But I just had to try
Olivia, may I?
Olivia, may I?

[Verse 2]
Olivia Mae, I've fallen for you
The past year with you has been the best year of my life
And Olivia Mae, I think I love you
And I hope that that's alright
Tell me that's alright

[Chorus]
'Cause Olivia Mae, I saw you standing there
Laughing, playing with your hair
Looking like you walked out of a dream
Olivia Mae, I hope it ain't just me
From where I'm standing I can see
Us finding our own kind of meant to be
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
But I just had to try
Olivia, may I?
Oh may I?

[Bridge]
Olivia, may I ask you a question?
What are you doing for the rest of your life?

[Chorus]
'Cause Olivia Mae, I see you standing there
The sunlight shining through your hair
No one ever looked so good in white
Olivia Mae, I'm glad it ain't just me
From where I'm standing I can see
The girl I'm meant to love for my whole life
And I know that I won't always get it right
But I promise I'll try
I promise I'll try
Olivia, may I?
Olivia, may I?
Olivia, may I?
