[Verse 1]
Just look at her sittin' there
Sweatpants, t-shirt, in her comfy chair, hmm
Her hair in a bun, one hand on a mug
And the other one’s playin' snare
To a George Strait vinyl, that yes-or-no line will get her close
But I don't think she can understand
Just how far I’ve been lettin' my heart fall
But what's in my head

[Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

[Post-Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don’t know, well, she don’t know
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don’t know, well, she don't know

[Verse 2]
Well, she don't know I already bought a ring
Hid it in the bottom left drawer, right beside the sink
A shiny emerald diamond on a brand-new band
Asked her mama for permission and her daddy for her hand

[Chorus]
I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin’ like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

[Post-Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know

[Bridge]
Well, here I go
'Cause right now, we're back in her hometown
And I'm down on one knee
I guess she finally figured out
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

[Chorus]
I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

[Post-Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know
