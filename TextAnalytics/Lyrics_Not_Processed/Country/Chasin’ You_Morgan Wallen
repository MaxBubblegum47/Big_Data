[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Outro]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you
