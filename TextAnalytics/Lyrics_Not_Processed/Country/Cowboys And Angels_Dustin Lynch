[Verse 1]
There's a want and there's a need
There's a history between
Girls like her and guys like me
Cowboys and angels

[Verse 2]
I've got boots and she's got wings
I'm hell on wheels and she's heavenly
I'd die for her and she lives for me
Cowboys and angels

[Chorus]
We ride side by side
A cloud of dust, a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
She's sweet, I'm wild, we're dangerous
Cowboys and angels

[Verse 3]
I'm not sure why her path crossed mine
Accident or grand design
Oh, maybe God just kinda likes
Cowboys and angels

[Chorus]
We ride side by side
A cloud of dust, a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
She's sweet, I'm wild, we're dangerous
Cowboys and angels

[Outro]
There's a want and there's a need
There's a history between
Girls like you and guys like me
Cowboys and angels
Cowboys and angels
