[Verse 1]
I didn't think I was a bad guy
I knew that you were good
You were golden on the inside
And you loved me the best you could
I'm the one who dropped the ball
Got you high and let you fall
Let the best thing I ever had slip away

[Chorus]
What does that say about me
That I could do you like I did
That I could break an angel's wings
What does that say about me
That I stood there like a fencepost
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me
Now that I've broke your pretty heart
Your pretty heart

[Verse 2]
I've been drinking like a drunkard
In these Austin neon light
Burning smoke and wondering
If there's anything I've done right
Well I wish that I could go back
Hang on to what I had
Guess that's all, babe
Nothing but a dream

[Chorus]
What does that say about me
That I could do you like I did
That I could break an angel's wings
What does that say about me
That I stood there like a fencepost
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me
Now that I've broke your pretty heart
Your pretty heart

[Chorus]
What does that say about me
That I could do you like I did
That I could break an angel's wings
What does that say about me
That I stood there like a fencepost
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me
Now that I've broke your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
