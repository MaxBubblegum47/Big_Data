[Verse 1]
I was missing the guys (I was missing the guys)
In my rented apartment
You would think I'd have realised
But I didn't for quite sometime
Started wetting my eyes (Started wetting my eyes)
'Cause I'm soft in that department
Right then I realised
You're the love of my life

[Chorus]
The moment that you took my hand
Was the best thing that ever happened, yeah
The moment that we started a band
Was the best thing that ever happened
And I wish that we could do it again
It was the best thing that ever happened to me
It was the best thing that ever happened to me
It was the best thing that ever happened

[Verse 2]
I took a zoot outside
In my coat's secret compartment
I hear a song and start to cry
Pretend it's smoke that's in my eye
I don't know why I'm surprised
'Cause we all shared one apartment
Man, they were the golden times
They were the best of my life

[Chorus]
The moment that you took my hand (The moment that you took my hand)
Was the best thing that ever happened, yeah
The moment that we started a band (The moment that we started a band)
Was the best thing that ever happened
Oh, the first time we went to Japan (The first time we went to Japan)
Was the best thing that ever happened (The best thing)
And I wish that we could do it again
You guys are the best thing that ever happened to me
You guys are the best thing that ever happened to me
You guys are the best thing that ever happened
You guys are the best thing that ever happened to me
You guys are the best thing that ever happened
