[Verse 1]
I could tell you all about her
And what she did for me
I was swimming in the darkness
Till she set me free

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She opened up my heart
To a whole new love
I never knew was there
When it fell apart
And she left my arms
I was so unprepared

[Chorus]
What if I do
What if I don't
What if I'm feeling lonesome without you
What if I lose
Where would I go
What am I feeling lonesome without you

[Verse 2]
I could tell you all about him
The way he touched my face
I'd be throwing such a tantrum
But he could ease my pain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He opened up my heart
To a whole new love
I never knew was there
When it fell apart
And he left my arms
I was so unprepared

[Chorus]
What if I do
What if I don't
What if I'm feeling lonesome without you
What if I lose
Where would I go
Why am I feeling lonesome without you

[Bridge]
Gonna beg you to stay
Cause I know that you're the one
Don't you take that away
I know that you wanna quit
But I'm not ready to let go
Gonna bend til I break

[Chorus]
What if I do
What if I don't
What if I'm feeling lonesome without you
What if I lose
Where would I go
Why am I feeling lonesome without you

[Outro]
What if I do
What if I don't
What if I'm feeling lonesome without you
What if I lose
Where would I go
Why am I feeling lonesome without you
So lonesome without you
So lonesome without you
SO lonesome, so lonesome
So lonesome without you
No
