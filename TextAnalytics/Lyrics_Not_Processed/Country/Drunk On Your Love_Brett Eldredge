[Verse 1]
The second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peekin through the shades
I can't help but laugh cause I kind of like feelin' this way

[Chorus]
I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love love
Now I know why-y I'm feelin' so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

[Verse 2]
It's not in the whiskey, tequila or the wine
It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumblin' always stumblin' through a haze
I got plenty to do just laying here with you all day

[Chorus]
I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love love
Now I know why-y I'm feelin' so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

[Bridge]
Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singin' this song

[Chorus]
I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love love
Now I know why-y I'm feelin' so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

[Outro]
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love, (woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love (woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love (woke up still drunk on your love)
(woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love, on your love (woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love, get drunk on your love, yeah
I'm so drunk
