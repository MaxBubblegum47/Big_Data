[Verse: Gene and All]
The stars at night
Are big and bright
Deep in the heart of Texas

The prairie sky
Is wide and high
Deep in the heart of Texas

The coyotes wail
Along the trail
Deep in the heart of Texas

The rabbits rush
Around the brush
Deep in the heart of Texas

[Instrumental break]

[Verse: Gene and All]
The chicken hocks
Are full of squawks
Deep in the heart of Texas

The oil wells
Are full of smells
Deep in the heart of Texas

The cactus plants
Are tough on pants
Deep in the heart of Texas

That's why perhaps
They all wear chaps
Deep in the heart of Texas

[Instrumental break]

[Verse: Gene and All]
The cowboys cry
"Ka-yippie aye!" (Woo-hoo!)
Deep in the heart of Texas

The doggies bawl
And say "you all"
Deep in the heart of Texas

The cactus plants
Are tough on pants
Deep in the heart of Texas

That's why perhaps
They all wear chaps
Deep in the heart of Texas
