[Intro]
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 1]
Wheels rolling on an old Toyota
Twist top on a Sunkist soda
Your brown hair in the west coast wind
If heaven is anywhere
90â€™s hits at the top of our lungs
Shuffle landed on "Still the One"
Missing turns 'cause that's our song
If heaven is anywhere

[Chorus]
It's in a blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya

[Verse 2]
Red sun melting to the blacktop
Dollar shades from a nowhere truck stop
Your kiss and that coastline
If heaven is anywhere
Pull it over to the shoulder
To take it in
And pull you closer
Loving you longer than I ever did
Going places we never been
'Cause heaven's in

[Chorus]
A blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here

[Bridge]
Blue Tacoma, California
Rays of gold are shining on ya
If heaven is anywhere

[Chorus]
It's in a blue Tacoma, California
White magnolia in your hair
Rays of gold are shining on ya
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's never running out of golden road
Always having your hand to hold
In a blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
It's right here
Blue Tacoma, California
Ooh, if heaven is anywhere
Rays of gold are shining on ya
(I'm always right here, always right here oh-oh, ooh)
Blue Tacoma, California (Oh)
Rays of gold are shining on ya
If heaven is anywhere
