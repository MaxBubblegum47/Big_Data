When it's sugarcane time and around about June
I'll be walkin' with sugar neath that old sugar moon
All the lovin' I missed I'll be gettin' it soon
I'll be gettin' it from my sugar neath that old sugar moon
I can see us right now get the calendar down
Draw a circle around the day I'm all her around
When it's sugarcane time and around about June
Weddin' bells will be chimin' neath that old sugar moon
I can see her right now get the calendar down
Draw a circle around the day I'm all her around
When it's sugarcane time and around about June
Weddin' bells will be chimin' neath that old sugar moon
