Heyyah
Heyyah
Hey, heyyah

[Verse 1]
Barhoppers, churchgoers
Marlboro Light smokers
Blue collar, red voters
Population 1,009
Past year’s cheerleaders
Old men fill the bleachers
Skeptics, true believers all
Gathered on a Friday night
Singing to the stars and stripes

[Chorus]
We’re a drinking town with a football problem
With two main things we all have in common
We love ‘em both and don’t want to solve ‘em
We’re a drinking town with a football problem

Huh, heyyah
Singing, heyyah
Hey, heyyah


[Verse 2]
Barn burners, nail biters
Shift workers, firefighters
Prom queens, outsiders
All livin’ for the love of the game
We still tell the same old story
Relive former glory
Went to state in ‘94
We got a trophy in the school hallway
The kids pass it by each day

[Chorus]
We’re a drinking town with a football problem
With two main things we all have in common
We love ‘em both and don’t want to solve ‘em
We’re a drinking town with a football problem

Hey, hey

[Bridge]
When we win, we celebrate
And when we lose, we commiserate
Win or lose, oh we tie one on

[Chorus]
We’re a drinking town with a football problem
With two main things we all have in common
We love ‘em both and don’t want to solve ‘em
We’re a drinking town with a football problem

Hey, say
Heyyah (hey yeah)
Heyyah
Hey, heyyah, wow yeah
