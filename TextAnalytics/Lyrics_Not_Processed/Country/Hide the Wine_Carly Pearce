[Verse 1]
I heard you were back in town
Well it's been a hot minute since me and you were hanging out
Yeah we had that crazy kind of chemistry
Where you get burned, don't learn, don't care
Just reach for another match and gasoline

[Pre-Chorus]
Knock knock, here you come a-knockin' on my door
But you're gonna have to wait on the porch

[Chorus]
Better hide the wine
And get it gone
I better hide every one of them records that turn me on
(Lock 'em up, lock 'em up)
Turn up the lights
And kill the mood
Because baby I just don't trust myself with you
I better hide the wine

[Verse 2]
Well I know me and I know you
I better get rid of all the Two Buck Chuck
And the high-dollar good stuff too
'Cause baby if I don't, then you know what we'll do
One sip, one tip, we'll be sitting on the couch
You'll be kicking off your shoes

[Chorus]
Better hide the wine
And get it gone
I better hide every one of them records that turn me on
(Lock 'em up, lock 'em up)
Turn up the lights
And kill the mood
Because baby I just don't trust myself with you
I better hide the wine
I better hide the wine, yeah

[Bridge]
Knock knock here you come a-knockin' on my door
But you're gonna have to wait another minute on the porch
Oh no, no, it's a dangerous thing pouring alcohol on an old flame

[Chorus]
Better hide the wine
And get it gone
I better hide every one of them records that turn me on
(Lock 'em up, lock 'em up)
Turn up the lights
And kill the mood
Because baby I just don't trust myself with you
I better hide the wine
Oh I better hide the wine, yeah
(Knock knock, here you come a-knockin' on my door
Gonna have to wait another minute on the porch)
Oh I better hide the wine
