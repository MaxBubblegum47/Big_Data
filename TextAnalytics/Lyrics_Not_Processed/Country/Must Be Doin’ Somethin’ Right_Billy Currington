[Verse 1]
A woman is mystery
A man just can't understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
And other times you got to take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong

[Chorus]
Must be doing something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doing something right

[Verse 2]
Anywhere you want to go
Baby, show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm, whatever you say
Tonight's about giving you
What you want, whatever it takes
Girl, I hope I'm on the right road
And judging by the smile on your face

[Chorus]
Must be doing something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doing something right

[Bridge]
Ah, Baby
Mmm

[Outro]
I don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doin' something right
Must be doin' something right
