Have you talked to the Man upstairs
Cause He wants to hear from you
Have you talked to the Man upstairs
He will always see you through

And if troubles ever trouble you
Don't you run and hide
Cause if you ever need a friend
He'll be right there by your side

Just turn your eyes to heaven
And just say a simple prayer
Through the clouds, you'll wait to see His face
No matter when or where

Have you talked to the Man upstairs
He wants to hear from you
Have you talked to the Man upstairs
He'll always see you through

And if troubles ever trouble you
Don't you run and hide
Cause if you ever need a friend
He'll be right there by your side

Just turn your eyes to heaven
And say a simple prayer
Through the clouds, you'll wait to see His face
No matter when or where

Have you talked to the Man upstairs
He wants to hear from you
Have you talked to the Man upstairs
He will always see you through
