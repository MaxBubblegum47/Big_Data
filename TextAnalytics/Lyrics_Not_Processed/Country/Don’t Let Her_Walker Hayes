[Verse 1]
She always said if something ever
Happened to me, she would never
Fall in love again, oh, what a waste
We always said we go together
But if I'm just half of her forever
This goes out to whoever takes my place

[Chorus]
She don't give two sips 'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth and your grammar
She loves babies, hates glitter
You better shave 'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please, don't let her

[Verse 2]
She's insecure about her legs, right?
Something wrong with her hair, right?
Just tell her she's crazy (Crazy)
Even though she won't believe you, nah
Best advice I can give you, brother
Don't ever say she's acting just like her mother
Even though she does sometimes (Sometimes)
It's gon' be our little secret

[Chorus]
She don't give two sips 'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth and your grammar
She loves babies (Loves babies), hates glitter
You better shave 'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please, don't let her

[Bridge]
Make her feel better
Say something funny, say something 'bout the weather
Tell her wherever I am, I'm good (I'm good)
And if she's thinking she can love again, she should, understood?
Orchids, that's her favorite flower
Don't ever watch The Office without her
After church (After church), she gon' talk (She gon' talk)
Her favourite season is football

[Chorus]
She don't give two sips 'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth and your grammar
She loves babies, hates glitter
You better shave 'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please, don't let her
