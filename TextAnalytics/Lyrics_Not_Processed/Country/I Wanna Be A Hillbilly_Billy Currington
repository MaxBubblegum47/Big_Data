[Chorus]
I want to be a hillbilly, praying for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I want to be a hillbilly

[Verse 1]
City folks got worries
A country boy's got none
All I want to be is the daddy of a farmer's son
Subdivisions are silly, I want to be a hillbilly

[Chorus]
I want to be a hillbilly, praying for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I want to be a hillbilly

[Verse 2]
When I get finished plowing
I'm going to go to the pond
And take my sweet baby
And have some good clean fun
You got to work, that's a pity
I'm going to be a hillbilly

[Chorus]
I want to be a hillbilly, praying for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I want to be a hillbilly

[Verse 3]
When I die, throw me a big fine wake
And have a party in the barn
Let me lie in state
Plant me under that oak tree
I want to be a hillbilly

[Chorus]
I want to be a hillbilly, praying for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I want to be a hillbilly
