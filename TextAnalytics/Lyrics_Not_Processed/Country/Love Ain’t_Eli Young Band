[Verse 1]
Hotels are made for two night stays, checking in and out
Meeting strangers in the lobby
Waking up and leaving town the next day
But love ain't
And whiskey's poured for when you're bored
And alone on Friday night
When you want to lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain
But love ain't

[Chorus]
Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

[Verse 2]
Sad movies are for crying on the couch there in the dark
That sad song it was written just to try and get your heart to break
But love ain't

[Chorus]
Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

[Bridge]
(Love ain't)
I wonder what he's doing
(Love ain't)
Feeling like a fool
(And you can't)
Keep letting him do it to you

[Chorus]
'Cause love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't
Love ain't (Love ain't), oh yeah (Love ain't)
Love ain't
