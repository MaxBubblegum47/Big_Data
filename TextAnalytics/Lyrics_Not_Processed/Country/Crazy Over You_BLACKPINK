[Verse 1: Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa]
I've been known to kiss and tell
Send girls to wishing wells
If you're my man, I want you to myself
I know I'll have enemies long as you're into me
But I don't care 'cause I got what I need
Oh, yeah, need to get with the program
Boy, I keep you close like slow dance
Hit you with that red, don't go there, no, no man
Met him, then get him, I make sure we stay
Got the venom to dead him if he want a snake
I mean, sneak, I mean, play hide and seek
Know that I'm gonna find you
Make sure you get left 'forе you leave

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé, Jisoo]
I saw you
And knew what I was trying to do
I had to play it rеal, real smooth
And once I finally made my move

[Chorus: Jennie, Lisa, Jisoo]
I went crazy over you (Ah, ah)
Over you, only you (Ah, ah)
I went crazy over you
Like e-e-e-e, e-e-e-e, e-e-e-e

[Verse 2: Jennie, Lisa]
Feels wrong but it's right, right
Blacked out, no night light
Pinked out like fight night
Maxed out of my mind
And the price right
Might buy, might bite
Never the regular degular
Would clean my mess up
But I'd rather mess it up
Simple is so-so, I need that oh no
Don't you know I'm loco?

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo, Rosé]
I saw you
And knew what I was trying to do
I had to play it real, real smooth
And once I finally made my move

[Chorus: Jennie, Lisa, Jisoo]
I went crazy over you (Ah, ah)
Over you, only you (Ah, ah)
I went crazy over you
Like e-e-e-e, e-e-e-e, e-e-e-e

[Bridge: Jennie, Rosé]
Boy, by the time I'm done
I won't be the only one
Acting like you made me
You can't blame me
Swear once you get a taste
You gon' take my place
And you'll love me crazy

[Outro: All, Lisa, Rosé]
Sound the alarms
I'ma be mad 'til you get me back in them arms
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Charge
Give me all you got
Go insane with it, better love hard
Love me like crazy
I love you crazy
