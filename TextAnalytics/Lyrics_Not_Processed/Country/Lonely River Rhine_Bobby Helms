It was spring in Munich on the Rhine
I was lonesome for the love I've left behind
So I stole love happiness my heart could find
From a German girl there on the River Rhine
She thought I was free right from the start
I said love words like an actor plays his part
Till one day I knew I meant then from the heart
I'd found fraulein love there on the River Rhine
In the cold and lonely River Rhine
Lies my little darling my fraulein
When she learned I had a wife
From the bank she took her life
I lost her to the lonely River Rhine
When at last I had to leave her side
It was hard for me to tell her how I'd lied
The morning papers told how she had died
Then was searching for her in the River Rhine
In the cold and lonely River Rhine...
