[Intro: GoldLink]
Pretty woman, pretty girl with pretty thighs
Sorta black woman, had me feelin' like I'm 35
Get a girl, hit her with the phrase, like in my waist
Hit her both ways, as her main nigga and a sidekick

[Verse 1: GoldLink]
I met her in the summer, started with a kiss
And she fucked so good that I had to flood her wrist
Two days in and I wanna have her kid
Then she told me she belong to the city and her boy
Wear a wig and a cig just to smoke away her tears
And I wanna learn about her fears and touch her rear
I think I love her, can't nobody come before her
Ain't no one above her and I wrote this like a sucka singin'

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Touching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Searching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Uh, pretty woman, pretty girl and pretty thighs
Older black woman, had me feeling like I'm 35
Get it girl, hit her with the phrase, still stuck in my ways
Hit her both ways as her main nigga and a sidekick
Lil' rider, fuck me like a side chick
She down like a North Face with some 'posits
Bank credit card scammin' for deposits
And when I do, I do my thing, she never stop me
She love to love me, lovin' me is like a hobby
Lovin' the dough, and my nigga Joe, I told him hit the phone
She never let a nigga get too close
If I die, she'll probably marry me and love my ghost
So I had to work and get the Ghost
Had to work harder so the bitch'll see the Ghost
Oh, my baby ridin' in it and my baby ridin' tinted
And I only fuck with you because it got you in it, get it?

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Touching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Searching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Bridge: GoldLink & Female]
I don't know why I care about you
Care about you
I don't know why I care about you
Care about you
I don't wanna motherfucking care about you
Care about you
I don't wanna motherfucking care about you
Care about you

[Verse 3: GoldLink]
I'ma die but you remember the guy
From sellin' grams the size of GameCube memory card
Yeah yeah, I got a problem with your ex and he know
That if he hit your phone again, I gotta shoot with the 4
'Fore I hit a nigga crazy, leavin' brains on the floor
That's the, "Yeah, keep it movin" like I'm hittin' a hoe
Anyway just know I love you more and more and it shows
And I promise, baby girl, I'll probably never let go

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Touching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Searching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? (Oh-oh-oh)
Where do I find her? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Outro]
I just want you girl
Oh my, oh
Won't you be all mine?
Oh-ooh, babe
'Cause I need you girl
You, you, you, babe
I need you girl
Because I need you more
Yeah
When we go 'round
When we go 'round in circles
Until then
When we go 'round
When we go 'round in circles
Until then
