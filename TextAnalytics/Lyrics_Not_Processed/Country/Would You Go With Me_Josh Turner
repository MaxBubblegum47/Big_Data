[Verse 1]
Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire
Would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher
If we roll from town to town and never shut it down
Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover
Would we walk even closer until the trip was over
And would it be okay if I didn't know the way

[Chorus]
If I gave you my hand
Would you take it and make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Let me know if you're really a dream
I love you so
So would you go with me

[Verse 2]
Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together
Could you not look down forever
If you were lighter than a feather
Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me

[Chorus]
If I gave you my hand
Would you take it and make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Help me tie up the ends of a dream
I gotta know, would you go with me
I love you so, so would you go with me
