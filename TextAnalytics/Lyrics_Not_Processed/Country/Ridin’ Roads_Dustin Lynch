[Intro]
Ridin' roads
Ridin' roads

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah
This town ain't got no nightclub
We don't need the neon lights
Girl, I got that '87 gassed up
Thirty early out there in your drive
Got you a 
Bullet
 and a koozie, keep it ice cold
You take a sip 'fore we get gone
Lookin' at you with your hand out the window
I'm turnin' right while you're turnin' me on, yeah

[Chorus]
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

[Post-Chorus]
Ridin' roads

[Verse 2]
Out there where the moon hits the water
Out there where your lips hit mine
I don't know where we are
'Cause somebody stole the street signs
I'ma take my sweet time, yeah
'Cause I could go on forever
With you there ridin' shotgun, yeah
All our friends are probably makin' plans, baby
Yeah, but we already got one
We'll be

[Chorus]
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

[Post-Chorus]
Just ridin' roads on a night like this
Ridin' roads

[Bridge]
I got one hand on the wheel
And I got the other tryna cross the line, line, line
Yeah, the way you make feel
I wanna keep it rollin' 'til the sunri-ri-rise

[Chorus]
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
The only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Just ridin' roads on a night like this (Oh)
Ridin' roads
