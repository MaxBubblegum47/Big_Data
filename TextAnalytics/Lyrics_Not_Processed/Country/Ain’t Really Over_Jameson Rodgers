[Verse 1]
No we can't just be friends
Every door that I'm closing
You keep cracking open
We've said all we need to say
And started walking different ways
Now we gotta keep going

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't really over
If you're coming over staying all night long
And you can't really hate me
If all you hate is spending time alone, yeah
No it ain't really over
'Til we're over us

[Verse 2]
Girl it's always killing me
To see your low-rise Lucky jeans
Leaving every morning after
You play the part of acting tough
But I can tell it tears you up
So let's just let this unravel

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't really over
If you're coming over staying all night long
And you can't really hate me
If all you hate is spending time alone, yeah
No it ain't really over
'Til we're over us

[Bridge]
This off and on
Drunk phone call
Kinda love just isn't us
Let's hang it up and carry on

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't really over
If you're coming over staying all night long
And you can't really hate me
If all you hate is spending time alone, yeah
No it ain't really over
'Til we're over us
No it ain't really over
Until we're over us
