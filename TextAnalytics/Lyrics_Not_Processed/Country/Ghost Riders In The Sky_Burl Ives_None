An old cowpoke went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed steers he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw
Yipie i-ay yipie i-ay, yipie i-oh yipie i-oh! Ghost riders in the sky
Their brands were still on fire, and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were bright and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard, and he heard their mournful cry
Yipie i-ay yipie i-ay, yipie i-oh yipie i-oh! Ghost riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd, but they ain't caught 'em yet'
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire, as they ride on, hear their cry
Yipie i-ay yipie i-ay, yipie i-oh yipie i-oh! Ghost riders in the sky
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
I-oh
"If you want to save your soul from hell a ridin' on our range
I-ay
Then cowboy change your ways today, or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd, across these endless skies"
Yipie i-ay yipie i-ay, yipie i-oh yipie i-oh! Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
