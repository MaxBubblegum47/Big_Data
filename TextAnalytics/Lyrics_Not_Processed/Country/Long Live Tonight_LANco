[Verse 1]
Put your phone away
I know you want to check it
This is one of those nights
And I don't want to wreck it
With distractions and worries
'Bout what all could go wrong tomorrow
So live in this moment
And know that there's no time to borrow

[Chorus]
It's a crazy, crazy world out there
But baby, baby don't be scared
Cause I got you and you got me
We can set each other free
One day, one day when we're old
We'll look back, look back
And we'll know
We always kept our dreams alive
Loved and laughed until we cried
Ruled the streets until the morning light
Singin' long live tonight
Singin' long live tonight

[Verse 2]
I know an old spot
It ain't that cool
But they got a little dance floor
We can act like fools
We'll ask the DJ to play every song from the 90s
We'll tear it up 'til the sun starts to rise and it's blinding

[Chorus]
It's a crazy, crazy world out there
But baby, baby don't be scared
Cause I got you and you got me
We can set each other free
One day, one day when we're old
We'll look back, look back
And we'll know
We always kept our dreams alive
Loved and laughed until we cried
Ruled the streets until the morning light
Singin' long live tonight
Singin' long live tonight

[Bridge]
Long live, long live
Tonight, tonight
Long live, long live
Tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
It's a crazy, crazy world out there
But baby, baby don't be scared
Cause I got you and you got me
We can set each other free
One day, one day when we're old
We'll look back, look back
And we'll know
We always kept our dreams alive
Loved and laughed until we cried
Ruled the streets until the morning light
Singin' long live tonight
Singin' long live tonight
