You said you want to love my baby
But now you changed your mind
You said you're gonna be true babe
Until the end of time
Then you started messin' round with me baby
Tryin' to do lovin' daddy no good
Since you've been bad with my lovin' baby
I don't think I'm gonna move into your neighbourhood
Eh, I don't need no grocery boy
I'm gonna fetch them ev'ry day
I don't want no grocery boy
You gotta keep that boy, keep that boy away
I've been sittin' here thinkin'
About that baby, baby, on my mind
Well, I've been lovin' you baby
But, oh baby, always treat me unkind
I'll buy you fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring
No matter how you treat me baby
I can hear my lonely heart sing
Yeah. I been sittin' here thinkin' baby
I've been missin' her, thinkin' about
That baby on my mind
I've gotta leave you baby
Babe, woman you been, uah-ha-ha, aha-ha-ha
She's been sittin' here thinkin'
About that baby, on my mind
Whoa-whoa-whoa
