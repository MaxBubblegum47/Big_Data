[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I come from a city
When 9/11 dialed up, everybody riled up hundred gun pile up
They lay it on the line, make sure you don't get file up
Hammer in and out of court, nigga don't get trialled up
I'm chasing cheese, dodging rat traps
Chasing pussy, you might end up with a Kat Stacks
I'm outtie like a hatchback
For them whole and half stacks
Trying to make at least half back, nigga af-tax
D-town I honor ya, they hearts drop when they see me on tall monitors
Blasting my city that's your ass in my city
Need a pass in my city
And I'm mr. hall monitor in my

[Outro]
The city the city I like it in the city
