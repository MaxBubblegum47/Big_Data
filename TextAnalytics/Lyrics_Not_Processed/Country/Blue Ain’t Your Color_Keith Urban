[Verse 1]
I can...
See you over there starin' at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink, all alone tonight
And...
Chances are you're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's...
Probably not my place but I'm gonna say it anyway
‘Cause you look like
You...
Haven’t felt the fire, had a little fun
Hadn’t had a smile in a little while, baby

[Chorus]
Blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color

[Verse 2]
I'm not tryna...
Be another just pick you up kinda guy
Tryna drink you up, tryna take you home
But I just...
I don't understand how another man
Can take your sun and turn it ice cold
Well, I've...
Had enough to drink and it's makin' me think
That I just might
Tell you...
If I were a painter I wouldn’t change ya
I’d just paint you bright, baby

[Chorus]
'Cause blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color

[Bridge]
No, no, no
Mmmm
It ain't your color baby
Mmm, baby

[Chorus]
Blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color
Blue ain’t your color

[Outro]
Mmm, no, no, no baby
Come here, baby
Let me light up your world
