[Verse 1: Chris Young]
I feel terrible, sunlight's hurting my eyes
So I pull the shades and I make my place as black as night
I feel miserable, and I'm missing you and me
'Nother Sunday morning all alone underneath these sheets

[Chorus: Chris Young and Vince Gill]
No I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you
All messed up, all strung out
I was sitting at home, breaking down
Not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night

[Verse 2: Chris Young]
Besides the pain, I don't feel a thing
When my buddies call me up, I just let it ring

[Chorus: Chris Young and Vince Gill]
No I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you
All messed up, all strung out
I was sitting at home, breaking down
Not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night

[Outro: Chris Young and Vince Gill]
No I'm not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night
