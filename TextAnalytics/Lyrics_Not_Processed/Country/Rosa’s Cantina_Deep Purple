[Verse 1]
Going to Rosa's Cantina [2x]
Hoping that she's still there
Going to Rosa's Cantina
Might have been
The dust in my eyes [2x]
Could have been the neon cactus
Lighting up the desert sky
Must have been
The dust in my eyes

[Chorus]
Some would call it suicide [2x]
I would call it paradise
Some would call it suicide

[Bridge]
Dancing on the table [3x]
When she's
Drunker than she's able
Dancing on the table

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Is she right is she wrong
Will she sing another song
Wicked as it seems
Right now
Rosa wants her baby back [2x]
Since he's gone she's losing track
Rosa wants her baby back
Careful with that cadillac [3x]
