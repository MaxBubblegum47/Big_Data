[Verse 1]
23 degrees and south
Ride the river down to the mouth
This crazy life I can do without
Long as you're here with me
Catch a wave and ride the crest
Hang ten and hook it to the west
Sell it all til' there's nothing left
Long as you're here with me

[Chorus]
Going to play this old guitar
For beer and tips at a beach side bar
Little out of key, we'll sing it loud
Don't need a map to get us where we're going
Sail wherever the breeze is blowing
Rediscover what our love is all about
You and me and 23 degrees south

[Verse 2]
Remember me, remember you
All those crazy things we said we'd do
We got so lost and out of the blue
Dreams just slip away
But I'm still here and you're my girl
Still you and me against the world
Pack a bag and pack it light
Come on baby, we can leave tonight

[Chorus]
Going to play this old guitar
For beer and tips at a beach side bar
Little out of key, we'll sing it loud
Don't need a map to get us where we're going
Sail wherever the breeze is blowing
Rediscover what our love is all about
You and me and 23 degrees south

[Outro]
Play songs on this guitar
We'll get back to who we are
Fall like shooting stars that don't burn out
Don't need a map to get us where we're going
Sail wherever the breeze is blowing
Remember what our love is all about
You and me and 23 degrees south, mmm, hmm
Well, come on baby, pack it light, mmm, hmm
23 degrees south, oh yeah
