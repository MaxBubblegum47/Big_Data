[Verse 1]
I had a couple beers with one of my friends
​Told him just how our story ends
​Did all I could to try to make it work
​But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt

[Verse 2]
​I've been at the house, climbin' them walls
​Checkin' that calendar, x'in days off
​Hit another bar, call another friend
​Throw a few down, tell the story again
​

[Chorus]
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
​I can just lie and say it's all okay
​Oh, oh, what can I do?
​Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
​But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​

[Verse 3]
I'm finally gettin' out back into the world
​Life is good, I met me a girl
​She got a beautiful heart, eyes are blue
​I don't hardly ever think about you
​

[Chorus]
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to

[Bridge]
​Sometimes I find peace of mind in a bottle of wine
​Sometimes I break down and cry
​

[Chorus]
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
​Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay
Oh, oh, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
​No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
It don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to
