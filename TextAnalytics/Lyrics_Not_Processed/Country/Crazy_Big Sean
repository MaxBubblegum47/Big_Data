[Intro]
Yeah
Finally Famous in this... getting money (money)
G.O.O.D Music, ay!

[Hook]
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
That she was crazy than a muh-fucker (Crazy, crazy, crazy)
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
She was crazy than a muh-fucker (crazy, cray, crazy) (man fuck her, crazy ass)

[Verse 1]
(I do it)
And God damn you all crazy ass (what?)
Wanna smash my Mercedes ass (what?)
Pokin' holes off in the condoms tryna have a baby ass (what?)
All up in Saks Fifth when you deserve Macy's ass (*scoffs*)
Talkin' bout "Shit, yeah nigga, better pay me" ass (bitch)
All up in my house and I ain't tryna room-mate her (mate her)
She in and out my drawers like it's, like it's Room Raiders (raider)
She crazy and deranged (yeah), when she in the Range (*car screech sound*)
Skip the jewelry store and grab rocks
Like she Tomb Raider (raider)
But before you hit that Alter and the preacher start pronouncin' (uh-huh)
Gave her half your heart but she got half of your amount (oh yeah)
Of whatever's in your account
So take that into account
And you best get to count-in'
Before you gets to bounc-in'
Bitch

[Hook]
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muh-fucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
That she was crazy than a muh-fucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muh-fucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
She was crazy than a muh-fucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
(I do it)

[Verse 2]
This. Bitch. Crazy
Man I must be crazy too
Cuz crazy as she is I couldn't leave her if you paid me to
I swear I goes to work on that pussy like she paid me to
D-d-dick her up and now she walkin' like she 82
(I like the you you do it)
She get it from her mama
Headaches every night a nigga get it from the drama
Man if she don't make that money, she gon' take that money
Not from you?
Then she'll get it from Your Honor (your honor?)
Believe that, fuck you get my password?
Readin' through my emails and you ain't even ask first
I know I should leave her
For damn sure don't, don't need her
Every time I try and hit the door I always hit that ass first

[Hook]
(Man I should've known)
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muh-fucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
She was crazy than a muh-fucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
Should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muh-fucker

She was crazy than a muh-fucker
