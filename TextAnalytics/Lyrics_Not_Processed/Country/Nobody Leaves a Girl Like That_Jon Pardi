[Verse 1]
She's got the kind of eyes you wanna get lost in
You're gonna look twice when she gets to walkin'
In a honky tonk with them blue jeans on
She's a cold beer, a whiskey shot, a neon light
A Strait song on the jukebox, a dance all night
What a cowboy wants, a never-do-you-wrong

[Chorus]
Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves a girl like that

[Verse 2]
I was reckless and wild, didn't think I was ready
Couldn't settle me down, so I fired up my Chevy
I was stubborn and she was cryin'
Well, she knew she couldn't stop me, but she kept right on tryin'

[Chorus]
Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves a girl like that

[Bridge]
She's the kind of girl that only comes around once
Well, she found somebody new and I'm goin' crazy because

[Chorus]
Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves
Nobody leaves a girl like that, ah nah
A girl like that
