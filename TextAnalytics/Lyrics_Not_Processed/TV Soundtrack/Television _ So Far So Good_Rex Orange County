[Part I: Television]

[Verse 1]
Hey, I’m not afraid, I can be myself and I
Hope you can be yourself as well, ‘cause I can make you feel alright
And there was so much happiness that we were still yet to find
I said that you can call me Alex, baby, welcome to my life

[Bridge]
But don’t you worry, don’t you, don’t worry girl
No, I’m not sure if I’m into you
The last time that you checked, I was probably so sad and confused
I don’t know, no, I don’t know what you like
But if you’re looking for something new
I know somebody that you could choose

[Chorus]
What about me?
What about me?
What about me and you together?
Something that could really last forever
What about me?
What about me?
What about me and you together?
Something that could really last forever

[Verse 2]
If all my friends wanna be in her bed
And I begin to wonder why
I guess that I’d be lying to myself
‘Cause who the fuck would be dumb enough
To reject an offer? Oh, what an offer
Now two-two-ten-one-five
Couple hours can change your life
Frankie saying "Oh, what a night!"
What a night?
What the fuck is a girlfriend? I'ma need advice
Maybe I should go outside so I could get a fucking life
I made a friend and she spent the night, and now

[Bridge]
I’m in love and she remains in my life
I’m back and we spoke in Europe
I need insurance on my emotions
I can’t get hurt again
Fuck the past, fuck them, they all made me sad
And I had no time to prepare to face my fears
I guess that it’s time that I dried these tears

[Outro]
But if I could just be happy by the end of this song
But if by the time you hear it, you are already gone
And it didn’t go to plan
Then why should I continue in this life
When there’s no one around to be the one who makes me smile?

[Part II: So Far So Good]

[Verse]
But so far, everything’s good (Ooh)
Oh, oh, oh
So far, everything’s good (Ooh)
Oh, oh, oh
(Ooh)
No, no, no
No, no, no, no, no-oh, oh
I want the crowd in tears when they hear this
Is that so wrong?
