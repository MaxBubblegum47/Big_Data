[Intro]
It's good to be home!
I see the light in the sky, this shit is official

[Verse 1]
I got a lot on my mind, I got more in my face
If I ain't going to get it that day is going to waste
I'm tryna move in my safe like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat but these hoes stay on the stakeout
And you know it's official when I go bringing that BAPE out
I'm thumbing through the magazines like "This the girl Imma take out"
Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way-way out
And yeah, your music been bumping and you just waiting to break out
And I've been waiting all god damn year, oh yeah
I can tell that it's near but near ain't here
Man, them bills is here right now
I guess you shine brightest when the lights down like now
And then they say it happened for me overnight, shit yeah I guess
I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success
What you know 'bout living check to check to living check to check to check to check?
First place, no neck and neck
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast
Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air
Yes, and I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese
Taking double shots like Siamese
I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like "Sign these"
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees
I should've known back then I wasn't gon' stop
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top
I said, "I should've known back then, man, that I wasn't gon' stop"
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top

[Hook]
And I only thank Allah for his favors
I started from hell and made it to heaven
I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on
I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on
Said, "And I only thank Allah for his favors
I started from hell and made it to heaven
I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on
I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on

[Verse 2]
Bitch, watch how you speak to me
I've been working all week and I know I need ZZZZs
Tryna get paid repeatedly
Jamaica or Cancun, now that's where I need to be
Credit card used to be EBT, in the D though that's D-EBT
I've been thinking about becoming a cop
So I can murk some niggas one by one off legally
I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it
One time for the city, treating it like it's the mothership
Was talking to my dad though on some other shit
He like "man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with
If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it
Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother"
But that's on some other shit, look
I'm into risk and taking it
I'm into making it then get back to making like I ain't made it yet
This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it
I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit
But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work
Even if you don't get paid for it
Shit, Allah is the greatest
Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour
Like thank you Allah, look at all you created
I started rapping like 2Pac when I was seven
And now I can't wait to meet him in heaven
