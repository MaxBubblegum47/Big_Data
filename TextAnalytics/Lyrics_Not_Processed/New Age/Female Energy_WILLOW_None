[Verse 1]
I just landed in another atmosphere
I'm just floating, in a stain steel sphere
I bet you have questions like, "Where did I come from?"
I know,I come from that planet that hit Tiamat
Years ago
Years ago
Years ago
Years ago
I do my flows and then I get so lost
Light just take my sphere to go
Sphere to go
Sphere to go
Sphere to go
To the top of the pyramid, let's save the world like this
Conversing with light bodies
But really they all a part of me
Let's get the whip and go
'Cause I'm tired of this solar ring

[Chorus]
It's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I do not want you to go, but I don't know how to stop you

[Verse 2]
Whatever, whatever I guess whatever
I don't care, get dressed whatever
I don't feel like talking, whatever

[Hook]
Cause it's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I really don't want you to go, but I do not want to stop you

[Verse 3]
'Cause you gon' do what you got to do
And what I do is not your problem
Just let me, let me love you
Stop trying to make it complicated

[Outro]
Really out of my control
What I do is not your problem
I really want to go
But please, please don't stop me
