[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Batman, Batman, Batman
Joker just put me on acid
Huh, you on the wave like a Maverick
You need to make something happen
Batman, Batman, Batman
Please put me on new fashion
Huh, I ain't learn nothing since last year
You got the renegade fabrics
Batman, Batman, Batman
Please put me up on a Tesla (Skrrt!)
I'm tryna be hella extra
Please hand-me-down a new sweatshirt
Batman, Batman, Batman
Heard that you ain't got a mattress
Heard that you king of Manhattan (Queens)
So why you stay in the 'Basas?
Batman, Batman, Batman
We need to settle the scores
Jokers they still want a war
Watch out, I'm closing the doors
Batman, Batman, Batman
I heard you married a Porsche
That shit is all in the past, plus we got very divorced
You ain't ready for the war, Skywalker with the force
One, two, three, four, D'artiste is making noise
In the suburbs with the boys, on a roll, no Royce
Had to save the day every single way, we don't really got a choice
Batman, Batman, Batman
Please save the day from the demons
I was sleep and he was leaning
We drove right into a precinct

[Chorus]
Batman, Batman, Batman
Why you look flyer than hell?
Don't think the album will sell
But this shit might fly off the shelf
Batman, Batman, Batman
So fly that you mad at yourself
You the one who got the juice, city crying for your help

[Pre-Chorus]
Shooting up on Skid Row, out your window
Look and you could tell
Get it from under their spell
If I don't do it, then who else?
Need me to shoot up the signal
I'll be there to get the info
Skrrtin' through the residential (Skrrt!)
I wish it wasn't plain and simple
Lemme pull up to the party, need like 35 credentials

[Chorus]
Batman, Batman, Batman
Why you look flyer than hell?
Don't think the album will sell
But this shit might fly off the shelf
Batman, Batman, Batman
We need to settle the scores
Jokers they still want a war
Hold up, I'm closing the doors
Batman, Batman, Batman
So fly that you mad at yourself
You the one who got the juice, city crying for your help

[Outro]
Batman, Batman, Batman
That was not part of the deal
You was protecting the bank and then you walked off with a mil'
