[Intro: Big Sean]
Ah-huh
Ah-huh
Whoa
These ho's be doin' research
I swear, she like:
"This piece of hair off in the sink ain't come from me first, no, no"

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
The way you stressin' got me blowin' indo outdoor
Every time you intro that's my cue to outro
And I know all my niggas call you crazy, you just misunderstood, though
Through all the evil in your eyes swear I can still see the good, though
But you unlockin' my cell like you is a cop, how you decode
All my V-mails, G-mails even P.O. boxes got me P.O.’d
You saw my emails with CeCe when you wasn't CC'd
I'm on my way to halfway, my baby, I need you to meet me
 (straight up)
You, you talkin' 'bout I had the key to your heart
Then I got my first European, you took that key then you keyed it
What type of shit do we be in? Blowin' up TNT'n'
Hella drama, TMZ'n
, 
bitch, I'm leavin' then she switched the shit like

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande (Big Sean)]
What you got to hide, hide, hide, hide? (uh-huh)
Lying next to me at night, night, night, night (uh-huh)
You text me all the time, time, time, time (whoa)
See, I know what you like, like I did the last time (whoa)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
When you had nothing to hide, hide, hide, hide?

[Post-Chorus: Big Sean]
Watch out, these ho's be doin' research
I swear, she like:
"This piece of hair off in the sink ain't come from me first, no, no"
I swear (God)
You hang around too goddamn long, it's like you need work
Do ya, do ya, do ya got a job, I mean, for real
I swear (oh God)
Man, these ho's be doin' research, doin' research
Watch out, these girls be
 doin' research

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, I know you did some research
Well shit, I did too
I saw you wearin' Drake's chain, like you were part of his crew
I saw you chillin' with Meek Mill up at the Summer Jam, ooo
I hope my eyes the one that’s lyin' to me girl and not you
I know we all got a past, but there's shit that I can't pass
Seein' you at the Soho House, I know you can't afford that tab
When I run into Chris Brown and he laugh, 'cause he know
What you know
, 
what I don't, it make me feel like I don't know your ass
Now you saying shit like

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande (Big Sean)]
What you got to hide, hide, hide, hide? (uh-huh)
Lying next to me at night, night, night, night (uh-huh)
You text me all the time, time, time, time (whoa)
See, I know what you like, like I did the last time (whoa)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
When you had nothing to hide, hide, hide, hide?

[Post-Chorus: Big Sean]
Watch out, these ho's be doin' research
I swear, she like:
"This piece of hair off in the sink ain't come from me first, no, no"
I swear
You hang around too goddamn long, it's like you need work
Do ya, do ya, do ya got a job, I mean, for real
I swear
Man, these ho's be doin' research, doin' research
Watch out, these girls be
 doin' research
