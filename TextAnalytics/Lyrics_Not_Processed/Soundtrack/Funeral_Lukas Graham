[Verse 1]
When it's my time, I know you'll tailor a new suit for me
And buy a new tie, so I'll look this good
Boy, you were right
You said only the good ones die young
Never in my life did I look this good

[Chorus]
Everyone welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
'Cause the way I lived, it was amazing
Ooh ooh ooh
All of my friends are in the room
Ooh ooh ooh
Party for me, I'd party too

[Verse 2]
You're all on my tab
Bartenders pour out the whiskeys on me
And don't be so sad
'Cause I lived this good
We were closer
Now it's over
But it doesn't mean it's closure
I see you and I love you
I'll be watching out above you

[Chorus]
Everyone welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
'Cause the way I lived, it was amazing
Ooh ooh ooh
All of my friends are in the room
Ooh ooh ooh
Party for me, I'd party too
Ooh ooh ooh
All of my friends are in the room
Ooh ooh ooh
Party for me, I'd party too
Everyone welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
'Cause the way I lived, it was amazing
Welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
'Cause the way I lived, it was amazing
Welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
'Cause the way I lived, it was amazing
So welcome to my funeral
Welcome to my funeral
