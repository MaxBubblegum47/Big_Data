[Verse 1]
Well hey
Little Miss Stop-N-Go
Cruising 'round town
With your speakers blown
Listening to the radio
Saying who that right there
Playing in my earlobe

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, that's my song
All the way
Let me see you
Shake that ass and sing
Everybody 'bout to
Know my name
My name

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be the
Song that's playing
When you get that first tattoo
The song that's playing
When you in the backseat
With you know who
The song that's playing
Someday when you look back
I was gonna be the jam
Your favorite band
Right here, hey
Is gonna be your soundtrack
Gonna be your soundtrack

[Verse 2]
You'll be grooving to the rhythm
Singing every word
And while you're dashboard drumming
Baby please don't swerve
If you got some time
I gotta some rhymes
Sweeter than sweet iced tea
Sweeter than apple pie

[Pre-Chorus]
Well that's my song, all the way
Just let me see you
Shake that, and say
Everybody 'bout to know my name
My name

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be the
Song that's playing
When you get that first tattoo
The song that's playing
When you in the backseat
With you know who
The song that's playing
Someday when you look back
I was gonna be the jam
Your favorite band
Right here, hey
Is gonna be your soundtrack
Gonna be your soundtrack, baby

[Bridge]
That's right girl
Yeah, one more time
Ba ba ba ba ba da
Ba ba ba ba ba da
Ba da da
Ba da da

[Verse 3]
When you graduate from school
When you breaking your mama's rules
When you skinny dipping in the lake
On a Tuesday
It's gonna be your soundtrack
When you try your first sip of Jack
When you catch your first big old Bass
When you peelin' in mud
Smoking on bud, falling in love
It's gonna be

[Chorus]
The song that's playing
When you get that first tattoo
The song that's playing
When you in the backseat
With you know who
The song that's playing
Someday when you look back
I was gonna be the jam
Your favorite band
Right here, hey
Is gonna be your soundtrack
Alright
Gonna be your soundtrack
Hey, gonna be your soundtrack baby
Gonna be your soundtrack
Woo, it's gonna be your soundtrack
