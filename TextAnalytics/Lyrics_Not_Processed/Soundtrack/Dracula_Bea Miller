[Verse 1]
Here is my story, I got my type
Tattoos and skinny jeans
Black boots and piercings
A public enemy
Not Cinderella, still got my shoes
I like the animal, the supernatural
Maybe I'm crazy but

[Chorus]
If you were Dracula
I'd be letting you take that bite
Hot and hazardous
Like playing with dynamite
Yeah I want Dracula
Forever be young and wild
Dark and Dangerous
Yeah I love, I love the tragically beautiful

[Verse 2]
I am a night owl, I come alive
I'll make the sun go down
So I can see you out
Straight to the underground
I like the broken, imperfect rules
That's why you're wonderful
It's undeniable
I might be crazy but

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Only one kiss, only one
Only one kiss
You'll be k-k-k-k-killing me
Only one kiss, only one
Only one kiss
You'll be k-k-k-k-killing me

[Chorus]
