[GLINDA]
Dearest, darlingest Momsie and Popsicle...

[ELPHABA]
My dear father...

[BOTH]
There's been some confusion over rooming here at Shiz

[ELPHABA]
But of course, I'll care for Nessa

[GLINDA]
But of course, I'll rise above it

[BOTH]
For I know that's how you'd want me to respond, yes
There's been some confusion for you see my roommate is...

[GLINDA]
Unusually and exceedingly peculiar
And altogether quite impossible to describe...

[ELPHABA]
Blonde

[GLINDA]
What is this feeling, so sudden, and new?

[ELPHABA]
I felt the moment I laid eyes on you

[GLINDA]
My pulse is rushing

[ELPHABA]
My head is reeling

[GLINDA]
My face is flushing

[BOTH]
What is this feeling?
Fervid as a flame, does it have a name?
Yes. Loathing!
Unadulterated loathing!

[GLINDA]
For your face

[ELPHABA]
Your voice

[GLINDA]
Your clothing!

[BOTH]
Let's just sayâ€”I loathe it all!
Every little trait however small
Makes my very flesh begin to crawl
With simple utter loathing!
There's a strange exhilaration

In such total detestation
It's so pure, so strong!
Though I do admit, it came on fast
Still I do believe that it can last
And I will be loathing, loathing you my whole life long

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
Dear Glinda, you are just too good!
How do you stand it, I don't think I could
She's a terror
She's a Tartar
We don't mean to show a bias but Glinda, you're a martyr!

[GLINDA]
Well, these things are sent to try us...

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
Poor Glinda, forced to reside
With someone so disgusticified
We just want to tell you, we're all on your side!
We share your...

[GLINDA & ELPHABA, SHIZ STUDENTS, ALL]
What is this feeling so sudden and new?
Loathing, unadulterated loathing
I felt the moment I laid eyes on you
For her face, her voice, her clothing
My pulse is rushing, my head is reeling
Let's just say we loathe it all
Oh, what is this feeling?
Every little trait, however small
Does it have a name? Yes
Makes our very flesh begin to crawl
Ahhh
Loathing (Loathing)
There's a strange exhilaration (Loathing)
In such total detestation (Loathing)
It's so pure, so strong (So strong)

[BOTH]
Though I do admit, it came on fast
Still I do believe that it can last!

[GLINDA & ELPHABA, SHIZ STUDENTS]
And I will be loathing (Loathing)
For forever, loathing (Loathing)
Truly deeply, loathing you (Loathing, loathing you)
My whole life long (Loathing, unadulterated loathing)

[ELPHABA]
BOO!

[GLINDA]
Ahhh!
