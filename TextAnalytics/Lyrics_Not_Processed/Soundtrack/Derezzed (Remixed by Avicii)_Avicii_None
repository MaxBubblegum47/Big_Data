Don't wanna let you go
I'm staying in here by your side
Wished I was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Won't let it pass me by
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing

If we could spend forever
Be apart never
That's alright, with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing

Don't wanna let you go
I'm staying here by your side
Wished I was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Won't let it pass me by
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing

If we could spend forever
Be apart never
That's alright, with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing
