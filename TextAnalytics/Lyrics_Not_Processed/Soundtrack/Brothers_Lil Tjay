[Chorus]
Bodies drop all the time, I don't feel nothing
Swear to God y'all gon' make me go kill something
Told my shooters no mercy or chill button
I done been through so much, I don't feel nothing
I was down off the drugs, I'm exuded
I was locked in my cell 'bout to lose it
They be watching me, clocking my movements
They be plotting on catching me snoozing
Bodies drop all the time, I don't feel nothing
Swear to God y'all gon' make me go kill something
Told my shooters no mercy or chill button
I done been through so much, I don't feel nothing
I was down off the drugs, I'm exuded
I was locked in my cell 'bout to lose it
They be watching me, clocking my movements
They be plotting on catching me snoozing

[Verse 1]
I be shitting, I make it look easy
I was innocent, they ain't believe me
Ain't no lie, I be seeing illusions
I can't figure who real, it's confusing
I can't wait to get used to this lifestyle
I remember it could've been lights out
Bitches see me and scream Lil Tjay
Had to fuck up the spot for my B-day
Hit the 'telly and catch me a BJ
Fuck this love, I don't want me a skeezay
Give her dick, now she feel like she need me
I'm too high, always smoking on GG
Bankroll, had to stack my chips
SB, I'ma jack my shit
I know these niggas gon' hate me
I've been working hard, driving me crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Big bag don't mean everything wavy
I got 99 problems like JAY-Z
Caught a felony, judge tried to slave me
Lost my grandmother, R.I.P. Mavy
I got money and niggas moved shady
With my brother, I put that on baby
My first car, I might cop a Mercedes
At the stu' every day, can't be lazy

[Chorus]
Bodies drop all the time, I don't feel nothing
Swear to God y'all gon' make me go kill something
Told my shooters no mercy or chill button
I done been through so much, I don't feel nothing
I was down off the drugs, I'm exuded
I was locked in my cell 'bout to lose it
They be watching me, clocking my movements
They be plotting on catching me snoozing
Bodies drop all the time, I don't feel nothing
Swear to God y'all gon' make me go kill something
Told my shooters no mercy or chill button
I done been through so much, I don't feel nothing
I was down off the drugs, I'm exuded
I was locked in my cell 'bout to lose it
They be watching me, clocking my movements
They be plotting on catching me snoozing

[Verse 2]
Dream big, I'ma get to the top
Niggas waiting, the tape 'bout to drop
Told my mother that I'm destined to pop
Y'all ain't think I would get what I got
But I stayed true to myself
No losing myself
Improving myself
I'm on the road to the riches
I'm asking the Lord for forgiveness
I got two or three opps on the hit list
Y'all be talking but ain't never did shit
You'd be better off minding your business
Hard-headed, I just don't like to listen
Mezclando, I stay in the kitchen
Money coming in, my palms is itching
Y'all niggas ain't no competition

[Pre-Chorus]
Big bag don't mean everything wavy
I got 99 problems like JAY-Z
Caught a felony, judge tried to slave me
Lost my grandmother, R.I.P. Mavy
I got money and niggas moved shady
With my brother, I put that on baby
My first car, I might cop a Mercedes
At the stu' every day, can't be lazy

[Chorus]
Bodies drop all the time, I don't feel nothing
Swear to God y'all gon' make me go kill something
Told my shooters no mercy or chill button
I done been through so much, I don't feel nothing
I was down off the drugs, I'm exuded
I was locked in my cell 'bout to lose it
They be watching me, clocking my movements
They be plotting on catching me snoozing
Bodies drop all the time, I don't feel nothing
Swear to God y'all gon' make me go kill something
Told my shooters no mercy or chill button
I done been through so much, I don't feel nothing
I was down off the drugs, I'm exuded
I was locked in my cell 'bout to lose it
They be watching me, clocking my movements
They be plotting on catching me snoozing
