[Verse 1: Kristoff]
Again, you're gone
Off on a different path than mine
I'm left behind
Wondering if I should follow
You had to go
And, of course, it's always fine
I probably could catch up with you tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus: Kristoff]
But is this what it feels like
To be growing apart?
When did I become the one
Who's always chasing your heart?

[Chorus 1: Kristoff]
Now I turn around and find
I am lost in the woods
North is south, right is left
When you're gone
I'm the one who sees you home
But now I'm lost in the woods
And I don't know what path you are on
I'm lost in the woods

[Verse 2: Kristoff]
Up 'til now
The next step was a question of how
I never thought it was a question of whether
Who am I, if I'm not your guy?
Where am I, if we're not together
Forever?

[Chorus 2: Kristoff]
Now I know you're my true north
'Cause I am lost in the woods
Up is down, day is night
When you're not there
Oh, you're my only landmark
So I'm lost in the woods
Wondering if you still care

[Bridge: Kristoff & 
Reindeer
]
But I'll wait
For a sign (
For a sign
)
That I'm your path
'Cause you are mine (
You are mine
)
'Til then
I'm lost in the woods

[Outro: Kristoff & 
Reindeer
]
Lost in the woods
 (
Lost, lost
)
In the woods, in the woods
 (
Lost in the woods
)
I'm lost in the woods
Lost in the woods
 (
Lost, lost
)
(
Lost
)
I'm lost in the woods
