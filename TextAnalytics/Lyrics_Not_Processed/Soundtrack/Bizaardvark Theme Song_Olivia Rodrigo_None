[Intro]
You can spend all day on a swing eating a Baguette
But why doing boring things like that when there's the internet?

[Chorus]
Let's Go Make Some Videos!
(Hey! Hey!)
Let's Go Make Some Videos!
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
You could watch Dirk doing crazy dares saying "Here We Go"

[Dirk (Jake Paul)]
(Here We Go!)

[Verse 1 Continued]
He'll do anything you want
Just don't try this at home

[Verse 2]
Or watch Amelia
Teachin' Ya
How to look your best
Making over people is her never-ending quest

[Verse 3]
You could watch

[Dirk (Jake Paul)]
Do you have constant Foot Oder?

[Verse 3 Continued]
You could watch us make ridiculously funny videos!
Like the one with evil pop-up book that punches you in your nose

[Chorus]
Let's Go Make Some Videos!
(Hey! Hey!)
Let's Go Make Some Videos!

[Bernie Schotz (Ethan Wacker)]
And I'm
Aw, I missed it!
