[Verse]
I'm tired of being down on my knees
With the weight and the world coming down on me
She says there's always someone better waiting for her
That I was so lucky to get her

[Pre Chorus]
Even though I, I wanna cry
I wonder why all of my tears are dry
I just don't dare to show I care
I got nothing left to spare

[Chorus]
I wonder why I try
I wonder why
When nothing pleases a woman
There's just no pleasing a woman

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
I'm tired of being down on my knees
With the weight and the world coming down on me
She says there's always someone better waiting for her
That I was so lucky to get her

[Pre Chorus]
Even though I, I wanna cry
I wonder why all of my tears are dry
I just don't dare to show I care
I got nothing left to spare

[Chorus]
I wonder why I try
I wonder why
When nothing pleases a woman
There's just no pleasing a woman
