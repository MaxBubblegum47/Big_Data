[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
But who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
And I got a bonus but I ain't seen it yet
I've got streaming money, I ain't seen it yet
I got a bitch that love me, I ain't seen her yet
I got a bitch that love me, I don't seem depressed
I can't adjust, I can't adjust, I can't adjust, I can't adjust
Takes confidence, the confidence to conquer
These motherfucker shake hands with these fuckers, traitors
Thank confidence, the confidence to conquer, conquer
I don't shake hands with no motherfuckin' cowards

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I been smokin' nigga, fuck my drug test
Block get hotter, need a bulletproof vest
I been runnin' since I hit my first lick
Seen that chopper turn that dog to a bitch
The money is dirty, these niggas launderin' it
Stashin' the weed, we run from the lawmen again
And the sheriff is comin', he think he caught me again
But the barrel is barkin', he ain't walkin' again
And I ain't playin', I'm in the game like E and A
And runnin' thangs is in my veins and DNA
My flow is colder than eskimos and Himalayans
I speak in tongues but niggas know just what I'm sayin'
I'm thinkin' different like protozoas and atom splittin'
But niggas shootin' and runnin' out of they ammunition
I keep it movin' and only ride if my niggas with me
And we ain't scared, my niggas swang and hang with me

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
One body, two body, pressed in a room with nobody, body
Grab yo' engine like Bugatti, seen bubbles in Bali, Bali

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I was gettin' bald touchin' sands in the moonlight
You was gettin' old, each summer could move right
Lips slide to cheek, last time that I seen ya'
Rugged buck eye walkin' down by the beaches
Hardly acknowledge the fact that I love you
Practice voodoo on me, I can feel when you want it
In another dimension, you're a blip in the matrix
A hat trick, never seen a real life, realize I fantasize
Hips sway under each breath, realize I fantasize
Hips sway under each breath, realize I fantasize
