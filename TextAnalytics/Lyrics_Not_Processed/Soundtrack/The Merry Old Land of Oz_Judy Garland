[EMERALD CITY PEOPLE]
Ha ha ha
Ho ho ho
And a couple of tra-la-la's
That's how we laugh the day away
In the Merry Old Land of Oz!

Buzz, buzz, buzz
Chirp, chirp, chirp
And a couple of la-di-da's
That's how the crickets crick all day
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

We get up at twelve and start to work at one
Take an hour for lunch and then at two we're done

Jolly good fun!

Ha ha ha
Ho ho ho
And a couple of tra-la-la's
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

Ha ha ha
Ho ho ho
Ha ha ha ha ha
That's how we laugh the day away
With a ho ho ho ha ha ha
In the merry old land of Oz

Pat pat here
Pat pat there
And a couple of brand new straws
That's how we keep you young and fair
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

Rub rub here
Rub rub there
Whether you're tin or brass
That's how we keep you in repair
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

[MANICURIST]
We can make a dimple smile out of a frown

[DOROTHY]
Can you even dye my eyes to match my gown?

[MANICURIST]
Uh-huh!

[DOROTHY]
Jolly old town!

Clip-clip here
Clip-clip there
We give the roughest claws
That certain air of savoir faire
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

Ha ha ha
Ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho
That's how we laugh the day away
In the Merry Old Land of Oz
That's how we laugh the day away
With a ha ha ha, ha ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha, ha ha ha
In the Merry Old Land of Oz
Ha ha ha, ho ho oh, ha ha ha
Ah ha ha
