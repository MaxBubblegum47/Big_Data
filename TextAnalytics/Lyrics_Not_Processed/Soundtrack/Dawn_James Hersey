[Verse 1]
Don't go running out
Don't go race around this town tonight
Stay here, everything will fall in place
As long as we don't try to chase

[Chorus]
Can we take this path?
Will you follow through?
Will you walk beside me?
Realize there's something new every dawn
With a single breath, we'll walk this street
We'll [?] realize there's something real
Not just make-believe

[Verse 3]
Don't go running out
Don't go running out
Don't go race around this town tonight
Stay here, everything will fall in place
As long as we don't try to chase

[Chorus]
Can we take this path?
Will you follow through?
Will you walk beside me?
Realize there's something new every dawn
With a single breath, we'll walk this street
We'll [?] realize there's something real
Not just make-believe

[Outro]
Somewhere, we will find
Someday, somewhere, we will find
Someday, somewhere, we will find
Someday, somewhere, we will find
