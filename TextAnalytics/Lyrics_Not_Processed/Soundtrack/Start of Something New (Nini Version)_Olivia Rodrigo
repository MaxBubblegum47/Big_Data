[Verse 1]
Livin' in my own world, didn't understand
That anything can happen, when you take a chance
I never believed in, what I couldn't see
I never opened my heart, to all the possibilities, ooh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
And right here, tonight

[Chorus:]
This could be the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, lookin' in your eyes
I feel in my heart (Feel in my heart)
The start of something new

[Bridge:]
I never knew that it could happen, 'til it happened to me
Oh, yeah
I didn't know it before, but now it's easy to see, oh

[Chorus:]
It's the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now, looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something new
