[Verse 1: David Shane]
There's love in the air
All around us everywhere
I can't make it more clear
Can we stay forever?
I remember the night
We stayed awake, got high on life
We drove to the city lights
I guess we lost track of time

[Pre-Chorus: David Shane]
Hey, hey
Jump into the water
We will
Never surrender
Our love
We will never burn out

[Chorus: David Shane]
We will escape this town
We will escape this town
We will escape this town
And we will never burn out
We will escape this town

[Drop: David Shane]
We will escape this town
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
We will escape this town
(We will escape this town)

[Verse 2: David Shane]
When we were young
We loved to party
All summer long
We ran away together
Do you remember?

[Pre-Chorus: David Shane]
Hey, hey
Jump into the water
We will
Never surrender
Our love
We will never burn out

[Chorus: David Shane]
We will escape this town
We will escape this town
We will escape this town
And we will never burn out
We will escape this town

[Drop: David Shane]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
We will escape this town
Jump into the water
We will
Never surrender
Our love
We will never burn out
We will escape this town
