[Verse 1]
I woke up and I checked my bank, like woo there it go
Meetings at the office tryna map out how I blow
Bitches on my line they tryna get up in my car
I told her if she lick me, she get VIP at my shows
This how it go, we get the Fifth and the blow
Bitches and dough, you taking pics then you go
Popped a quarter bar then took a sip for my zone
I woke up from a nap and hit a bitch then I yawn
Pending is done, these niggas envy the one
Give me some grub, need complementary cups
Second they stutter, you little children should run
I swerve up in my pick-up just to pick up my bucks
This shit for fun, you niggas in it to stunt
Give 'em a run then watch 'em give up the love
Pending is done, these niggas envy the one
Quarter tank of gas but I'm still filling my cup

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
I'm bout to drown in the liquor I poured up
Feel like Peter Pan I will never get older
I will never, never land I fall, I fall hard
End up in Michael Jacksons backyard
Lord, captain of hooks when I fish for a bitch
But I might throw her back if the bitches cat fish
She want cashing with a bit of passion
I gets the paper, she gets the plastic
Grocery store, your are just a shore that a nigga will soon explore
Submarinas, subterranean, mediterranean
And figure out that we alien, that's Sigourney Weaver
Call me Julius cause I had to cease her
She want a nigga cause I built my feet up
Then she get me off like misdemeanors
It's so demeaning, that my flow is genius
Like a river had thoughts
Slithering niggas that tried to move and get caught
Sipping on liquor I'm moving in the right spot
I can write a novel if the crackas' wanna plot
Exploit, when the expo, exnay
Extra X-ray, when I escape
Explain cold case when the court date
1207 to the FLA

[Outro]
Meetings at the office tryna map how I blow
Meetings at the office tryna map how I blow
Meetings at the office tryna map how I blow
Meetings at the office tryna map how I blow
I told her if she lick me, she get VIP at my shows
I told her if she lick me, she get VIP at my shows
This how it go, we get the Fifth and the
This how it go, we get the Fifth and the blow
