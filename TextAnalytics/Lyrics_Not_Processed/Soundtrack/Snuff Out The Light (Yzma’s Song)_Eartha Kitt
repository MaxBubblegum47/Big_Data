When a woman acquires a certain age
And the men who adored you no longer swoon
It pays to avoid the sunlit days
And live by the light of the kindly moon

But the moon grows old just like us all
And her beautiful years are done
So now she prays through endless days
To take her revenge on the sun

When I was a girl at my daddy's side
Papa, the royal mortician
Revealed to me in secret signs
The mark of the magician

And daddy was no dummy
Did outrageous things with a mummy
And often the stiffs that he would shrive
Would look better dead than they did alive

I studied well, I learnt the trade
I thought my looks would never fade
If I could find that recipe
To give eternal youth to me

It was always my ambition
To use papa's tuition
And gain some small remission
From the vagaries of time

Every little ray of sunshine robs me of my youth
Who to blame? Who the one? Who to curse?
You know the only one to blame
Would be my enemy the sun

Snuff out the light
Claim your right to a world of darkness
Snuff out the light, neophytes
Of a world of darkness

Ha!
Supai, baby, turn me on
Every wrinkle soon be gone
I could squeeze myself with glee
The promises you made to me

I've really stopped at nothing
Murder, treachery, and lying
Whatever it takes to keep my looks
You really can't blame a girl for trying

Ha!
Snuff out the light
Claim your right to a world of darkness
Snuff out the light, neophytes
Of a world of darkness

Snuff out the light
Claim your right to a world of darkness
Snuff out the light here tonight

Apparitions of eternal darkness
Spiraling in circles through the night
Creatures of beguiling blackness
No more squinting in the light

Bats and owls and coiled sea dragons
Crocodile and carrion beasts
Swirling in the growing darkness
Join us in the coming feast

Spectre, wraith, and apparition
Spirit, demon, phantom shade
Salamander, serpents, dog-faced devils
Dance and watch the dying sunlight fade
