[All]
525,600 minutes
525,000 moments so dear
525,600 minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?

In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife
In 525,600 minutes
How do you measure a year in the life?

How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love

[Joanne]
525,600 minutes
525,000 journeys to plan
525,600 minutes
How do you measure the life of a woman or man?

[Collins]
In truths that she learned, or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned, or the way that she died

[All]
It's time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate, remember a year
In the life of friends

[All & Joanne]
Remember the love
You got to, you got to remember the love
Remember the love
You know that love is a gift from up above
Remember the love
Share love, give love, spread love
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Measure, measure your life in love
