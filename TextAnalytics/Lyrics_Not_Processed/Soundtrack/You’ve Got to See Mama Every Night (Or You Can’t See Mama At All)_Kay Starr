You gotta see your mama every night
Or you can't see your mama at all
You've got to kiss your mama, treat her right
Or I won't be home when you call
Now I don't like that kind o' man
That makes love on the installment plan
You gotta see your mama every night
Or you won't see your mama at all
Monday night, you didn't show
Tuesday night, you claimed no dough
Wednesday night, that same old stall
Thursday night, you didn't call
Friday night, you dogged my path
Saturday night, you took your bath
Sunday night, you had a date
And from the looks of everything
It's clear that I don't rate
Hey you, you better show tonight
Or you won't see your mama at all
You better kiss me, you better hold me right
Or I won't be home when you call
Now I don't like that kind o' man
That operates on the installment plan
You better see me, you better make things right
Or you won't see your mama at all
Cut out all this stallin'
Cut in some callin'
Or you won't see your mamma at all
