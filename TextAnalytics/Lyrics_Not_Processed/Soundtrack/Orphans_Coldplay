[Intro: Chris Martin & Choir, 
Moses Martin
]
I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
Boom boom kah, boom de kah
Boom boom kah, boom de kah
Boom boom kah, boom de kah

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Rosaleem of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon

[Refrain: Chris Martin & Choir]
She went (Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Indigo up in heaven today
(Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Bombs going boom-ba-ba-boom
She say

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Choir]
I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune

[Refrain: Chris Martin & Choir]
But he went (Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Tulips the colour of honey today
(It's true, true, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Bombs going boom-ba-ba-boom
He say

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Choir]
Oh, I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again (Yeah)

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Cherubim, Seraphim soon
Come sailing us home by the light of the moon

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Choir]
Oh, I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and feel home again

[Refrain: Chris Martin & Choir]
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
I guess we'll be raised on our own then
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause I want to be with you 'til the world ends
I want to be with you 'til the whole world ends

[Outro: Moses Martin]
Boom boom kah, boom de kah
Boom boom kah, boom de kah
Boom boom kah, boom de kah
Boom
