[Verse 1]
Your words, yeah they wreck me when they roll off your lips
The high that you give me is good as it gets
No bottle of anything does what you do to me right now
Right now

[Chorus]
Don't wanna let your feet hit the cold hard floor
With every kiss I steal, I wanna steal more
You've got me right here in the palm of your hand
Keep falling for you, falling like I'll never land
You lay your head where my heartbeat hits
It feels like gravity just doesn't exist
Even if we wanna stop, we know we can't
I'm falling for you, falling like I'll never land

[Verse 2]
We hang on each other like it's our last dance
We stretch every song out as long as we can
We float like the melody making up memories, all night
All night

[Chorus]
Don't wanna let your feet hit the cold hard floor
With every kiss I steal, I wanna steal more
You've got me right here in the palm of your hand
Keep falling for you, falling like I'll never land
You lay your head where my heartbeat hits
It feels like gravity just doesn't exist
Even if we wanna stop, we know we can't
I'm falling for you, falling like I'll never land
Falling like I'll never land

[Bridge]
The way you say "Why don't you stay?" gets me flying

[Chorus]
Don't wanna let your feet hit the cold hard floor
With every kiss I steal, I wanna steal more
You've got me right here in the palm of your hand
Keep falling for you, falling like I'll never land
You lay your head where my heartbeat hits
It feels like gravity just doesn't exist
Even if we wanna stop, we know we can't
I'm falling for you, falling like I'll never land
Falling like I'll never land
Falling like I'll never land

[Outro]
Falling, falling, falling like I'll never land
Falling, falling, falling like I'll never land
Falling, falling, falling like I'll never land
