[Verse 1]
So much has happened
Think of what we've done
In the time that the Earth
Has traveled 'round the Sun
Winter, spring, summer
And we're back to fall
We've been together
Hand-in-hand through it all

[Pre-Chorus]
From the minute we kissed
And my heart skipped a beat
To the night that we danced
I was swept off my feet
Sure as every year has to come to an end
I'd go spinning 'round the Sun
With you again and again
And again and again

[Chorus]
I think I kinda, you know
I think I kinda, you know
Like the way that we flow
Like the way that we go
And I love
I think I kinda, you know
I think I kinda, you know
You know, you know

[Outro]
I can't help dreamin' of you
Guess I'm sayin' I don't not love you
You know, you know, you know
