I've been watching you, you've been hurting too
You give all your love, nothing left to show
I have been there too, alone in my despair
Watching life go by, no one whom to share
Boy you got it bad, but I got something good
I will treat you good in every way, yeah
You will never feel alone, my touch is such a rush
It oh-oh-overflows
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more
I will give to you the love you seek and more
You're what I'm waiting for
I will give to you the love you seek and more
You're all I really need
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more
Baby here we are, standing face to face
Just the two of us, locked in your embrace
Now I got it bad but you got something good
Won't you treat me good in every way, yeah
Are you ready ? I can feel your passion and your love
It oh-oh-overflows
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more
I got the love, you seek, I got the love, you seek
I got the love, you seek, I got the love
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I will give to you the love you seek and more
(The love you seek, baby, its in me)
I will give to you the love you seek and more
(You always want baby)
I will give to you the love you seek and more
