[Intro]
Hey
That's right

[Verse 1]
Asked sweet mama, let me be her kid
She said, "You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid"
Well, I know my baby if I see her in the dark
I said, I know my rider if I see her in the dark

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm going to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Still barrel house, but it's on the riverside, yeah
I know my baby, Lord, I said, is really sloppy drunk
I know my mama, Lord, a brown-skin, but she ain't no plum
Uh-huh, see my baby, tell her, tell her hurry home
Had no loving since my baby been gone
See my baby, tell her hurry on home
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind
Since my rider's been gone
Hey, she promises, she's my rider
I want to tell you, she's my rider
I know you're mine, she's my rider
She ain't but sixteen, but she's my rider
I'm going to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Anybody ask if you and me met, I keep them satisfied
But, uh, see my baby, tell her, tell her to shake my milk
Ain't no Lord since you nowhere
Ah, yeah

[Bridge]
Won't you come in my kitchen

[Verse 3]
She's a kindhearted lady
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed
Squeeze my lemon
'til the juice runs down my leg
I wonder if you know what I'm talking about
Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl
I swear I'm going to  fall right out of bed

[Verse 4]
Ah, she's a good rider
She's my kindhearted lady
I'm going to take my rider by my side, yeah
I said her front teeth are lined with gold
She's got a mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul
She's my brown-skin sugar plum
