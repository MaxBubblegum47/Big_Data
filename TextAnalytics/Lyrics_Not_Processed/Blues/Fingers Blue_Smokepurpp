[Intro: Smokepurpp]
Oh my God, Ronny
'Til my fingers blue
Yuh, I like countin' hunnids 'til my fingers blue
Lil Purpp, yuh (Huh, huh?)

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I just fucked this bitch inside a Bentley Coupe, uh (Bentley Coupe)
Hopped up in the Wraith, got stars up on the roof, huh (Skrt)
I like selling mid because I smoke the Boof, huh
I be countin' hunnids 'til my fingers blue (Bih)
'Til my fingers blue (Bih), 'til my fingers blue, huh
I like countin' hunnids 'til my fingers blue (Count up)
'Til my fingers blue (Bih), 'til my fingers blue (Fingers blue)
I like countin' hunnids 'til my fingers blue (Fingers blue)

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
Hop out the whip, I'm in the kitchen, I whip (Whip)
Choppa on me (Blat), shots to the head make him sit (Blat)
Yeah I'm the shit, all of my songs is a hit, I don't miss (Damn)
Smokin' on gas in the VIP, poppin' champagne on a bitch (Bop)
Heard you a snitch
Nigga, be quiet 'cause you can get bitched (You can get bitched)
I keep a choppa, it's loaded
Hop out the Rolls, got my name on the curtain (Skrt)
Fuckin' yo' thot, and I do that for certain (Yuh)
And I stay clean like detergent
Poppin' on Xannies and poppin' on Percies (Perc)
Run up on me, you get cut like a turkey (Brr)

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I just fucked this bitch inside a Bentley Coupe, uh (Bentley Coupe)
Hopped up in the Wraith, got stars up on the roof, huh (Skrr)
I like selling mid because I smoke the Boof, huh
I be countin' hunnids 'til my fingers blue (Bih)
'Til my fingers blue (Bih), 'til my fingers blue, huh
I like countin' hunnids 'til my fingers blue (Count up)
'Til my fingers blue (Bih), 'til my fingers blue (Fingers blue)
I like countin' hunnids 'til my fingers blue (Fingers blue)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
'Til my fingers blue, 'til my fingers flew
I like countin' hunnids 'til my fingers blue (Yeah)
Lamborghini roadster, this is not the Coupe (Skrr-skrr, skrr-skrr, skrr-skrr)
If I slide the top off, then you better shoot (Yeah)
Diamond teeth (Shine), diamonds white and pink (It's lit)
Yeah, back in sync, just in time to drink (Yeah)
Still strawberry smooth (Yeah), still, roll off the boof (Yeah)
Hit her off the view (Yeah), top floor, where are you? (Yeah)
Yeah, all she do is dance and take Xans, she too basic (Yeah, yeah)
If she ever plan on fall asleep, my hands replace them (Yeah, yeah)
Whole damn crew (Yeah) off the zoot (Yeah)
Pour the juice (Yeah), hit the jack and count the deads (Yeah)

[Chorus: Smokepurpp & Travis Scott]
I just fucked this bitch inside a Bentley Coupe, uh
Hopped up in the Wraith, got stars up on the roof, huh
I like selling mid because I smoke the Boof
I be countin' hunnids 'til my fingers blue
'Til my fingers blue, till my fingers blue
I like countin' hunnids 'til my fingers blue
'Til my fingers blue, 'til my fingers blue
I like countin' hunnids 'til my fingers blue
