[Verse 1]
Oh, nobody's fault but mine
Nobody's fault but mine
Trying to save my soul tonight

[Hook]
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

[Verse 2]
Devil he taught me to roll
Devil he taught me to roll
How to roll the lot you like

[Hook]
Nobody's fault but mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Brother he showed me the gong
Brother he showed me the ding dong ding dong
How to kick that gong to light

[Hook]
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

[Verse 4]
Got a monkey on my back
M-m-m-m-monkey on my back, back, back, back
Gonna change my ways tonight

[Hook]
Nobody's fault but mine

[Outro]
How to kick that gong to light
N-n-n-n-n-no, nobody's fault
