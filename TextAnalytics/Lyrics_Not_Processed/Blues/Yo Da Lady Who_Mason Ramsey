[Intro]
Yo da lady who
Yo da lady who

[Verse 1]
Put the trick in my magic, keep my train on the track
Put the sweet in my coffee, keep my foot on the gas
Put the slow in my motion, got my wrong in the right
Get me up in the mornin', keep me up all night

[Chorus]
Yo da lady who
Yo da lady who
You don't have to wonder where my love is goin' to
Baby, yo da lady who
Yo da lady who

[Verse 2]
Put the slick in my step, put the sway in my body
Put the boom, boom, boom... in my body
Put the trip in my travel, put the rain on my roots
Spread the paint on my Picasso, put the scoot in my boots

[Chorus]
Yo da lady who
Yo da lady who
You don't have to wonder where my love is goin' to
Baby, yo da lady who

[Bridge]
Come a little closer, baby
Take me to the place you take me
Fire me up and drive me crazy
Like only you knows who can do

[Chorus]
Yo da lady who
Yo da lady who
You don't have to wonder where my love is goin' to
Baby, yo da lady who
