I got my mojo working, but it just don't work on you
I got my mojo working, but it just don't work on you
I want to love you so bad, 'till I just don't know what to do
I'm going down to Louisiana, to get me a mojo hand
I'm going down to Louisiana, to get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna have all you women, get you under my command

I got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
I got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
I got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
I got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
But it just don't work on me

I got a gypsy woman giving me advice
I got a gypsy woman giving me advice
I got a whole lot of tricks keeping here on ice
I got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
I got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
I got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
I got my mojo working
Got my mojo working
But it just don't work on me
