Three's company
Come on

[Verse 1]
Last stand, and on my last dime
I ain't got the sense to leave, the dealer's cutting fine
Last throw, back against the wall
Dependin' where the money is, is where I'm going to fall
Ace high, hide your poker eyes
I didn't want to laugh too much when I picked up the prize
Lady Luck standing at my side
I leave with more than I brought in, and I'll get out with my life
Get out with my life

[Pre-Chorus]
I go, you go
She go, we go

[Chorus]
Two's up
Yeah, it's a two's up
Gimme head (Two's up)
Gimme tails (Two's up)
Gimme double up and coming, doubled over on the rails
Gimme two's up, it's what I want, yeah
Alright

[Verse 2]
High up, when you're looking down
Then you see two animals just foolin' you around
Stray dogs, gonna take them in
I don't know what your names are
Where you're goin' and where you been
All day, it's difficult to say
Who is doing what to who, who's out on the play
I love the way you slide and slip
Like the way you girls work and ya make that partnership
Make that partnership

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
(Gotta give me double or quits)

[Bridge]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Two's up, two's up
Like your partnership
Like the way you slip, ooh
There ain't nothing like a (Two's up)
That's the way it is, (Two's up)
It's what I want to hear
Gimme head (Two's up)
Gimme tails (Two's up)
Gimme double up and coming, over on the rails
(Two's up), it's locomotion
(Two's up), you drive me wild
Gimme high (Two's up)
Gimme low (Two's up)
Gimme twice the satisfaction, twice as far to go
And it's a (Two's up)
It's gonna be (Two's up)
We're going to have a two's up, two's up, two's up, two's up
There ainâ€™t nothing like a two's up
