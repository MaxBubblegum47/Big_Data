Turutu, turutu

[Verse 1]
Come on in take a seat next to me
You know we got, we got what you need
We may be liars preaching to choirs
But we can, we can sell you dreams
You don't need sympathy
They got a pill for everything
Just take that dark cloud
Wring it out to wash it down, but

[Chorus]
Don't pray for us
We don't need no Modern Jesus to roll with us
The only rule we need is never givin' up
The only faith we have is faith in us

[Post-Chorus]
Turututurutu
Turututurutu
Turututurutu
Turutu, turutu

[Verse 2]
We're the ones who start little fires
Yet they burn out
But when they're on the rise
They can't help but shine
And when the wave approaches
Take our ashes to the ocean
Who cares if Hell awaits?
We're having drinks at Heaven's Gate, so

[Chorus]
Don't pray for us
We don't need no Modern Jesus to roll with us
The only rule we need is never givin' up
The only faith we have is faith in us

[Bridge]
We know that we're helpless, at least we always assumed
But we don't need to prove nothing to you
Let's keep the cool, you don't need to feel blue
'Cause we won't sell you nothing, you can't use

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Don't pray for us
We don't need no Modern Jesus to roll with us
The only rule we need is never givin' up
The only faith we have is faith in us

[Post-Chorus]

Turututurutu
Turututurutu
Turutu, turutu
