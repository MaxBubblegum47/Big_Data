[Verse 1]
Oh, know I feel so strange looking out the door
Oh, trying hard to change and can't let it go
Oh, crying tears of pain, hurting more and more
Oh, every day's the same as you walk the floor

[Bridge]
I'm walking the floor over you
I'm walking the floor

[Verse 2]
Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
Oh, to the hand that takes your dreamless soul
Oh, is it long to wait, is there much to pay?
Oh, sometimes it's hard waiting for the day

[Chorus]
You know it's hard, I said it's hard
You know it's true
I said it's hard, you know it's hard
Still know it's true

[Verse 3]
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

[Verse 4]
Every love that's changed spend it fully
In the eyes of the night was it hard to see?
If it never fails in spite of it all
So you hide in the tears, enter Walter's walk

[Chorus]
You know it is true now
You know it is true now
Ooh, yeah

[Solo]

[Bridge]
I am walking the floor over you
I am walking the floor

[Verse 3]
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

[Outro]
Does it matter now?
Does it, now does it matter?
Does it matter?
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh, little baby, don't you know
Every tear that falls, does it matter now?
Does it matter now?
Oh yeah
Oh yes
Oh yes
