[Verse 1]
I see you tweeting, talking, but you acting phony
And nigga I don't need the clout
Don't need the cameras on me
You must've thought your mans was bad
You gassed up on him till I had to press the button
Press the gas and press up on him
This a warning
Don't come back to California
I won't even hit your shawty
My dick too expensive for her
I guess the question who got hits
'Cause you ain't lookin' for me
I sent all my hitters out to get ya
Ya'll some ten year old kids
Tweetin' like this "I'll fuck your mom little bitch"
Ski Mask you actin' like you wasn't on tour jealous of me
Flexin' on me, I told you don't test me homie
How your mans gon' leave you out here hangin'
You should question homie

[Hook]
XXX this extra credit for me
I don't need tentacion
I need bands and diamonds blingin' on me
XXX you resurrected on me
I'll wax you niggas on the black top
And wax niggas on beats

[Verse 2]
Okay now let me get this right, you beat a pregnant women?
My nigga who can rock with that, you need a lesson for it
And second off you actin' soft depressed lil' homie
And you put my number out
Now that's some shit a groupie hoe would do
But please don't make me talk about the video
Mask off, ass out, if you didn't know
And then you post one of a dumb bitch out here givin' throat
Stating that's my baby mama but she barely left out Diego
You niggas is gay hoes, better do as I say so
Know your mama mad she can't ever confess you ugly
Direct lil' homie, stainless at ya neck I'm bugglin'
Won't you Etch A Sketch or somethin'
Address ain't correct or nothin'

[Hook]
XXX this extra credit for me
I don't need tentacion
I need motivation, cash or somethin'
XXX you resurrected on me
I knew that you would be who mad
When you see me on your screen

[Bridge]
XXX this extra credit for me
XXX this ain't a test, I'm tauntin'
XXX you extra weird and harmless
Don't be pressin' on me
I can X you out the game you started
XXX this extra credit for me
XXX this ain't a test, I'm tauntin'
XXX you extra weird and harmless
Don't be pressin' on me
I can X you out the game you started
