[Intro: Grandmother, Girl 1 & Girl 2]
Do that one dance, baby
That, that one dance
Yeah, oh
You don't know how to do that?
Baby do it for your grandma
Come on, I'm old and I'm trying to learn it
Well, yeah, do it
Oh my god, oh my god. Girl, ain't that Zay and Zayion?
Yas
Don't both of 'em got a girlfriend?
Girl, I don't care
I don't care, girl, he still cute
Oh yes, he is!

[Verse 1: Zay Hilfiger]
Walked in this party and these girls lookin' at me
Skinny jeans on and you know my hair nappy
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Okay, okay
I want y'all do it, do this dance now

[Chorus: Zay Hilfiger]
JuJu on the beat
JuJu on that beat
JuJu on that, JuJu on that, JuJu on that beat
Now slide, drop
Hit dem folks, don't stop, ayy
Don't stop, ayy
Don't stop, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat
Now do your dance, do your dance, do your dance, ayy
You ugly
You your daddy's son

[Bridge: Zay Hilfiger]
Ayy, ayy
Do your dance, ayy
Go crazy, ayy
Get freaky, ayy
Let's go, leggo, leggo, leggo, leggo
Hey, hey, hey
Yeah

[Verse 2: Zayion McCall]
Okay, we knuckin' and buckin'
And ready to fight
I got my cousin, he with me
And got Lil Zay on the right
And I'm a Detroit baby
And I don't know nothing else
Besides drinking and having parties
And having some fun
I say look in the mirror
What you expect me to do?
I see a 300-S
And got them blacked out rims
I mean I like your style
I'm on a whole 'nother level
If you compare me and you
There wouldn't be no comparings

[Chorus: Zay Hilfiger]
JuJu on the beat
JuJu on that beat
JuJu on that, JuJu on that, JuJu on that beat
Now slide, drop
Hit dem folks, don't stop, ayy
Don't stop, ayy
Don't stop, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat
Now do your dance, do your dance, do your dance, ayy
You ugly
You your daddy's son
