[Intro]
Singin' Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singin' "Here's to never growing up"

[Verse 1]
Call up all our friends
Go hard this weekend
For no damn reason
I don't think we'll ever change
Meet you at the spot
Half past ten o'clock
We don't ever stop
And we're never gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, won't you say forever?
Stay, if you stay forever
Hey, we can stay forever young

[Chorus]
Singin' Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singin' "Here's to never growing up"
We'll be running down the street yelling "Kiss my ass"
I'm like yeah, whatever, we’re still living like that
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups
Singin' "Here's to never growing up"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
(Here's to never growing up)
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
(Here's to never growing up)

[Verse 2]
We live like rock stars
Dance on every bar
This is who we are
I don't think we'll ever change (Hell no)
They say "Just grow up"
But they don't know us
We don't give a fuck
And we're never gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, won't you say forever?
Stay, if you stay forever
Hey, we can stay forever young

[Chorus]
Singin' Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singin' "Here's to never growing up"
We'll be running down the street yelling "Kiss my ass"
I'm like yeah, whatever, we’re still living like that
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups
Singin' "Here's to never growing up"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
(Here's to never growing up)
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
(Here's to never growing up)

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, won't you say forever?
Stay, if you stay forever
Hey, we can stay forever young

[Chorus]
(Oh) Singin' Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singin' "Here's to never growing up"
We'll be running down the street yelling "Kiss my ass"
I'm like yeah, whatever, we’re still living like that (Like that)
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups
Singin' "Here's to never growing up"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
(Here's to never growing up)
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa (So raise your glass and say)
Cheers to never growing up

[Outro]
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
(Here's to never growing up)
No, we're never growing up
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Here's to never growing up
