[Verse 1]
Ah, because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round

[Verse 2]
Ah, because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high

{Chorus}
Ah, love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

[Verse 3]
Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

[Outro]
Ahh-ah-ah-ahhhh
