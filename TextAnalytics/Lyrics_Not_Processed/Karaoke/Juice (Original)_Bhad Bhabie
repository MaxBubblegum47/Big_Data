[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
Fuck it to a Bentley, bitch (Bitch)
Rags to fucking riches, bitch (Bitch)
Fuck up out my mentions, bitch (Ho)
Fuck you and your picket fence (Bitch)
Pull up like I miss you, bitch (Miss you, ho)
Shoot it 'til it's empty, bitch (Broke bitch)
Hangin' out the window with it
Who the fuck gon' mention this? (Who the fuck?)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie & 
YNW Melly
]
I beat the braids off that bitch, J's off that bitch
Come through in a Wraith on that bitch
, sprayed on that bitch (Bitch)
Diamonds drip off my clock, I finesse on yo block
Water drip off my chain, I make a mess on yo block (Mess on yo block)
I got the juice bitch, I got the motherfuckin' juice
I got the juice bitch, I got the motherfuckin' juice (Bitch)
Diamonds drip off my clock, I finesse on yo block
Water drip off my chain, I make a mess on yo block
I got the juice bitch (On yo block)
I got the juice (
Young Nigga World
), I got the juice bitch (On yo block) (
Young Nigga World, ayy
)
I got the motherfuckin' juice (
Young Nigga Way
)

[Verse 2: YNW Melly]
If he run up on me, it's gon' be a homicide
I got niggas really riding for me, wrong or right
Boy, you snitching, yeah, we seen it on the black and white
Up this cannon and I send your ass to paradise
Lukewarm, don't mean no harm
Uh, dick gon' poke in her just like a thorn (Just like a thorn!)
Dick gonna poke in your bitch,
 huh
Laying inside of your bushes with the sticks
She wanna fuck on Lil' Melly and get rich
She eat the dick like some shrimp and grits
Hop out the coupe with the 40 Glock (40 Glock)
And no, we are not friends with benefits (Bitch)
Bitch nigga, you get hit up with the whole fucking extension clip

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
I beat the braids off that bitch, J's off that bitch
Come through in a Wraith on that bitch, sprayed on that bitch (Bitch)
Diamonds drip off my clock, I finesse on yo block
Water drip off my chain, I make a mess on yo block (Mess on yo block)
I got the juice bitch, I got the motherfuckin' juice
I got the juice bitch, I got the motherfuckin' juice (Bitch)
Diamonds drip off my clock, I finesse on yo block
Water drip off my chain, I make a mess on yo block
I got the juice bitch (On yo block)
I got the juice, I got the juice bitch (On yo block)
I got the motherfuckin' juice

[Open Verse/Instrumental]

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
I beat the braids off that bitch, J's off that bitch
Come through in a Wraith on that bitch, sprayed on that bitch (Bitch)
Diamonds drip off my clock, I finesse on yo block
Water drip off my chain, I make a mess on yo block (Mess on yo block)
I got the juice bitch, I got the motherfuckin' juice
I got the juice bitch, I got the motherfuckin' juice (Bitch)
Diamonds drip off my clock, I finesse on yo block
Water drip off my chain, I make a mess on yo block
I got the juice bitch (On yo block)
