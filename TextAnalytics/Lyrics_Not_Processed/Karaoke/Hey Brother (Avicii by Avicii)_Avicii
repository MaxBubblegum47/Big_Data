[Verse 1]
Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
If you ever think my blood is thicker

[Refrain]
Oh, wear the liar's heart on my sleeve
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
Oh, what if I'm far from home
Oh brother,I will hear you call
What if I lose all?
Oh brother,I will help you out
Wear the liar's heart on my sleeve
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Verse 3]
Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
If you ever think my blood is thicker

[Refrain]
Oh, wear the liar's heart on my sleeve
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
