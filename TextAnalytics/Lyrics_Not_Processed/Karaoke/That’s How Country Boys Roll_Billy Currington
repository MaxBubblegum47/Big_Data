[Verse 1]
They wake up in the morning and they drink their coffee black
They love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work they might stop by a fishing hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work, all week til the job gets done
Weekends they bar-b-que and have a cold one
They run on a big ol' heart and a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll

[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll

[Verse 2]
Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold
That's how country boys roll

[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll

[Outro]
Aw come on now
Yeah they're crying aloud
Humble and proud
They love moma and Jesus and Jones
That's how country boys roll
Don't you know
