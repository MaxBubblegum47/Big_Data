[Verse 1]
The video games say, "Play me"
Face it on a level, but I take you every time on a one-on-one
Feelin' running down your spine
Nothin' gonna save your one last dime cause it own you
Through and through

The databank know my number
Says I got to pay 'cause I made the grade last year
Feel it when I turn the screw
Kick you 'round the world
There ain’t a thing that it can't do
Do to you, yeah

[Chorus]
Who made who, who made you?
Who made who, ain’t nobody told you?
Who made who, who made you?
If you made them and they made you
Who picked up the bill and who made who?
Who made who, who turned the screw?

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Satellites send me picture
Get it in the aisle
Take it to the wire
Spinnin' like a dynamo
Feel it goin' round and round
Running outta chips, you got no line in an 8-bit town
So don't look down, no




[Chorus]
Who made who, who made you?
Who made who, ain’t nobody told you?
Who made who, who made you?
If you made them and they made you
Who picked up the bill and who made who?
Ain't nobody told you?

Who made who?
Who made you?
Who made who?
And who made who?
Yeah
Nobody told you?
