(Lovesick girls)
I think I'm done
Chasing, endless running, looking for this love
What can we say?
And yet I wanna hurt feel this love
Although I bleed and I break down
Don't know what's making me stay,why
What if I leave you, will I only hate you again just like I did before?
Goodbye means nothing until it's not over
It's like we have longed for it all along
What if we're  just looking for a moment?
Tell me what we're looking for so aimless tonight?
But I don’t care I’ll do it over and over
I need you here and now, I need you stay
We are the lovеsick girls
No you can't end this lovе like this until I say so
We arе the lovеsick girls
We feel like nothing when we don't feel this pain at all
But we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love
No love letters, no X and O's
No love, never, my exes know
No diamond rings, that set in stone
To the left, better left alone
Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless
A prince not even on my list
Love is a drug that I quit
No doctor could help when I'm lovesick
What if we're looking just for a moment?
Tell me what we're looking for so aimless tonight?
But I'm afraid how I look at you, I know
It hurts my heart but I still need you to stay
We are the lovеsick girls
No you can't end this love like this until I say so
We arе the lovesick girls
We feel like nothing when we don't feel this pain at all
But we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love
Suddenly slippin’ and fallin’
Suddenly killin’ you darlin’
And when the pain is fading
Finally fearless I'll keep going
Can’t even hear what you say
I am really happy with pain
You say that you feel sorry but I'm sorry you feel this way
We are the lovеsick girls
No you can't end this love like this until I say so
We arе the lovesick girls
We feel like nothing when we don't feel this pain at all

(Lovesick girls)
At some point they all want to go
(Lovesick girls)
I have no more tears to cry no
(Lovesick girls)
I was hurt and hurt before
(Lovesick girls)
But we're still looking for love
