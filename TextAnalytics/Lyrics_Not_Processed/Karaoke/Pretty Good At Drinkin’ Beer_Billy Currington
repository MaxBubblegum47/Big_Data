[Verse 1]
I wasn't born for diggin' deep holes
I'm not made for pavin' long roads
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer

[Verse 2]
I'm not the type to work in a bank
I'm no good at slapping on paint
Don't have a knack for making motors crank, no
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer

[Chorus]
So hand me one more
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the nightlife
I love my Bud Light
I like 'em cold and tall

[Verse 3]
I ain't much for mowin' thick grass
I'm too slow for workin' too fast
I don't do windows so honey don't ask
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer

[Verse 4]
A go-getter
Well, maybe I'm not
I'm not known for doin' a lot
But I do my best work when the weather's hot
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer

[Chorus]
So hand me one more
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the nightlife
I love my Bud Light
I like 'em cold and tall

[Verse 1]
I wasn't born for diggin' deep holes
I'm not made for pavin' long roads
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer
I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer

[Outro] [Spoken]
Oh, hand me one more boys
That's what I'm here for
