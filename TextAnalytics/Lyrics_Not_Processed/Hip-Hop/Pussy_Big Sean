[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Push! Oh boy, she want a dope boy
She want to throw bands on her pole dance
No test drive on the 2 door
She want to stunt with me on her old man
Oh God, my IG is like IV to this lifestyle
I buy this shit, take a pic, and you OD on my life files

[Verse 2: The Dream]
Shawty get it, get it, do it big, do it good
Work it like a girl should, work it good, work it good
Bring it back, bring it back, tell the DJ bring it back
Let me touch it, fuck it baby, tell your man he ain’t getting it back
Shawty is so ratchet, baby I’m so ratchet
You so bomb with that, I got to have it
I got to have it, like a nine, I got to blast it
So fine I got to grab it, she don't mind

[Hook: The Dream]
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
(I love it) Now keep that booty rolling like that
Keep that pussy poppin like that
I'mma keep these bands poppin like that
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy

[Verse 3: The Dream]
Up in that six hundred, you ain't even seen it
Touchin on it, rubbin on it, girl you got me feenin'
All about her money and I'm all about my money
Million dollar babies plus alimony
First a nigga save you (then a nigga crave you)
And ain't nobody got time for that
So it's best just to pay ya
Thirteen cars I don't need nothing else
Just this booty on my lap and this gold on my neck

[Hook: The Dream]
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
(I love it) Now keep that booty rolling like that
Keep that pussy poppin like that
I'mma keep these bands poppin like that
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
The way you do got me very very very happy
She stare at me while I'm starin' at it
I'm a young sexy ass charismatic-ass
Gorgeous face-ass havin ass nigga
That she love in her panty hose
She need this dick like it's antidote
That pussy is a work of art painted by Michelangelo
I wake up the pussy in cantaloupe
Then she made me fuck my appetite
Fuckin so hard, I'mma remember this in the afterlife
I tell her slob on my knob
Like it's corn on the cob, she keep goin, oh my God
And my broad is so bad, I can't hit it from the back
All my favorite girls got my initials as tats
Finally Famous, she throw this set up like sororities and frats
Niggas can't tell me shit but congrats, congrats

[Hook: The Dream]
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
(I love it) Now keep that booty rolling like that
Keep that pussy poppin like that
I'mma keep these bands poppin like that
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy

[Outro: The Dream]
Pull up to that traffic light, stars bright, wanna touch her
Gotta get her to the spot, oh shit, I might love her
Straight up out of med school, could be my baby momma...
I got my left hand on that booty, got my right hand on that pussy
