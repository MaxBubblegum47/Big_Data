[Verse 1: GASHI]
My heart going up and down when it’s you I see (I see)
All these girls so salty 'cause you’re so sweet (So sweet)
You ain’t the one that I want, you the one I need (Woah)
Telling your friends that you’re really not in love with me

[Pre-Chorus: GASHI]
You can keep on frontin' but I know
You like that, why you acting like that?
You can keep on frontin' but I know (Know)
You like that (Like that), why you acting like that? (Like that)

[Chorus: GASHI]
Because you creep on me when you’re alone (Alone)
And you act like you can’t fall in love
Every single night you call my phone
Always asking if nobody’s home (Yeah)
Come around like the summer time
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright
Come around like the summer time
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: DJ Snake]
"Pay attention 'round me," you said
"Pay attention 'round me," you said

[Verse 2: GASHI]
I never thought that our love would've gone so deep
And if it ain't love then I don't really know what it means
This is something that we always dreamed
No holding back, don't be shy, put it all on me (All on me)
You can keep on ranting, but I know, you like that
Why you acting like that?
You can keep on ranting, but I know, you like that
Why you acting like that?

[Chorus: GASHI]
Because you creep on me when you’re alone (Alone)
And you act like you can’t fall in love
Every single night you call my phone
Always asking if nobody’s home (Yeah)
Come around like the summer time
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright
Come around like the summer time
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: DJ Snake]
"Pay attention 'round me," you said
"Pay attention 'round me," you said

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Ayy, ayy
Shorty creep on me
And I know ah, and I know ah
Shorty creep on me, I know ah
Creep in the morning, creep in the evening
Creep in the night time (Freak!)
She’s a freak in the morning, freak in the evening
Freak in the night time (Freak!)
Money can’t buy you love, but I know where to find you, love
Aspen’s not the Poconos, not the guy with the open toes (Open toes)
Talk about Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Talk about South Greece, South Beach, Maldives, back to New York and L.A
.

[Chorus: GASHI]
Because you creep on me when you’re alone (Alone)
And you act like you can’t fall in love
Every single night you call my phone
Always asking if nobody’s home (Yeah)
Come around like the summertime
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright
Come around like the summertime
You bring bright light into my life
When I’m with you I feel alright (Yeah)

[Outro: GASHI]
You can keep on frontin' but I know, alright (Yeah, yeah)
You can keep on frontin' but I know, alright, you like
You love me, baby, you love me, yeah, yeah
Alright, oh, oh, alright
