[Intro]
Bizness Boi

[Chorus]
Run to, to me, for three
See, if you need weed, get it from me
It's good
See if you want it, Nas, I got it, nigga, we should go and kick it
See you on the move, but we was cool, now don't forget it
Oh come, get weed from me
It's good

[Verse 1]
Now you all over the place
Check TL, I see your face
You just the nigga these days
My brother showed me your wave
Seen you on the TV, heard that Billboard took your chartin' place
Heard your snippets on IG, man, tell me what's the droppin' dates
My big sister love you nigga, you the G.O.A.T., my uncle say
New pack just came in, my nigga, this that cookie funnel cake

[Chorus]
Run to, to me, for three
See, if you need weed, get it from me
It's good
See if you want it, Nas, I got it, nigga, we should go and kick it
See you on the move, but we was cool, now don't forget it
Oh come, get weed from me
It's good

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Oh, you just that nigga, now, can't pick up, cool, then let me know
You ain't got no talent, nigga, more up in my pinky toe
I just thought that we could kick it, why not let me know?
You'll fall off, I'll give it, oh
Two months, give or take a whole

[Chorus]
Run to, to me, for three
See, if you need weed, get it from me
It's good
See if you want it, Nas, I got it, nigga, we should go and kick it
See you on the move, but we was cool, now don't forget it
Oh come, get weed from me
It's good
