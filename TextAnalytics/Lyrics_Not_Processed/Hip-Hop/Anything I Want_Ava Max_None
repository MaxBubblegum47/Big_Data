[Verse 1]
Talkback to your mother, mean no disrespect
We don't know each other but she's just your normal friend
I'll give you my loving 'til I got nothing left
But I am doing justice with feelings inside my head

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I speak my mind
And I'm sorry if I'm not your type
I ain't here to feed your appetite
So don't get used to hearing what you like

[Chorus]
I say anything I want to you
Even if it comes out wrong, no filter on my tongue
I'm gonna say anything, I'm warning you
And I know it might sound good
But you ain't gon' show me up
Say anything I want to you
Say anything I want to you

[Verse 2]
Don't mind conversation, I'll keep you away
Have the conversation, do we make it better, babe?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I speak my mind
And I'm sorry if I'm not your type
I ain't here to feed your appetite
So don't get used to hearing what you like

[Chorus]
I say anything I want to you
Even if it comes out wrong, no filter on my tongue
I'm gonna say anything, I'm warning you
And I know it might sound good
But you ain't gon' show me up
Say anything I want to you
Say anything I want to you

[Post-Chorus]
Say, say
Say, say, say, say
Say, say, say, say

[Bridge]
I'ma say anything I want you
Even if it comes out wrong
I'ma say anything, I'm warning you
Ooh, ah, ah

[Chorus]
I say anything I want to you
Even if it comes out wrong, no filter on my tongue
I'm gonna say anything, I'm warning you
And I know it might sound good
But you ain't gon' show me up
Say anything I want to you
Say anything I want to you

[Post-Chorus]
Say, say
Say, say, say, say
Say, say, say, say
