[Intro: MGK]
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's

[Chorus: MGK]
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's

[Verse 1: MGK]
I'm a east side Cleveland wild boy, east side Cleveland wild boy
We got baseball bats like the Indians, and my team pop off like Cowboys
You a "white-flag, throw-that-towel" boy, I'm a "jump-right-in-that-crowd" boy
You a "shhh, keep-it-down" boy, and I'm a "fuck-you, blow-that-loud" boy
All I know is how to kill every one of my cells
All they know is they can kill anybody but Kells
I am untouchable, you would think I was in jail
But I'm in Mexico getting marijuana from Miguel
Bring it back into the States, put it on a scale
Measure it at half a eighth, put it in a shell
Split it then I roll it, then light it up like it's Independence Day
I got a bottle rocket, put it in the air
Snapback with my city on it, text back with your titties on it
Levi's, put your kitty on it, start grindin' like the Clipse is on it
Drink it 'til I get pissy, biatch, smoke it 'til I get dizzy, biatch
Lose control like Missy,
 
but I'm a Bad Boy 'cause I'm with Diddy, bitch!

[Bridge: MGK]
There he go, that's John Doe
There he go, that's John Doe
Yeah, there he go, that's John Doe
Nevermind, that's just Kells with that heat
No LeBron though

[Chorus: MGK]
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bricksquad! Uh oh, here come that bullshit
Beat a nigga ass 'til the DJ stop the music
They say they want that wild shit, mosh pit
Jump up in the crowd, bitch, I'm so mothafuckin' violent
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, I'm with Steve-O
We bustin' bottles with bad bitches, blowin' weed smoke
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, I'm with Steve-O
Royal Rumble in the club, John Ce-no
I'm screamin' "Riverdale" everywhere I go
I throw them bands ho, drop it low
Fuck 5-0, I make my own rules
Suck my dragon balls, bitch, call me Goku
(Yeah!) This liquor got the best of me
(Yeah!) This liquor got the best of me
Machine Gun Kelly, Flocka, that's the recipe
You gon' need King Kong if you step to me

[Bridge: MGK]
Yeah, Cobain's back, yeah, Cobain's back
Got these crazy white boys yellin' "Cobain's back"
I call my weed Nirvana, smells like Teen Spirit
And my pack's so fuckin' loud you can't hear it!
Ah!

[Chorus: MGK]
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's
