[Verse 1]
No one knew where he came from
He never knew himself
Called her "Ma", called him "Pa"
But he was born to someone else
No one fooled or messed him 'round
'Cause they were all afraid
Ain't no lies
Ice in the eyes of Leroy Kincaid

[Chorus]
Cold hearted man
One time lover, heart in his hand
Cold hearted man
And you can't trust nothin' you don't understand
Cold hearted man
Cold hearted man

[Verse 2]
Like a snake, he had no friends
He didn't need no one
Hurt his pride deep inside
He was another mother's son
Reputation, broken glass
Everybody prayed for their lives, on the street
Dare they happen to meet Leroy Kincaid

[Chorus]
Cold hearted man
One time lover, heart in his hand
Cold hearted man
And you can't trust nothin' you don't understand
Cold hearted man
Cold hearted man

[Bridge]
Sometimes you can't see
The other side
It's too well hidden
For the naked eye
A one time lover
With his heart in his hand
Two time loser
A broken man

[Chorus]
Cold hearted man
One time lover, heart in his hand
Cold hearted man
And you can't trust nothin' you don't understand
Cold hearted man
Cold hearted man
