Who is the worlds enemy?
Someone who doesn't conform to the worlds ways
But with a sound mind
Innervates a new way

Who is the worlds enemy?
Someone who thinks outside the box
Passionate, indomitable and up right

Who is the worlds enemy?
Someone whose Christ like
And the world does not like

We are the worlds
Enemy
