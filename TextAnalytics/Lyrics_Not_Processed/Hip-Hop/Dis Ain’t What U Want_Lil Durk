[Hook]
Tell me what's it gonna be, yeah, this ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, son, this ain't what you want
I'm on the road, doin' shows so well, this ain't what you want
'Cause the road, you can't go, I know, this ain't what you want
I hear them niggas after me but this ain't what you want (this ain't what you want)
And I guarantee this ain't what you want
I'm from the land where ain't no lackin' at, this ain't what you want
I wrap 'em up, we get it done 'cause this ain't what you want

[Verse 1]
Niggas claim that they're after me but this ain't what they want
'Cause I hopped into this industry, this ain't what they want
See this rap shit ain't shit to me, this ain't what they want
I got the police all into me, this ain't what they want
In my own city they hate on me, put weight on me
Fuck TMZ, fuck breaking news and ABC
I can't do no shows 'cause I terrify my city
They say I terrify my city
Niggas gettin' slumped, you're the first to get blamed
A nigga try us, he the first one to get changed
They say "he snitch", tryna put dirt on my name
They ride on me, ask is Lil Durk my name 
(L's)

[Chorus]
Tell me what's it gonna be, yeah, this ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, son, this ain't what you want
I'm on the road, doin' shows so well, this ain't what you want
'Cause the road, you can't go, I know, this ain't what you want
I hear them niggas after me but this ain't what you want
And I guarantee this ain't what you want
I'm from the land where ain't no lackin' at, this ain't what you want
I wrap 'em up, we get it done 'cause this ain't what you want

[Verse 2]
Daddy doin' life, snitches doin' months
I'm screamin' free the real 'cause this ain't what you want
A nigga claim 300, add a K, you done
I'm really in the field 'cause this is what I want (this what I want)
I'ma turn the streets up, this is a anthem
Niggas hate on my squad, I tell 'em step the shit up (L, Ls)
Same since day one and I can't change up
After all of the gossip, I'll still a-change some
Fuck-niggas don't want none (niggas don't want it)
They don't want it
Same niggas since day one (day one)
Nigga, I'm 3Hunna (L, L's)

[Chorus]
Tell me what's it gonna be, yeah, this ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, son, this ain't what you want
I'm on the road, doin' shows so well, this ain't what you want
'Cause the road, you can't go, I know, this ain't what you want
I hear them niggas after me but this ain't what you want
And I guarantee this ain't what you want
I'm from the land where ain't no lackin' at, this ain't what you want
I wrap 'em up, we get it done 'cause this ain't what you want
(L's, L's)
