[Verse 1]
I hate drinking coffee in the morning
I hate that place everybody goes
If it's fun, I'll probably think it's boring
Just like that song everybody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your hands up in the air
If you hate songs that tell you to
Put your hands up in the air
Up, up, up in the air

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm anti-everything, but I love you
I'm fucking miserable 'til you walk into the room, yeah
I talk a lot of shit, but swear you'll get used to it
'Cause I'm anti-everything, but you
Everything but you
Everything but you
Everything but

[Verse 2]
I hate every second you're not with me
I hate when we have to say goodbye
You're the only one who makes me feel things
'Cause I usually feel nothing inside

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your hands up in the air
If you hate songs that tell you to
Put your hands up in the air
Up, up, up in the air

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm anti-everything, but I love you
I'm fucking miserable 'til you walk into the room, yeah
I talk a lot of shit, but swear you'll get used to it
'Cause I'm anti-everything, but you
Everything but you
Everything but you
Everything but
I'm anti-everything, but I love you
I'm fucking miserable 'til you walk into the room, yeah
I talk a lot of shit, but swear you'll get used to it
'Cause I'm anti-everything, but you
Everything but you

[Outro]
'Cause I'm anti-everything, but I love you
I'm fucking miserable 'til you walk into the room
And I talk a lot of shit, but swear you'll get used to it
'Cause I'm anti-everything, but you
Everything but you
