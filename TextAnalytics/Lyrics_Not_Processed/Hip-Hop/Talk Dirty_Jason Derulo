First-class seat on my lap, girl, riding comfortable (Oh, yeah)
Ha, 'cause I know what da girl dem need, New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, you make it hard to leave

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Been around the world, don't speak the language (Uh-huh)
But your booty don't need explaining (Uh-huh)
All I really need to understand is when you (Uh-huh)
Talk dirty to me

Talk dirty to me (What?)

Talk dirty to me (What?)

I got lipstick stamps on my passport, I think I need a new one

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Been around the world, don't speak the language (Uh-huh)

Chest to chest, tongue on neck (Neck)
International oral sex
Every picture I take, I pose a threat (Yeah; oh)
Bought a jet, what do you expect?
Her pussy so good I bought her a pet (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty" (Haha)
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Been around the world, don't speak the language (Uh-huh)
