[Verse 2: Based Savage]
Poppin' percocets, she's tellin' me to stop that shit
But I can't stop that shit, perkies got me feelin' lit
All relaxed and shit, tryna blow her back and shit
But I can't love that bitch, you know I had to dump that bitch
Doublin' back just to make sure they gone
Fucked that bitch in her back and I'm breakin' her bones
Big ass gun put your ass in the ground
You are not my bitch, stop hittin' my phone
Ayy, she suck on my dick, got me hard as a stone
Psychedelics got me in the mind zone
I just want the money, just leave me alone
Stop stealin' my swag, lil' nigga, you a clone
Ayy, we came up, now niggas be hatin'
Hop out the Wraith, how a nigga be skatin'
Look at my wrist, how a nigga be bakin'
Hittin' that ho', lil' bitch, I ain't cakin'
Want work, now I got your bitch naked
Run up, get fried like some bacon
Shooter with dreads, he look like he Haitian
Based Obama, how I'm running the nation
Bitches be burnt, my niggas be turnt
Your pockets be hurt, ain't nothin' worse
Your life is a curse
I'm feelin' like Kurt, no Angle
Broke lil' niggas, fuck up your ankles
Switch up flow, I feel a lil' uzi
Set it off, I feel like lil boosie
She gave me that brain and threw me that coochie
I throw a lil' money, she shakin' her booty
I wearin' all Prada, she wearin' all Gucci
Let the Glock sing, just like it's lucci
I gave her the soothing, I'm rockin' the nudy
Zone 6 nigga, shout out Young Nudy
Zone 6 nigga, shout out Young Nudy
I've been slime so how could you fool me?
I walk in your trap like you already knew me
I work on her back on I ask for that coochie

[Verse 3: Cochise]
Wait, wait, wait, wait girl, that's my jam
Beat a nigga up, Def Jam

Ballin' like Kevin Durant
