[Intro: The Game]
From California
Born in Seminole Hospital nigga
November 29, 1979
On some G shit
My moms ain't scream or nothing
And I ain't never cried nigga

[Verse 1: The Game]
Motherfucker I'm from Compton, the hub city
I brought some thugs with me
That'll set up shop and get rid of drugs quickly
Drive Cutlass Supremes, on gold D's, puff sticky
Love 2Pac to death and still bump Biggie
Welcome to the west side
Where them Tec's fly
Dope boys drive them S5's
Come smoke and get the best high
Who the fuck said the west died
You dead, this the left side
I will Heckler & Koch, pop shots, for my [Cali Niggas]
Deal niggas, then smoking aces fucking with my [Cali Niggas]
Leave them with poker faces
Red rag, pull it down so they know it's Jayceon
Riding down Wilshire
07 Charger, K&M Filter
High speed burning it up for my [Cali Niggas]
My life real like it was directed by Hype Williams
I started off with visions of stacking Benjamins to the ceiling
The more gang banging, the more killing
The more drug dealing
The more cap peeling
We all [Cali Niggas]

[Verse 2: Ya Boy]
Ay, From Frisco
Never rode a 6-4
They might ghost ride, ghost ride
But Ya Boy is low pro
Stay on the low though
Black Tims, Lacross polo
Black peekhole
Long nose 4-4
Ya never got your hands dirty
I'm outside with the grams early
Puffing life by the gram heard me
High as a bird
Grinding the curb
And if I get caught put me in a cell with my [Cali Niggas]
On the block, busting shots with my Cali Niggas
Fucking with them boys up in Watts, we all [Cali Niggas]
We run deep, hit Compton and rally niggas
Hurricane Game, line them up, let me tally niggas
Trouble makers
Call them big guns, rumble makers
Let the thunderquake 'em introduce them to the undertaker
Palm trees
Big sun with the calm breeze
You can call me one of the re, realest [Cali Niggas]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Yes, Southern Cali
Home of the Chuck Taylors, not Bally's
Far from Vegas, but Sin City
Ab-Soul, put me on it, chronic in the air
Catch the vapors
House parties, hungover through morning, see thats a [Cali Nigga]
You see I'm from the murderous blocks
Compton, California where you'd rather get caught with your gun on you
See it's as hot as a sauna
And in the winter time, niggas don't walk out without kissing they momma
Life of a [Cali Nigga]
Hip-hop trying to take the life of us [Cali Niggas]
Don't call them rappers, address them as Bill O'Reilly niggas
But we gon get them and we kill em, address them as some Hally niggas
Never the more they say they ain't feeling these [Cali Niggas]
When ya'll was ditching class over these hoes man
I was at Centennial catching fades over dice games
That's one years ago, 350 days
350 ways, I switch the flow, a hot [Cali Nigga]
I am a good dude to work with
Destroy your life or destroy these rap verses
Life's a bitch
So I buy whatever she wants, and hope heaven can be my reimbursement
Milk the game until I see her on the couch roaming this earth surface
At first I was parched, but now I'm the thirstiest
Dehydrated
Hungry, frustrated
One of the greatest [Cali Niggas]

[Verse 4: Dubb]
Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey
I'm on the Wall Street like a stock broker
Then I'm back to the hood where they pop toasters
Every nigga screaming war, they is not soldiers
Selling crack in the hood with my [Cali Niggas]
Look, I'm shitting on everything moving
This on my chain ain't a label it's a movement
Fuck with caps, it's a nail in the coffin
Look, I shoot arms like heroin addicts
Look, a hater shit get drastic
You my son, they kill me, you end up a bastard. ha
I got the internet going nuts
Bitches hitting me on myspace say they want to suck him up
You want beef? What the fuck is up?
If so when we meet, I got heat for these [Cali Niggas]
When I spit, the realest will feel something
That's why I stay on the block, I'm still hustling
When you shit on the drop my shit pumping
A spot like a mailbox, it's where the bills come in
Me and Hurricane riding in an S5
Snatch a nigga up, take him for a test drive
Tie the nigga up, show him how the west ride
South Central LA, I'm a [Cali Nigga]
Where the best was born
Make sure your vest is worn
Cause nigga's will split ya chest when the Tec is drawn
Nigga's will split ya deck, then pull your card
Just try to act hard on the boulevard
You know it's me in the coupe when I'm speeding through
The fiend's say I whip colt like a vehicle
It's three birds, a bitch, brick, and four fifth
With them three, I take over the whole strip
No shit
The skinny nigga is no bitch
Know this, I'm so loyal to my [Cali Niggas]

[Verse 5: Jay-Rock]
Crusing through my hood to see whats good
My block considered Death Row but we ain't never signed to Suge
California, I got my heart in it
Disrespect, get ya shot, like I'm bartending
Me and Game we blood brothers with different pops
He the seed of Compton, I'm from Harlem, Watts
Hubbing a dub
Slugging a snub
Busting at any motherfucker who be fucking with us
This is Watts, California, gutterville, U.S.A.,
Gangbang capital, crackhouses, yellow tape
Riding through the city streets
Cannon right under my seat
Chopper in the back of the trunk, who want it with beef?
Seperate your soul from your flesh if you ever hate
Keep your comments to yourself, watch your soul levitate
South Central LA
Nigga it's the place to be
In my house, counting big money is the place for me
Blow good dro, and ride G rides
Gangbanging and cane slanging, the whole nine
Chuck Taylors, red strings, and khaki suits
Black & Milds, Chronic blunts, and Absolut
Killa Kali, fuck scrapping we clap you fool
Fuck the talk, bring your gat, we're blasting two's
From the block to the booth I'm the realest
Jay-Rock nigga and I do it for my [Cali Niggas]

[Verse 6: Topic]
Who the fuck want to snatch you from me?
And I don't chase bitches nigga I chase after money
Cannibal hungry
Trying to eat till my belly bust
I'm Cali raised, ghetto slang, you smelling us?
It's boss' life nigga
I put it down like I'm dropping the habit
Smoke an ounce and get up with more bounce than a rabbit
Got to have it like a crack fiend
Counting big face hundreds till my thumbs green
Interested in major money and power moves
Interfere and get em wet up like a shower do
That's how we do
Street sweep you when we ride up on ya
I represent that West Covina, California
Sixty-six hit more licks than a tootsie roll
Give me a mic, a bad bitch, and I'm good to go
Slow flow
Game cold like a eskimo
T.K.O. dawg
I think they better let it go
Lyrical arsenal
I heat it up, I like to flame a mic, {Topic loosen up}
I can't Game, my game to tight
I'm out of sight like Haley's Comet
Throw up my set, boss' life, like I'm sick and vomit
Bow down to the realest, nigga pay your homage
In the city of 600's and mostly Chronic, haha, West
And I'ma stay clutching, busting the trigger
Talk that shit, fuck around and get ride by us [Cali Niggas]

[Verse 7: Eastwood]
Ay, whose back in the 'Lac on white walls
Big body, the same color as Lysol
Hit the block up, if an enemy turn the lights off
And pull up on the fake ass nigga to turn his life off
Block out!, Block out!
Busting, watch the bike fall
I told em about them self-self made niggas, we ain't like y'all
We on some other ish
My goons will smother shit
From my Piru niggas down to them Eastside Crips
I thug like everyday's my last, ask Jesus
He never missed the beat of my heart, and won't neither
A true leader
In the Ferrari two-seater
Slide off to the spot, get bread, and kick my feet up
I'm knocking doors down
When I come around
Better have a nigga cheesey, everybody face down
I represent the city, the home of the Lakers
Inglewood, riding authentic we paper chasing, a Cali Nigga
