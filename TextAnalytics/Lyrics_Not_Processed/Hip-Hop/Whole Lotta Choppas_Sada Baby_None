[Intro]
(
The Coal Cash Collection
)
I'm bool
Bang, bang, bang (
Ayy, yo, Cash, I think we got one
)

[Verse 1]
Ooh, lil' bitch wan' ride it
Told the bitch don't get out her body
Hmm, get right beside me
I'ma get in that thang, get to slidin'
This bitch makin' me feel erotic
Huh, she gotta get on this rocket
I don't give a fuck 'bout her milage
And her grandmom related to the 
Winans
Ooh, that's the shit that I like
You a church girl, bitch, you like Christ
Hmm, you ain't never had pipe
Least not this kind, I'ma fuck you all night
Off a Perc', hmm, off a Perc' pack
Yeah, leave a bitch with the hurt back
Where the work? Hmm, where the work at?
My young niggas wakin' up to serve that

[Chorus]
They wanna see me do my dance
In these thousand-dollar pants
Don't disrespect me and my mans
Bang, whole lotta choppers on your ass

[Verse 2]
Scram, we just put them dollars on your head
Snitchin'-ass nigga gave his mama to the feds
Little brother, big brother, Sada got the dreads
DZ, DT, Sada keep the bands
Lil' bitch can't keep her pussy out my hands
Got a real Hood Rat Suki on my hands
I was stackin' blues, run up Tookies on they ass
I be in the Bay rollin' Cookies on they ass
I be in they nerves, G weed gave me is bustin'
'Cause Sada can't be jealous off weed, I'm never stressin'
I can see the booty from the bottom, that thing come double decker
Let my white boy shoot on that thing, he 
Sam Dekker
Heard you used to chew on that thing, Hannibal Lecter
Have you poppin' all of the pills like Heath Ledger
These drugs ain't a joke, my nigga, I'm just tellin' you
Your manager got you on the shelf and he sellin' you

[Chorus]
They wanna see me do my thang
In these brand-new VV chains
Don't disrespect me and my gang
Bang, t-shirt full of blood stains

[Verse 3]
Mmm, already had dirt on your name
Now your best friend got a t-shirt of your name, dig that
Big body swerve in your lane
AK hit a nigga in the stomach, knock off your six-pack
Like cinema, just hear the click-clack
Now that's end of riff-raff, that's the end of the bullshit
You know I got a full clip
Hmm, walk out and use it
Walked right past your bitch, I had to say, "Excuse me"
Hmm, I thought she was a groupie
Come to find out, bitch pulled up ridin' with a goofy, huh
Hmm, that was you, huh
Huh, you wasn't on that couch, me and Uie
Had bitches in the wop shakin' booty
Had 'em in the parking lot showin' coochie
Had 'em in the bathroom actin' unruly, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
Lil' bitch wan' ride it
Told the bitch don't get out her body
Hmm, get right beside me
I'ma get in that thang, get to slidin'
This bitch makin' me feel erotic
Huh, she gotta get on this rocket
I don't give a fuck 'bout her milage
And her grandmom related to the Winans

[Chorus]
They wanna see me do my dance
In these thousand-dollar pants
Don't disrespect me and my mans
Bang, whole lotta choppers on your ass (Huh)
