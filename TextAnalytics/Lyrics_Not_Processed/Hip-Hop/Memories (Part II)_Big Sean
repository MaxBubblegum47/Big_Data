[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go on and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life’d it
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch?
I’m moonwalking
And my middle name Michael, ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title, ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Motherfuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’ma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cause honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Refrain: John Legend & 
Big Sean

Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
These will be the best memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set til you considered great?
How many missed calls til you considered fake?
How many dreams til it's considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes
You don’t know how that shit feels mentally
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say in memory
I’m praying that he make it, wishing we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those will be the best memories

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Mailed one when I heard Unique had died in that crash
Seems like yesterday I just seen her smile and laugh
I'm stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, light will swallow the dark
Hurtin' with my Mama looking at cribs we can't purchase
Houses bigger than the Palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles, I'm marathoning
To the money and you just running off in a circle
I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner's circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal twenty dollar bill right out her purses
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die first then I have the memories
