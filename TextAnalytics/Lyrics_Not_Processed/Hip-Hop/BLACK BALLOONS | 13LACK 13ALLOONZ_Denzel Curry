[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Twelve'len]
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Inside this paper plane
Note my words are Navy sealed so here and I quote
Taboo and I are in the same boat
What's said from Pennywise, I guess we all float
Sky is the limit, I could die in a minute
Got my mind in a skillet, suicide not a mission
See the vibe very timid, I'm timid and very sad
Translated my thoughts and feelings, I pivot into the pad
Rapers turn to landscapers when they use hoes
Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold
Ice Cube with activator when I'm aggravated
Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated
Two thousand feet, a thousand steps
I let it all sink to one thousand depths
Soon black balloons pop
Let it be the day the pain stop

[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Twelve'len]
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Heaven or Hell, huh, which one prevails, huh?
We gotta go and figure it out
I tried to tell you that this life isn't it
And I just wanna be the rightest I can be
Show my son to think so he can fly as high can be
Always show examples how they kill niggas like me
Thinking as straight as me, but call me crazy
Sun is my attitude, so I'm cool like JAY-Z
Ándale, ándale
, my intelligence for threes
Cancel me like I ain't the King of D.C
Cancel me like I ain't the number one G
Cancel me like you don't like "Dance On Me"
Quickly they forget how you change on all these lies
You flashing all these lights, 
and you savin' these kids lives
And they hate you 'cause you're right, give me hell then, shit
Take your turn to fire and to pitchfork, bitch

[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Twelve'len]
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

[Outro]
Tonight on 102.1, it's 
Denny Cascade
 and the gang in town
Denzel, are you really making an album?
I'm telling you, eventually, they're gonna catch up to your game, you're running out of time!
Someone is really trying to hurt me!
It's not enough is it? It's not enough you had us come out here
In the middle of the night
What exactly are you trying to hide, Mr. Curry?
