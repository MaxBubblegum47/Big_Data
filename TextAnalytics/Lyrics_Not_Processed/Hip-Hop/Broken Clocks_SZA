[Verse 1]
Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a pay check
Runnin' back to the strip club
I'm never goin' back, never goin' back
No you can't make me
Never goin' back, never goin' back (Nah)
They'll never take me
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've heard enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was 10
Love dirty men alike

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Better day than yesterday (Keep cuttin' up)
Ooh oh
I just take it day by day
Ooh oh oh
Never hearing what they say (Uh)
Ooh ooh (Mm)
I just do it my way

[Chorus]
All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love (Still love), still love
It's still love, it's still love
Nothin' but love for you (Nothin' but-)
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but-)
Nothin' but love

[Post-Chorus]
All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talkin’ a lot, sorry I'm faded
(Turnin' up real good tonight)
Think I forgot
(Think I forgot the other night)
You love me, you love me, you love me

[Verse 2]
Got a shift at 10 AM (Yeah)
Gotta dip at 10 PM (Nah)
Gotta get that cash
Won't get past a lunch break
I ain't had a smoke break
In about two days, don't break (Ugh)
Been about three years since I dated you
Why you still talk about me like we together?
I moved on for the better, you moved on to whoever
I was down for whatever, and then some
You gon' make me late to work again

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Better day than yesterday
Ooh
I just take it day by day
Ooh oh oh
Never hearing what they say
Ooh, ooh
I just do it my way (Keep doin’ it)

[Chorus]
All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love, still love (Still love)
It's still love, and it's still love (Still love)
Nothin' but love for you
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but)
Nothin' but love

[Bridge]
I don't eat, can't sleep past 9 AM (Uhh)
Heartbeat make me feel young again (Like a, feel like a…)
Can't beat 'em, just join the party (Let me join the party)
I don't wanna, don't need nobody (Ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talking a lot, sorry I'm faded
Think I've forgot, you love me
You love me, you love me

[Outro]
You love me
You love me
You love me
