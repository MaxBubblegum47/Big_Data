You ain't gotta lie to kick game (Just keep it hundred, keep it hundred)
Me and fake niggas can't hang (No), nah, yo, yeah

[Chorus: C5]
You ain't gotta lie to kick game
Just keep it hundred, keep it hundred
Me and fake niggas can't hang
'Cause you ain't hundred, you ain't hundred
Gotta chase a bag every day
I'm getting hundreds, getting hundreds
Still the same me, nothing changed (Nothing changed, nigga)
'Cause I'm a hundred, I'm a hundred (Yeah, uh)

[Verse: C5]
Keep it hundred, two fifties, you can keep your two pennies
Got me in the friend-zone, but your chick be too friendly (She on me)
'Cause my name hold weight, boy, I'm only one-sixty (Yeah)
Shorties wanna fuck with me, niggas don't want funk with me (Nope)
But how you say you fonking, you ain't getting no money? (Broke)
5 getting cake like I started a GoFundMe (Woo)
Bought my girl a necklace with the show money (I did)
And then I beat that pussy up like she stole from me (Believe that)
But she'll never do that
Boy, I'm wavy, I ain't even gotta wear a durag, they yelling, "Who that?" (Who is that?)
I got the whole combination
And with a clique full of stars like a constellation (Uh-huh)
Pocket full of Franklins, I don't rock with Ronald Reagan (Nah)
And I don't do the pigs either, As-salāmu ʿalaykum (Haha)
Cougars love me, probably in your mama conversations (Ooh)
Keep it hundred with me, you ain't gotta lie or fake it (Uh-huh)

[Chorus: C5 &

You ain't gotta lie to kick game (
RichKidd, nigga
)
Just keep it hundred, keep it hundred (
Keep it hundred
)
Me and fake niggas can't hang
'Cause you ain't hundred, you ain't hundred (
'Cause you ain't hundred, nigga
)
Gotta chase a bag every day (
Hah
)
I'm getting hundreds, getting hundreds
Still the same me, nothing changed (
Hah

'Cause I'm a hundred, I'm a hundred (
RichKidd

[Verse: RichKidd P]
I'm a blue strip nigga, baby, so one hundred
And my shine too bright, they can see when I'm coming
The check, I be running, three-point-five out the onion
Backwood all good, Cookie crumbs in my tummy
Your niggas'll love me, Acorn niggas get money
You ain't gotta lie to kick game, why you fronting?
Niggas say they want beef, I grab the heat out the oven
Chop hold a hundred, treat niggas like Donald, they ducking
And these rookie ass niggas can't, hang we thugging
I be pull niggas 'cards, I can see that they bluffing, ayy
I'm a made nigga, you a maid, nigga
Never been on the farm, but all I do is chase chicken
I'm state to state, nigga, dealer plate mission
Two five a bale, tryna see what I make with it
I fell in love with blue hundreds (Blue hundreds)
Big face blue strips, new money (New money)

[Chorus: C5,

You ain't gotta lie to kick game (
Kick game
)
Just keep it hundred, keep it hundred (
Hah
)
Me and fake niggas can't hang (
Can't hang, nigga
)
'Cause you ain't hundred, you ain't hundred (
You ain't hundred
)
Gotta chase a bag every day (
Every day, nigga
)
I'm getting hundreds, getting hundreds (
Ayy
)
Still the same me, nothing changed (
Nothin' changed, nigga
)
'Cause I'm a hundred, I'm a hundred (
It's LikyBo in this thing, man, look
)

[Verse 3: LikyBo]
They say you change when change come, they must not know about me
Touched a hundred at seventeen and nothing changed about me (Nothin')
Only thing that changed was the names for the ones who came around me (Fuck 'em)
Blew that whole check without a sweat, and I'll say it proudly (Uh-huh)
'Cause money come and money go just like these bitches do
Pillow talk to get the ho, that's what these niggas do
Thirty shots in one load, that's what this stick'll do
I call up the plug like, "Where them drugs? I need a brick or two"
And just 'cause I'm smiling, I'm still violent, and all my niggas too
Once we done firing, you need sirens to come attend to you
You niggas hating each and every way, that's what attention do
But I just look at it like this, they paying attention too, huh
Never worry 'bout no bitch, I'm getting money, getting money
Niggas, niggas talk, but ain't did shit, you niggas funny, niggas funny, uh-huh

[Chorus: C5]
You ain't gotta lie to kick game
Just keep it hundred, keep it hundred
Me and fake niggas can't hang
'Cause you ain't hundred, you ain't hundred
Gotta chase a bag every day
I'm getting hundreds, getting hundreds
Still the same me, nothing changed
'Cause I'm a hundred, I'm a hundred
