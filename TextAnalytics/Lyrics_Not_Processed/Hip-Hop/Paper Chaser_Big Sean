Paper Chaser
Paper Chaser
Yeah
And Whoever's on your grind and got a swag like mine
Say "I'm a paper chaser"
And I'mma keep getting money
'til you haters just love me cuz
I'm a paper chaser

[Verse 1: Jay K]
Yeah and I know she can't say no, all she see is green so she ridin' when I'm sayin' so
And if it's mulla I got handles like a dino
I won't loose control, now why don't you loose control
Chasin' this money i think I'm gonna loose my soul
But fuck it if it move my momma to a better home
Cuz I'm a paper chaser, I like baithin' apea
And even G's get shocked like my watch was a tazer
I am an ultimate warrior with this cheese grater
That means I go hard, chasin' this..

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
GOOD Music, yeah, yeah, BIG
They said it's just not fair, conquer competition
And they could never match my commitment to commission man
I ain't trying to gas you up nigga I ain't ethanol
Bringin' home that bread and bacon
I got high cholesterol, my nigga I get it, what about you
I promised mamma' Benz and a new house too
And man I'm addicted to that good pasta and that cooked lobster
Paper chasin' I'm gon' probably need a foot doctor
LL I'm in love with the label boy
Bitch I'mma dog I wake up and chase the paper boy
But do you niggas really know about paper?
But do you niggas really know about paper?
GOOD Music
