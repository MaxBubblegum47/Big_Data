[Intro: Paul McCartney & George Harrison]

[Verse 1]
Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

[Chorus]
And everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

[Verse 2]
Woke up last night, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door

[Chorus]
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Went out last night, I didn't stay late
Before I got home I had nineteen dates

[Chorus]
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

[Verse 4]
Went out last night, I didn't stay late
Before I got home I had nineteen dates

[Chorus]
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

[Verse 5]
Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

[Chorus]
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
