[Intro: Iggy Azalea & 
Ariana Grande
]
Uh-huh! It's Iggy Iggs!
I got one more problem with you girl, hey!
(
One less, one less problem
)

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya
(
I want you
)
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
(
I want you
)
Tell me, tell me, baby, why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it
(
I want you
)

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

[Chorus: Big Sean & 
Ariana Grande
]
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
I know you're never gonna wake up, I gotta give up
(
But it's you
)
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back
(
But it's you
)
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless, I shouldn't want it
(
But it's you
)

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

[Chorus: Big Sean & 
Ariana Grande
]
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya (
Ooh, babe
)
I got one less problem without ya (
Ooh, woah
)
I got one less, one less problem

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
It's Iggy Iggs!
Uh, what you got?
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
, 
like what

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Mmm, nah, one less, one less problem
Mmm, yeah, one less, one less problem

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

[Chorus: Big Sean, 
Ariana Grande
 & 
Iggy Azalea
]
One less problem without ya (
Babe
)
I got one less problem without ya (
No, babe
)
I got one less problem without ya (
Ooh
)
I got one less, one less problem (Ooh, baby)
One less problem without ya (
Yeah, I got
)
I got one less problem without ya (
Woo, hey!
)
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem, problem, baby
One less problem without ya (
Hey
)
I got one less problem without ya (
Without you
)
I got one less problem without ya (
I got one less, one less, yeah
)
I got one less, one less problem
, yeah
