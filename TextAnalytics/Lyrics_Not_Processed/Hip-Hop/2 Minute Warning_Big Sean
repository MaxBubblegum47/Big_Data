[Intro]
We been together
Over and over again
And the feeling's the same
Can't stay too far
Too far apart
Even if it's just a mile away

[Chorus]
It’s a two minute warning
And I know that you want me
It's a two minute warning
And I know that you're horny
It's a two minute warning
And I know that you want me
It's a two minute warning
And I know that you're horny
It’s a two minute warning

Yeah, yeah...you

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
You gonna make me quit what I'm doing 
And fall through with this bottle
That ain't the only thing you finna swallow
That ain't the only thing I got poppin
That ain't the only thing that's finna spill quick
No rubber shit Ima still hit you
My main bitch and that's real real real shit
Ima treat her like we on vacay, South Beach shit
Only thing you wearing is sheets sets
Talking to you like a little freak bitch
Guess that’s our little secret
When I come through off in my zone
Not that fuckin friend zone
Only thing I touch is that end zone
Look I don't care if it's ten phones
They off
Straight up
You got your legs going way up
When you hop on top and turn around
I can't handle it
I might pass out like a pamphlet
You got a candle lit Cinnamon apple the candle scent
Bed banging like a band in it
You know I can spend all night and camp in it
You know I like to tell you what to do
I micromanage it yeah
Bed so clean, sheets so clean
I turn her over and eat the pussy
Cause she so clean
I'm talking mouth to mouth
I'm talking cheek to cheek
I'm talking waist to waist
I'm talking eye to eye
We know body language
We don't need to speak

[Chorus]
It’s a two minute warning
And I know that you want me
It's a two minute warning
And I know that you're horny
It's a two minute warning

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Your time ain't no one else time
Look, I know you can feel the passion
I know what you want without asking
I know you can feel the heat between us
Close the blinds they don't need to see us
See I get to see a side of you that they don't see or know
You a CEO
You the real, real no GMO
I'm just tryna water you and see it grow
We connect on a soul level
Got you walking all bow-legged
Dont take it out, whoa, whoa, whoa you know better
Got video of you stripping down and getting naked
I throw it down slow it down then speed it faster than the Talladega
Get ya off, turn ya on yeah I’m the only one that activate ya
So good girl I couldn’t one night stand you know i had to date ya
I had to, I had to

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko, K-Ci & JoJo]
If you call me I'll come running
In the daytime I'll come running
In the evening I'll come running
The evening
In the noontime I'll come running

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
It's a two minute warning
And I know that you want me
I know, yeah
It's a two minute warning
And I know that you're horny
It’s a two minute warning

[Outro]
Yeah I love how you're rushing
Ain't no discussion
Quick to flex your muscle
Show me the hustle
Give me that last call
(Last call)
That 9th inning
(9th inning)
That quick quick that 2 minutes we finish
