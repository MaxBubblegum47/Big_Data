[Chorus]
I got lotta city bitches wanna come through (Come through)
I love all my niggas, when I point, they gon' shoot (Gon’ shoot)
I love all my bitches 'cause they love the whole crew
Niggas talk about me, nigga, I'on know you (Yeah)
Pop a nigga like a Molly
Yeah, BAPE, Balmain, on my body
Niggas used to doubt me every day, that’s why I'm cocky
Now I'm gettin' money, now these bitches be around me (Yeah)
I remember school, niggas used to try to clown me (Yeah, oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
I ain't even Spanish but these bitches call me papi
But I ain't waste no time on a treesh (Yeah)
I'm just makin' sure pockets overflowin’, breesh
Shawty said she love me, she gon’ love me on her knees
Like Honcho said, wanna freak, she gotta eat
Mitri, pull up like a dentist, put that metal to your teeth (To ya teeth)
Yeah, I say that (Say that)
Niggas talkin' crazy, I’on play that (I'on play that)
Bitch, I'm MBM and I'on play that (I’on play that)
You know I got a grip, but where's the mace facts (Mace facts)
You know I fucked your bitch, I had to tape that (Tape that)
You talkin' like you wit' it but you ain't that
La di da di da, you mad or nah? (You mad, or nah)
I got model bitches, no pants, no bra (No pants, no bra)
You know I keep a Magnum, ain't talkin' no gun (Ain't talking no gun)
These bitches, they be burnin' for fire, I run (For fire I run)
All my niggas with that, we ain't with the chitchat
If we took your bitch, bro, you can't get your bitch back
Money, yeah, I get that
Shawties, yeah, I flip that
What you tryna do now?
MBM, I did that

[Chorus]
I got lotta city bitches wanna come through (Yeah)
I love all my niggas, when I point, they gon' shoot (Yeah)
I love all my bitches 'cause they love the whole crew (Whole crew)
Niggas talk about me, nigga, I'on know you
Pop a nigga like a Molly
Yeah, BAPE, Balmain on my body
Niggas used to doubt me every day, that's why I'm cocky
Now I'm gettin' money, now these bitches be around me (Yeah)
I remember school, niggas used to try to clown me

[Verse 2]
I told her, "Hop in the right side"
Know that bitch gon' let me fuck when it's the right time
Slap a thot and pass her off, like yeah, that's my dime (My dime)
She like, "Tecca, why you always playin' with my spine?" (Swish)
Bitch, you my thot, you ain't my shorty, it's a fine line (Fine line)
'Cause I had to go and get it (Get it)
All these niggas stating opinions like this is Reddit (Reddit)
She told me that she love me, I said, "Yo, we gotta dead it"
This shit is crazy, thought you was my baby
You asked me if I love you, no, I don't but I said, "Maybe"
I'm glad I played the game because I know you tried to play me
All that lovey-dovey shit, that shit ain't never fazed me (Fazed me)
But I can't fall in love and that's just how my father raised me
I wanna give it up, yeah, I know that shit, it ain't me (Ain't me)
And now I'm livin' happily because I know you hate me (Hate me)
Now I'm livin' happily because I know you hate me

[Chorus]
I got lotta city bitches wanna come through (Come through)
I love all my niggas, when I point, they gon' shoot (Gon' shoot)
I love all my bitches 'cause they love the whole crew (Whole crew)
Niggas talk about me, nigga, I'on know you
Pop a nigga like a Molly
Yeah, BAPE, Balmain on my body
Niggas used to doubt me every day, that's why I'm cocky
Now I'm gettin' money, now these bitches be around me
I remember school, niggas used to try to clown me

[Outro]
Yeah, niggas used to try to clown me
Niggas used to try to clown me (Try to clown me)
Mm, try to clown me (Try to clown me)
