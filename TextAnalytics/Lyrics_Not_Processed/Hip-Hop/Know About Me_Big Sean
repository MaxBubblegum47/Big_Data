[Intro: Future & 
Big Sean
]
Uh huh

She, she said my name, she said my name, she said my name

[Chorus: Future & 
Big Sean
]
Yeah, yeah, my mama know, she know about me
Know about me
My whole hood know about me
Whole hood, they know about me
These bad bitches know about me

All the dopeboys know about me
Oh yeah, they know about me, know about me
Even the dealership, they know about me
They know about me, know about me
Okay, the dealership, they know about me
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve

They know about me, know about me
All the lean men know about me
Know about me, know about me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah-yeah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I got a plate full of tilapia, a crew full of mafia
I look up in the mirror, man, like, "What the fuck is stoppin' ya?"
What the fuck is stoppin' ya?
We been on more stages than the Phantom of the Opera
Lookin' down from the clouds, you can't get a damn drop from us
On the top floor and ain't a damn thing on top of us

[Bridge: Future]
They know, know, know, know
They know, know, know, know
They know about me
They know about me

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I'm swishin' champagne 'round my mouth, yeah
Just to clear my palate, my nigga
Addicted to the mathematics, my nigga
I'm a fuckin' addict, addict, my nigga
If she got a ass, I'll back it
Okay, I'ma fuck around and pay her taxes
Okay, I got Merrill Lynch all on the mattress
Goddamn, I've been ballin', please stop all the hackin', my nigga
Flows on flows on flows on flows, and they just keep stackin'
I cut off all of my distractions and started attacking
I'm droppin' every single summer like Madden
Exhalin' purple weed, now it's purple skies
It's a purple night, Future got me tryin' purple Sprite
Boy you perpin' hard, perpatrating, perpin', oh my god
I done been to war so much I deserve purple hearts
My crew over all
B-I-G, B-I-G, hand on her T-I-T, nut on her E-Y-E
And she gon' let me off everything that I D-I-D
Juugin' every G-I-G
She got very important pussy, I'm swangin' in the V-I-P (swang)
Boy, I'm that nigga, her hand on my zipper while I roll a Z-I-P
I got my crew together, maximizin', blueprint down, we strategizin'
Everything we do is big, so let's start the capitalizin', boy

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Detroit, nigga

PÃ©rignon

That's all I'm drinkin'

[Chorus: Future & 
Big Sean

Yeah, yeah, my mama know, she know about me

Whole hood, they know about me
These bad bitches know about me
They know about me
All the dopeboys know about me
Oh yeah, they know about me, know about me

They know about me, know about me
Okay, the dealership, they know about me
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve
