[Hook 1]
Money being made around here (Around here)

Money being made around, money being made around

Money being made around here (Around here)

Money being made around, money being made around

[Verse 1]
No duh
‘Cause it ain’t nothing funny round here
About all of this money being made around here
So you ain’t getting none unless you running with my peers
And I keep that money coming anywhere that I appear
Get real, I been getting cash money since the juvenile
So niggas gonna feel it more that root canals
Sure, they ball the block like they hoopers now
But to me they translucent, dawg I can’t see them, no
And I’m ahead of them in every way
They front row and I’m center stage
If they cold then I’m Winnipeg
Belligerent
Your bopper running after that bread so long that bitch [?]
Money is continuous, he would of thought I hated cash
‘Cause every time I’m getting it, I’m giving it, spending it
Balling like scrimmages
Getting lost percentages of all of my dividends
I got money nigga

[Hook 2]
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around here (Around here, around here)

Money being made around, money being made around
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around, money being made around

[Verse 2]
This is the young heathen
And I do keep that money coming like it’s semen
So it’s never leaving as long as I’m breathing, believe it
There others temporary like seasons, I’m at the four seasons
My kick game is insane, pockets is on Rick James
I’m rich mane, ain't have to sell crack
I left that rock alone like big Dame
Trying to stay out of them chains like [?]
My ends raise bodies high as astrals, I’m Castro
They putting out shit like assholes
I’m fast forward as Flo-Jo
These homos moving slow-mo as old folks
They love me ‘cause I’m straight up like goal posts
With steady income, and they’s up and down like pogos
Boy, I’m getting money, money, money, like the bank
With money out the ass, I’m pretty sure it stank
Like ew!

[Hook 3]

[Verse 3]
Now if the door’s lifting up, that’s money
If you got your car kitted up, that’s money
Now if a brother on the block, that’s money
Ladies if you baby daddy’s got a job, that’s money
Now if you’re on your own business, that’s money
And if you living independent, that’s money
If you got your own degree, that’s money
And if you got your own CD, that’s money
Yeah listen, I got this
And urban legend like the Lock Ness
I’m controlling this like the cock pit (like what)
I’m out of hand like a mosh pit
So they laying off me kinda like these automotive jobs did
See my apprentice, small as infants
Plotting on me, I can smell it in the air like incense
For instance I’d give you proof like evidence
No questioning and I’m shining like heaven is
