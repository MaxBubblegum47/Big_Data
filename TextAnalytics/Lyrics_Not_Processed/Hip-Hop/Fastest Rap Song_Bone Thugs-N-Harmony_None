I proceed with the murders, servin' off in a coffin
You're fucked, because your niggas

And I'm feelin it, when you feelin' a pain
Well, like I'm insane
And know I can throw the gauge if you complain
There's never another to go with a brother
While smutherin' suckers been goin' undercover
We leave 'em in gutters, ain't going to get caught
But who was the sucka that's squealed on a murder?
Well, 187 The weapon is kept and ya step and get learned a lesson

For punks that run to test
And so punks get ready to drop

And crackin em up with the word of the wise
I be bringin em up in the flow of the funky dialect
I elect a flow for suckers that try a wreck
I spark the light of a head and be wakin em up and then cause a fly effect
I insist ya lay with the path of my rhythm and follow me like a scripture
Flowin this from my lung, a tongue twister
Mista, my style'll be makin a dent and be leavin the tracks bent
Steppin is the lyrical white gent, my english accent
Breakin em up and then makin em take in the smell of my funk I be kickin up in em
And then I'mma give em a lick of my lyrical lollypop, I'm gonna bring em into my doctrine
Rock, then the rhythm'll makin the clock spin blackwards
The funk of the rhythm'll snap, crackle and pop, then flow, oh
I'm makin em follow the path of a God and my track'll be blacker than Cocoa
This lyric I'm makin is dope, don't call it so-so
Don't dis the Tung Twista
Leavin the suckers soft as a whisper, Tung kiss ya like a sister
Then I'mma let it be known that it's the way that I throw
That's makin the funk of the lyrical glow
And how I tell it, yo Cav is kickin a funkedelic flow, and oh, my fist'll
Swing at the rhythm of suckers, then I'm gonna give em a Tung blister

Be makin em hear it and manifest up in him that I'm a star to become
Quick the lyrical style I'mma kick
You better catch the rhythm of it
Cause hip-hop is becomin complicated, never be left hung
Bringin a style like this kinda quick and crisp

From among the tip of my tung
Rock the style of my second verse like that of my first
Be showin the hip-hop hypes my types of flowin, but not the best of T
From an imagination this was took, a mental crook
Stirring this up like a chef or cook
I hear them say give me the recipe
Breakin this off in the fashion of an erection of an adventurous style
That I'mma use to just confuse and smart people then go dumb
You say me style be wack cause y'all can't manifest what I be sayin
Think I'm a lyrical midget, watch me then say fee-fi-fo-fum
