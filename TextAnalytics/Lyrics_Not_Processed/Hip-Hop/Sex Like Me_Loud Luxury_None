[Chorus]
She can't sex like me
She can't be the one to bring you to your knees (Oh, ah)
I made you feel like a king, that's royalty
Shame it took so long for you to see
Too bad baby

She can't sex like me
She can't be the one to bring you to your knees (Oh, ah)
I made you feel like a king, that's royalty
Shame it took so long for you to see
Too bad baby
She can't sex like me

(Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah-nah)
(Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah)
She can't sex like me
(Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah)
(Nah, nah, nah-nah)
(Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah)
She can't sex like me

[Drop]
(She can't sex like me)

[Verse]
I do those things
Make a good girl naughty
Up all night long
At the private party
We were one beneath the sheets, yeah
Fucking and repeating daily
I say goodnight
I'll be alright
Take her home
When you're touching her
I know that it's me you want, yeah
Soon as you're done
I know that you'll
Hit my phone
Like you don't already know
Like you don't already know

[Chorus]
She can't sex like me
She can't be the one to bring you to your knees
I made you feel like a king, that's royalty
Shame it took so long for you to see
Too bad baby
She can't sex like me

She can't be the one to bring you to your knees
I made you feel like a king, that's royalty
Shame it took so long for you to see
Too bad baby
She can't sex like me

[Drop]
(She can't sex like me)
(She can't sex like me)
