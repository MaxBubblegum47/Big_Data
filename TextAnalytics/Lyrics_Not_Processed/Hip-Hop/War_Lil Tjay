[Intro: Pop Smoke]
Traphouse Mob

If I want it, I'ma grab it (Baow)
If I want it, I'ma have it (Woo, woo)
Christian Dior (Christian Dior)
I'm up in all the stores (
This is a Melo beat
)

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
I make a call (Woo, woo)
I make a call and it's war
And, nigga, you can check the score
We up on the board (Woo, woo)
And we all livin' lavish
If I want it, I'ma have it
I make a call (Woo, woo)
I make a call and it's war
And, nigga, you can check the score
We up on the board (Woo, woo)
And we all livin' lavish
If I want it, I'ma have it

[Verse 1: Lil Tjay]
My niggas with it
Money flow, run up them digits
I know niggas mad that we did it
Say it, we live it
Morals, we'll never forget it
I ever get booked, I'm a cricket
Get it and flip it
Henny right here, I'ma sip it
You try me, it's shots at your biscuit
Twenty-four hip it
I'ma just twenty-four hip it 'cause bro said, "Don't ever forget it"
Gang with me
Anywhere I pop out, know the thang with me
Every nigga in here with me gon' bang with me
Try your luck and bro goin' insane with me
Bodies dropping, that shit ain't a thing to me
Smokin' deadies, I'm rollin' up lame niggas
Couple niggas here with me done changed niggas
Clean the mission, we leavin' remains, nigga
Strictly business, ain't playin' no games
Fuck all this fame, nigga
You will get flamed, nigga
Don't you front, I got aim, nigga
I saw homis that fuck with my brain, nigga
I be feelin' like goin' insane, nigga
I just got me a check, now my chain bigger
You gon' die for the stain, nigga
When you sent me the addy, I came, nigga
Only me and my main niggas
You ain't ready for static, don't play, nigga
We could hit you today, nigga
If you makin' your bed, better lay, nigga
There ain't too much to say, nigga

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
I make a call (Woo, woo)
I make a call and it's war
And, nigga, you can check the score
We up on the board (Woo, woo)
And we all livin' lavish
If I want it, I'ma have it
I make a call (Woo, woo)
I make a call and it's war
And, nigga, you can check the score
We up on the board (Woo, woo)
And we all livin' lavish
If I want it, I'ma have it (Look)

[Verse 2: Pop Smoke]
I got thirty shots for any nigga who want it (Facts)
Me and Tjay, we be huntin' (Woo)
I don't talk much 'cause niggas know how we comin' (Bah)
Niggas know I be dumpin' (Grrt)
Glock 9 dumpin' (Dumpin')
Run, Ricky, runnin' (Runnin')
Blue face hundreds (Hundreds)
Know I'm the bill collector (Woo)
Pull up, what's crackin'? Gun get to blastin'
Talk on my name and we wildin' out
All the opps in the spliff, ashin' (Ashin')
Puff, puff, ain't no passin' (Passin')
You gon' end up in a casket (Casket)
'Cause niggas know what we into (That's a fact)
I get to drillin', I'm sittin', I'm killin'
I'm sinnin' if I get the feelin' (You will be dead)
I call Jaguar, bet he clap twos (Woo)
Sip Remy like he Papoose
Have him stay still like a statue (Statue)
Have him inked in like a tattoo
If I run down, he a goner
Headshot, no warnin' (Know we run down, little nigga)
It's a man down when it's pourin' (Now)
Gang spin early morning
I don't get mad, I get money (Facts)
What you lookin' at, little dummy? (What you lookin' at?)
I start buckin' teeth like I'm Bunny (Blah)
And I back the Wraith out for nothin' (Grrt)

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
I make a call (Woo, woo)
I make a call and it's war
And, nigga, you can check the score
We up on the board (Woo, woo)
And we all livin' lavish
If I want it, I'ma have it
I make a call (Woo, woo)
I make a call and it's war
And, nigga, you can check the score
We up on the board (Woo, woo)
And we all livin' lavish
If I want it, I'ma have it
