[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & Swae Lee]
Used to have to eat cold meals (yeah)
Now a nigga offin' gold seals (hey)
Countin' up money, gettin' chills (yeah)
We some young niggas on for real
Tokyo drift through the hills (skrr)
Used to have to walk, no wheels (rr)
Now I'm buyin' whips for the crib (yo)
Young niggas on for real
Hunnid dollar bills
Young, young, young niggas on for real (ayy)
Hunnid dollar bills
Young, young, young niggas on for real (ayy)
Tokyo drift through the hills (yeah)
Used to have to walk, no wheels
Cameras outside my crib (yeah)
Young niggas on for real (ayy)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
I showed them bitches
Better than I ever could've told them bitches
Corduroys and Cartiers
Back then, motherfuckers never shared my vision
But what you riding in, a space ship?
And where your diamonds from, Saudi Arabia?
Oh, you done came up and put your niggas on?
Now you got a crown and a chinchilla on
A1 since day one
We stayed down so we came up
Some of them niggas won't make it with you
They'll lose hope and they'll change up
I can see these niggas hating
But as you can see, the bad bitches love it
They ain't let us in the VIP back then
Now our names on the flyer if we coming

[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
I tried to tell them I was gonna be something
They used to look at me and laugh
All them hoes in the city don't really love you unless you got some cash
That's brand new paint, nigga, don't smudge it
Mu'fuckin pants cost eight somethin'
That's my money so they can't say nothin'
That's my money so they won't say nothin'

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & Swae Lee]
Used to have to eat cold meals (yeah)
Now a nigga offin' gold seals (hey)
Countin' up money, gettin' chills (yeah)
We some young niggas on for real
Tokyo drift through the hills (skrr)
Used to have to walk, no wheels (rr)
Now I'm buyin' whips for the crib (yo)
Young niggas on for real
Hunnid dollar bills
Young, young, young niggas on for real (ayy)
Hunnid dollar bills
Young, young, young niggas on for real (ayy)
Tokyo drift through the hills (yeah)
Used to have to walk, no wheels
Cameras outside my crib (yeah)
Young niggas on for real (ayy)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Young niggas on
Pull up on your ass unannounced in a foreign, I don't know where I'm going
Hit the gas, can I hear the engine running (nope)
Living fast, I ain't thinking about tomorrow (nope)
Used to be a nigga want 20-inch rims
Now we got accountants out here for Rae Sremm
All in the mall, Neiman Marcus shopping
Came a long way from them Ida Street apartments
Everybody got a dream that they chasin'
And everybody got a motherfucking hater
They wanna see your dreams burn to ashes
I can't wait to see their faces when I pass them (skrrr)
Boy, you should taken a young nigga serious
Now a young nigga's on for real
They wasn't fucking with a young nigga then
They can't fuck with a young nigga still

[Pre-Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
I used to tell them I was gonna be something
They used to look at me and laugh
All them hoes in the city don't really love you until you countin' cash
That's brand new paint, nigga no smudges
My mu'fuckin pants cost eight hunnid
That's my money, bitch, you can't say nothin'
That's my money, bitch, you can't have nothin'

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & Swae Lee]
Used to have to eat cold meals (yeah)
Now a nigga offin' gold seals (hey)
Countin' up money, gettin' chills (yeah)
We some young niggas on for real

Used to have to walk, no wheels (rr)
Now I'm buyin' whips for the crib (yo)
Young niggas on for real

Young, young, young niggas on for real (ayy)
Hunnid dollar bills
Young, young, young niggas on for real (ayy)
Tokyo drift through the hills (yeah)
Used to have to walk, no wheels
Cameras outside my crib (yeah)
Young niggas on for real (ayy)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look, moving in slow-mo
But I still get it way faster than you so you never would know though
She slowing it down just to ask for a photo
Just know that I'm fuckin', not maybe, for sure though
Soldiers on me like I'm fresh out the dojo
She think I'm beautiful, chocolate skin, cocoa
Don't get it fucked up, put your ass in a chokehold
Players only live once so I wear Polo
Polo, Polo, Polo, Polo
My girl is from SoCal, my outfit from SoHo
And I got dough, that shit is stashed in the crib
And it won't leave the house like it's fucking DiGiorno
Hell yeah, nigga, that's all me
I'm from where big problems get handled with a small fee
Started with the squad, now I got the whole team tight
Stuck to the plot, stuck to the script, and I don't even screenwrite

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & Swae Lee]
Used to have to eat cold meals (yeah)
Now a nigga offin' gold seals (hey)
Countin' up money, gettin' chills (yeah)
We some young niggas on for real
Tokyo drift through the hills (skrr)
Used to have to walk, no wheels (rr)
Now I'm buyin' whips for the crib (yo)
Young niggas on for real
Hunnid dollar bills
Young, young, young niggas on for real (ayy)
Hunnid dollar bills
Young, young, young niggas on for real (ayy)
Tokyo drift through the hills (yeah)
Used to have to walk, no wheels
Cameras outside my crib (yeah)
Young niggas on for real (ayy)
