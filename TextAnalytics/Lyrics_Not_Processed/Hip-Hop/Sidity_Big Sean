She got pictures of her last man, all in her trash can
She focus just hopeless, you too much like her past and
She in a mind state where her grind rate
Sets her apart from all the live bait
She makes her own dough, she extraordinary
And those hips and thighs you dream about she more than carries
Pills and berries can't describe how she measures up
She’s a dime, that describes why she acting up

[Hook]
She acting all sidity its cause she know she’s bad
She makes her own money, spend it like she never had
Shes way too smart for scheming, she got too much class
