[Chorus: Tanieya Washington]
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
I love my children
God can get another divorce, of course baby
Every Goddamn month, as long as I can floss baby
I can't even rock, I'm grindin' 'bout my business
But I'm takin' the Playstation and I'm kickin' it with bitches
Sippin' on an Apple Martini on granny's porch
Yeah' I called her granny, I was an orphan
And I'm back on my ether grindin', support on my porcelains
Light on the side of this rockin' chair reserved for bosses
Wit' Tip, Black and Milds, we be thinkin', 'no more [?]'
Back wit' Metacalfe, homie up for extortion, nigga

[Chorus: Tanieya Washington]
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone

[Verse 2: Flesh-N-Bone]
When a nigga went away, I contemplated my return
But now I'm back and here to remain and make it burn baby, burn baby
How ya been? Introduce me to your friend, I see her checkin' me out
By my influence steady shinin', yeah
Back on the scene and it ain't another nigga clean
Sharpened my mentality mean bein' king is my demeanor
Finna put these bitches to the test
Rest assured, when its on, they won't be able to measure up to your nigga's Flesh
I got a raw state of mind but that raw state of mind got me on the borderline of doin' crime

[Chorus: Tanieya Washington]
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
I promise, do what I can on my children, smokin' weed
She got stitches in her face, take a piss like Mami B, I'm heated
You'll never see it, that's just the way I G it
Down in Cleveland wit' my niggas, no more kids wit' raggedy bitches, hey!
One hunnid carats, lets kill the city like Biggie did
Hell yeah I share it with any nigga I kick it with
E'ry nigga in the hood, I protect Pac better than Suge
Puffy is better wit' Big, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony stood
Mo' Thug is all for the bud, they think Kray killed Rock
Naw, he Jehovah witness spittin' on your wicked blocks

[Outro: Tanieya Washington]
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
