[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
Baby, I'm not even in a gown
I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch
The way you want me makes me want you now
The only thing you have to say is (Wow)

[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
And I feel this way with no chemicals
In my system, babe, it's incredible
When you're touching me, yeah, that says it all
You said it all (Yeah)

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
Baby, I'm not even in a gown
I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch
The way you want me makes me want you now
The only thing you have to say is (Wow)

[Post-Chorus: Zara Larsson]
Make your jaw drop-drop
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion (Oh)
Make your jaw drop-drop
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion
Make your jaw drop-drop
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion (Never, never, never)

[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]
In a crowded place, can you just imagine?
It's unparalleled, the way it all just happened
If you can't have me, you don't want no one
You don't want no one (Mmm)
I got all my friends asking what it's like
To be loved like this, to be recognized
Behind the scenes, made me vulnerable
You make me so vulnerable, oh

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter & Zara Larsson]
Baby, I'm not even in a gown
I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch
The way you want me makes me want you now (Want you now)
The only thing you have to say is (Wow)

[Post-Chorus: Zara Larsson, Sabrina Carpenter & Both]
Make your jaw drop-drop
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion, oh
Make your jaw drop-drop
Say, "Oh my," drop-drop-drop (Make you say, "Oh my god")
Make you say, "Oh my god" (Make you say, "Oh my god")
My, drop-drop (Make you say, "Oh my god")
Make your jaw drop
Make you say, "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion

[Outro: Zara Larsson & Sabrina Carpenter]
Never, never, never, oh
Never, never, never, oh
Never, never, never, oh
Never, never, never, oh
