[Intro]
No way, Hozay

[Chorus]
I might just K.O., the Perc' up in my Faygo
Run up on me wrong, turn his head into a bagel
On the opposition block, just like a Lego
I'm big homie, bitch, so you know that I got say-so

[Interlude]
What you say?
Yeah, man, know what the fuck goin' on
NLE Choppa, nigga (Bitch)
Shotta Flow 3 (Yeah)
Nigga can get beat (Yeah), I don't fuck with the police (Fuck 12, bitch, bitch)
Fuck he talkin' 'bout? (Yeah)
What I say? (Crip)
Ayy (Crip), yeah (Crip), yeah (Crip), yeah

[Verse]
Every show that I do, bitch, you know that I rock it (Huh?)
The mic in my hand, but the Glock in my pocket (Bitch)
These niggas keep dissin', I guess I'm the topic
These bullets gon' knock the knowledge out his noggin
It's Shotta Flow 3 and you know I'm a G
Beatin' my case, I ain't coppin' no pleas
You say you a gangster, you say you a stepper
But you cooperated with police (On God)
Step back up then shoot my thunder
You ain't no boss, lil' nigga, you a runner (Yeah)
This bitch suckin' my dick like a flavored cucumber (Ayy)
Dick all in her throat, I was touchin' her tonsils (Yeah)
Hit from the back, I was pullin' her hair and I ripped off her frontal (Yeah)
I'm pullin' his card, that nigga a bitch
I ride for my nigga like Morty and Rick (Yeah)
Can't step out the house unless I got my blick (That Glock)
You can get your ass shot like I'm takin' a pic'
My nigga Piru but I'm banging the C (The Crip)
If you coming for me, you get put on a tee
If you fucking with me, you gon' sow what you reap
I'll throw me some shots out the Glock 23
Ayy, I want all the green like I was a leaf
My gang in the party, we came for peace (Shotta)
Put chops on a opp so his ass got beat
He got his ass jumped by a hundred some feet (Bitch)
My niggas, they steppin', I call them some troopers
You was shootin' at me, but you missed, you a blooper
And when I shot back, bitch, I hit, I'm a shooter
Big titties on a chopper like I'm working at Hooters
I'm on some boss shit, and I'm on some gang shit, you can get your ass stepped on
She calling me racist, she was dark skinned, but I want a redbone
Put his name on this bullet, the trigger I pull it, you better order a headstone (Brrrr)
And now that boy head gone
Bitch nigga, you a snitch
My niggas they vicious, bitch, I am a menace
And let's have a shootout like I'm in a scrimmage
Got dope in the lab like I was a chemist
Shot him in the teeth, they call me a dentist
Walk down on my opp, I ain't leavin' no witness
Shoot a hundred some shots, I won't stop 'til it finish
I break in your house like I came through the chimney
And I'm high as a bitch 'cause the Perc' in my Henny
Two .40's on my waist like I'm rocking some Fendi
Bitch, I'm making shit shake like I'm doin' the shimmy
And she got a fat ass, but that bitch really skinny
And she suckin' my dick, she in love with my Jimmy John (Yeah, bitch)
You talkin' 'bout bodies, I got me a ton (Ho)
And I'll get a nigga whacked while I'm kickin' cack
Smokin' on a pack and eating a honey bun

[Chorus]
I might just K.O., the Perc' up in my Faygo (Faygo)
Run up on me wrong, turn his head into a bagel (A bagel)
On the opposition block just like a Lego (A Lego)
I'm big homie, bitch, so you know that I got say-so, yeah

[Outro]
Shotta shit, no politics
We shoot like StojakoviÄ‡
Shotta Flow 3
Get your ass beat
Bitch, I'm Grape Street
Yeah, I'm a Crip, but I'll wipe a nigga nose
Fuck is you sayin'?
Clatt
(
Your ass retarded
Ayy, that was so bomb that I started dancin' in this ho
Girl, that ho so bomb, I started dancin' on my adlibs)
