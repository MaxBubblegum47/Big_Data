[Verse 1]
She orders up another one
'Cause who's counting anyway
Won't stop till the job is done
She's gotta forget his name
Every sip on her lips is going down so slow
Like the tears falling off her face
Bartender knows better than to cut her off
It's his job to fix heartbreak
She don't even like the taste

[Chorus]
But she's throwin' them back
Raising the glass
Saying goodbye to the past 'cause it's over
Clearing her mind two at a time
Little more vodka with a little less soda
Knows it ain't right, just for tonight
It's gonna be her way of dealing
She has mixed feelings about her drinking
Mixed drinks about her feelings

[Verse 2]
Every time her phone lights up
She pretends she doesn't see
'Cause she don't even need to look
She knows who's on the screen
They say drunken minds fix a sober heart
When it's torn apart 'cause it went too far
Lord knows she must be hurting
'Cause she hasn't said a word

[Chorus]
But she's throwin' them back
Raising the glass
Saying goodbye to the past 'cause it's over
Clearing her mind two at a time
Little more vodka with a little less soda
Knows it ain't right, just for tonight
It's gonna be her way of dealing
She has mixed feelings about her drinking
Mixed drinks about her feelings, yeah

[Bridge]
She don't even like the taste
But she won't let it go to waste

[Chorus]
Yeah, she's throwin' them back
Raising the glass
Saying goodbye to the past 'cause it's over
Clearing her mind two at a time
Little more vodka with a little less soda
Knows it ain't right, just for tonight
It's gonna be her way of dealing
She has mixed feelings about her drinking
Mixed drinks about her feelings

(What's a couple mixed drinks?)
(A couple mixed drinks?)
(What's a couple mixed drinks?)
(A couple mixed drinks?)

[Outro]
I know what you want
(A couple mixed drinks)
I know what you need
(What's a couple mixed drinks?)
I could finish your problem right now
(Yeah, a couple mixed drinks)
Let me buy you a drink
(What's a couple mixed drinks?)
Let me buy you a drink
(Yeah, a couple mixed drinks)
Let me buy you a drink
(What's a couple mixed drinks?)
I could finish your problem
(Yeah, a couple mixed drinks)
I can make you forget him
(What's a couple mixed drinks?)
