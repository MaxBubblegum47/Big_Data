[Verse 1]
I wanna know how we became so distant, girl (Oh)
The way we fell in love, it was almost instant (Oh, girl)
I'm tryna find a way around it (Oh, girl)
Girl, tell me how you feel about it (Oh, girl)
You still love me, that's the way it's sounding (Oh, thank God)
Thank God, I would've never found this, I doubt it
I'm there for you if you allow it (If you allow it)
Girl, you know I gotta keep you around me (You around me)
All this paper we counting, blazing these ounces
Spending on you, baby, no matter what the amount is
Now you wanna know what's gotten into me, what's changed? (Changed, Young Tiller)
I guess I had a hard time showing it at first, but

[Chorus]
Baby, it's been that way (Ayy, oh yeah)
Baby, it's been that way (Ayy, oh, ayy, oh)
Baby, I still feel the same (I still feel the same)
Something I gotta maintain (Something I gotta maintain)
Listen to me when I say (Listen to me when I say)
Baby, it's always, always
Always been that way (Uh huh, huh)
It's always been that way (Ayy, didn't I tell you, girl?)
It's always been that way
Baby, I still feel the same (I still feel the same)
Something I gotta maintain (Something I gotta maintain)
Listen to me when I say (Listen to me when I say)
It's always been that way (Listen)

[Verse 2]
How did we become so distant? (So distant)
Like I'm the one to blame and you're innocent
I tried to make a way, make a difference, but (Yeah)
Some things don't change, I can't complain (Oh)
I try not to think about you
What can I say? Every time I get near you
I want that old thing back
, now bring it to me
Shawty keep telling me what to do about you (You)
Think she got jealous soon as she knew about you (You)
She don't ever wanna see her go through round two (Cut her off)
Cut her off, that's what I'm doing now, you
Told me I should go out and do my thing (Damn right)
Damn right, I do my thing (Yeah, okay)
Now you wanna know what's got into me, what's changed (Oh yeah)
But, baby, nothin' changed

[Chorus]
Baby, it's been that way (Yeah, ayy, and you know, oh yeah)
Baby, it's been that way (Ayy, uh, and you know, oh)
Baby, I still feel the same (I still feel the same)
Something I gotta maintain (I gotta maintain)
Listen to me when I say (Listen to me when I say)
Baby, it's always, always (One time, girl, sing it one time)
Always been that way (Ayy, girl, sing it one time)
It's always been that way (Ayy, didn't I tell you, girl? Sing it one time)
It's always been that way (Ayy, yes sir)
Baby, I still feel the same (Ayy, till feel the same)
Something I gotta maintain (Yes sir, yes sir)
Listen to me when I say (Listen to me when I say)
It's always been that way

[Outro]
Oh yeah, ayy
It's always been that way
Oh yeah
It's always been that way (Been that way)
Yeah, uh huh, yeah
In the trap, in the soul
In the trap
