[Hook: Krayzie Bone] [x2]
I say the war shouldn't stop until they get down
Body rocc (body rocc, body rocc)
We say the war shouldn't stop until they get down
Body rocc (body rocc, body rocc)

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
We paper-chasers, smoke blunts
You'll never find a thuggish bunch of ruggish like us
Don't be so quick to test us
I'll be annoyed, and might bust
I'mma have to talk to Eazy through the Ouija
So I can see if maybe he can tell me why you hatin' on me
Bitin' on me, why you want me
To have to show you Leatherface
And he'll cut you down quicker
He's a real buck-'em-down, getcha
We be just rappin' but I'm down to scuff 'em, I don't hit cha
Playas put your checks from your ladies, get high
Then the ladies sneak your keys from the playas and ride
Everybody wanna party, even the haters with a problem
Hey, we done solve 'em, and quick, we'll squash 'em
Don't know me, eff you, when you got beef
But you also got to clone styles and no motif
See me rappin' on your TV, actin'
And it's a fact that when you see us in person
Think we won't flex or show you no action
Down for mine, got to show a busta time to time
So I figure I'll slow down the rhyme
So they can understand I'm filled with so much anger and pain
And if I drop, then I'll explode like an army grenade in ya
We ain't calm, time to ring the alarm
Break the killers outta prison, splittin' all the guards (Whoo)
Power to the people, givin' people the power to put it down in your city
Mo be rollin' with me, feel me?
I can't stand no dirty crooked po-po
When will we get at 'em, revenge 'em, they takin' no mo'
Mo' Thug the only clique that I claim
Although we are beyond the bangin'
You can say I roll with a gang
And dissin' chin-checkers in the makin'
You hear me, continue with the rotation

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
I heard, I murdered
I heard, I murdered, I heard (heard)
Yeah nigga, we holler about all of the murders
Look what they did to Tyrone
Flippin the flow and let it burn
Without pistols, the police ain't strong
Finna bomb, bitch, you fuckin wit all the black gat peeps
And in the 1999 when ya meet up in the end
Be it be no peace for the police
The (Biz) here to rip the (streets)
And get 'em all (pissed)
Get [?]
We don't take (defeat)
Me steppin' (retreat)
You can lose yo arms, better use yo feet
Jus pick up my cannon, nigga, yeah yeah
Hear the pump, it erupt
We're corrupt as the four, down to buck
Come and get fucked up
And get up outta the county, nigga get rowdy
(duck into battle)
Disappear-pear, in a ally
Reappear-pear, off in Cali
Can you feel me, daddy?
Proudly handle stuff like a man
And went through shit in Cleveland
With the band
Now look at me platinum
Fuck the rap, and corner bitch made hation nation
Nowadays an occupation
So why you hate me? Still can't fade me away
Go on, be gone
The point of view was made with the song
And while they pop, I'm ready to bomb
(bomb, bomb, bomb)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
How do you see me when you see me?
Drinkin' on Hennessy and Remy
Look in my eyes, they always dreamy
Movin' the body as you toss it up
I buck, the gauge erupt, disrupt your order
Infantry, y'all better expect annihilation
Come around this SCT
I'm a soldier, organize up
But they're lovin' just us
Army see, full of harmony, so baby in thugs keep trust
You know we bust, so back up off me
Givin' no mercy, keepin' it physical
Lettin' the instrumental go as I break through a spiritual
Diggin' a ditch, all you po-po
Who felt you could come and raid
Ain't no way be to safe
It's the army brigade
So, listen up, and hear what's spoken
As I start this locomotion, retaliation
Because we chosen, showin' the Lord devotion
(Yeah)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
Now when your messin' with me
Make sure you know what you're doin'
Got playas that know what they doin' rollin' with me
Infrared to your head, don't beg, you said
We fled, gotta get away, gotta make sure I'm free
So when you need me I can buck another day
It's a Bone thang, better ride, ride
Cause what you're messin' with, you can die-die
Don't be surprised, Bone want your presidents
Wanna run it all, run all, all
Buck that dog, dog, I'm crazy, superstitious
Don't pull no gun if you ain't gon' spit
Click-clack-clack be the sound
These police and haters is wrong (oh)
We buckin' 'em down
Trust in me in harmony, I try peace
Eternally bless my soul, Lord, and everybody that rides with me
It's from me to you
It's from me to you (me to you)
It's just our point of view
It's just our point of view (point of view, point of view)
Yeah, and that's why I stay right
So right, so right
Had me feelin' like lodi-da-da-da
Lodi-da-da-da, da-da, da-da
