[Chorus]
You too fake I can’t fuck with you niggas
Can’t fuck with you too fake
On the block I ain’t make it to dinner
In the trap I got my own plate
Leave it wet like a tub when I’m in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that’s what made me a winner
You too fake I can’t fuck with you niggas
Can’t fuck with you too fake
On the block I ain’t make it to dinner
In the trap I got my own plate
Leave it wet like a tub when I’m in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that’s what made me a winner

[Bridge]
If I call you my bro then your bitch is untouchable nigga, I ain’t touching her nigga
You past me that chop I ain’t bluffing I’m busting a nigga, I’m busting a nigga, look

[Verse 1]
I’m addicted to choppers and long nights, devil on sight
Said he don’t want me living the long life, but he wrong right
I know niggas be mad as shit, we gon’ run up a bag, split it in half
Can’t fuck up no packages, you shot my cousin bring no bandages
You left me hanging wasn’t mad you switched
And that was the saddest
They got the federally tryna ask me shit
I get low and I’m passing
Got it now situation got the back and grips
Throwing bullets like Madden we hit a touchdown on your block it’s lit
Did him dirty for capping, no we don’t care what you jacking
You in a wrong move that’s a classic
Came with a long clip everlasting
Marry money I’m in love with the cashing
Blue hundreds think I find them attractive

[Chorus]
You too fake I can’t fuck with you niggas
Can’t fuck with you too fake
On the block I ain’t make it to dinner
In the trap I got my own plate
Leave it wet like a tub when I’m in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that’s what made me a winner
You too fake I can’t fuck with you niggas
Can’t fuck with you too fake
On the block I ain’t make it to dinner
In the trap I got my own plate
Leave it wet like a tub when I’m in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that’s what made me a winner

[Bridge]
If I call you my bro then your bitch is untouchable nigga, I ain’t touching her nigga
You past me that chop I ain’t bluffing I’m bussing a nigga, I’m busting a nigga, look

[Verse 2]
I heard they want me dead that’s a myth money on my head come and get back
I’m flipping double grams that’s a lick tryna get a 100 band every trip
All up in the cut son like a stitch, kill what they ain’t doing shit
Don’t depend on no man no bitch, bro keep a suntan when it’s brick
But bitch I’m in love with the money, gotta know I’m in love the money
She a treesh she gone come for the money but I could bet you she can’t get nothing from me
And I can stretch you get you wrapped like a mummy, hit that whip you gone crash like a dummy
Disrespect I just laugh at you it’s funny, they know it’s something my shooters making it ugly

[Chorus]
You too fake I can’t fuck with you niggas
Can’t fuck with you too fake
On the block I ain’t make it to dinner
In the trap I got my own plate
Leave it wet like a tub when I’m in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that’s what made me a winner
You too fake I can’t fuck with you niggas
Can’t fuck with you too fake
On the block I ain’t make it to dinner
In the trap I got my own plate
Leave it wet like a tub when I’m in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that’s what made me a winner

[Bridge]
If I call you my bro then your bitch is untouchable nigga, I ain’t touching her nigga
You past me that chop I ain’t bluffing I’m bussing a nigga, I’m busting a nigga, look
