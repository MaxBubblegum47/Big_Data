[Verse 1]
Give me the cash, fuck a wedding ring
Put some ice on my neck, cash money watch it bling, bling
Always talkin' 'bout the block hot
But you want a bad bitch in Givenchy socks?
Make the pieces hit or nigga Milly rock
Time up, yeah game over, shot clock
If you ain't got that bread you ain't got a shot
'Cause I'm that bitch, yeah real hot

[Verse 2]
It's Yung Miami and I don't play with niggas
Bitches got jealous cause my pussy real glitter
Pussy nigga come correct, you better have figures
Dropped five racks and my titties got bigger
All y'all hoes be so fake
I been in the game, y'all hoes late (Tardy)
Got your baby daddy beggin' me to eat the cake
JT on the track, we ain't come to play, take off

[Verse 3]
I stay hot and ready like Lil Caesars
I need a nigga who gon' swipe them Visas
Don't breathe on my neck, my back
If you ain't gonna cut that check
If he breakin' bread you better fuck with that nigga
But if he don't you better cut that nigga
Always in my DM's, say I'm stuck up
But when I ask you for something, you say you fucked up, hell nah

[Interlude]
You be talkin' all that fly shit
But you ain't really 'bout shit
I'm a fly bitch, she a free bitch
That's the difference
And all you broke, bum, crusty ass hoes
Move over

[Verse 4]
He want to fuck with a raw bitch
Pretty face, white teeth, not average
I need four-five M's like Savage
He want my ten, I need his new digits off his plastic
Take me to Louis, spend racks
Here bitch, this your man, get him back
Thought he was gettin' some of this cat
Ain't shit sweet, I ain't having that

[Verse 5]
You want a freak, pussy pink like bubblegum
But talk is cheap, fuck nigga this ain't free lunch
Keep it up, have them real niggas fuck you up
Keep my own money case a lame nigga try to cuff
Showin' off your watch, your ring
Pussy niggas spend your change
Showin' off your watch, your ring
Fuck niggas spend that change

[Verse 6]
Cough it up, nigga show me what you 'bout
I'm the baddest lil' bitch in the south
Pussy wetter than Miami in a drought
After you bust a check you can give a lil' mouth
It's about that time, gotta chase that check
G on swole, Snapchat my flex
Lil baby got bands so he might be next
Might take your nigga just to spend his check

[Verse 7]
Lil nigga gotta spend that shit
Can't fuck me, boy, won't slang no dick
You ain't got no chips, she ain't got no whips
Say you want a lil' baby, well I ain't that bitch
'Cause you broke, and I need that check
I be up in club Liv, you be posted in the Lex'
Say you want a lil' time, well I need a lil' neck
Say he love me all the time, I don't even read the text
