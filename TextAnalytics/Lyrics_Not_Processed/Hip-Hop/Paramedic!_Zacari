[Intro: Zacari & Kendrick Lamar]
I am Killmonger
No one's perfect
But no one's worthless
We ain't deservin' of everything Heaven and Earth is
But word is, good, (This is my home)
Said no one's perfect, but no ones worth this
We ain't deservin' of everything heaven and Earth is
But word is, good (Northern California)

[Verse 1: Slimmy B & Kendrick Lamar]
Ayy, they better call a paramedic in the street
I got leverage in the street
I'm a California nigga and I'm heavy in the streets
.22 or .23, I'm heavy with the heat
Hit you with this chop, paramedics can't save you (Can't save you)
Really in the field c'mon bro, I know that ain't you (No, it ain't you)
2018, hell naw, I ain't gon fade you
Gon' paint you, TDE and SOB, we can't lose
Niggas bitch made
That's just somethin' I can't relate to (Can't relate to)
Turn on the gang
That's just somethin' that I can't do (No, I can't do)
Fall out over a bitch
That's just somethin' that I can't do (No, I can't do)
Rip every beat I get on, I was made to (I was made to)
This Glock get to growlin', somethin' like a black panther
Tryna touch a mil, fuck sayin "get yo bands up"
Fuckin' with the gang, yeah, I had to man up
One fist in the air, I ain't finna put my hands up (Gang!)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a bitch would
I wish a bitch would, I wish a bitch would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would

[Verse 2: Lul G & Kendrick Lamar]
Got shooters tappin' in, nigga for them bands, nigga
West Coast niggas; yeah, they blowin' fans, nigga
I know I'm the man, baby, bring your friends with you
Puttin' points up while you in the stands, nigga
But I be stuck in these streets, you in the background
Ever since they took my brother, gotta pack rounds
Sorry momma, two bails, took a bad route
I done got my bands up, a nigga stacked now
But we been still O.T. on that bullshit (On that bullshit)
I don't wanna have to do it, empty full clips (Empty full clips)
Why these niggas talkin' robbin', they don't do shit
High Cali niggas tapped in, we'll cook shit
Bust down on my neck, niggas reach, gettin' stretched
Rockin' with this TEC, niggas better wear a vest
Last year, I was broke, young nigga in the Crest
Now a show 20 or better, broke niggas keep the rest

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a bitch would
I wish a bitch would, I wish a bitch would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would (DaBoii)

[Verse 3: DaBoii & Kendrick Lamar]
California nigga and I'm heavy in these streets
If you don't keep a pole how you ready when it's beef
(If you don't keep a pole)
Lil nigga think he cut, yeah, I bet the nigga freeze
If that nigga want me dead, I can't let that nigga breathe
Want me gone, sent a shot, like the real kind
These niggas actin' like they tough when they real kind
Thumbin' through a 100 racks just to kill time
They got a nigga at the edge, but I feel fine
But it come with this shit, I'm okay with it
If your man's to his last share a plate wit' 'em
One whole wood to the neck, it's an eighth in it
New baby chop, let it sing, it's a Drake nigga
A lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
Why it's hard for me to smile? 'Cause I seen a lot
You ain't really in the field, you just tweet a lot
If we ain't on the same page, you can kick a rock, bitch!

[Verse 4: Yhung T.O. & Kendrick Lamar]
And I been really tryna keep the peace
But I'm a north Vallejo nigga, and I'm heavy in the streets
I was raised by my granny and the gangsters
So at eight I made the choice I'ma forever be a G, and
I don't really like to talk
I remember we was broke and I don't really like to walk, nigga
Now I ride around in foreign cars
And I put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga
I don't play games, stitch lip, I don't say names
She want a dog, I'm a Great Dane
I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain
My momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
They ain't wanna see me win 'cause I'm black
So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back
If you need someone to call, I'm the man for the task
You ain't standin' for the cause, meet the man in the mask
