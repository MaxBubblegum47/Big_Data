[Intro]
Run mayne, run mayne
Cause here we come mayne
Run mayne, run mayne
Run mayne, run mayne
Cause here we come mayne

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Put the rope around my throat like chemical warfare
Remember the prison?
Invisible, critical drinking, critical thinking, hell yeah
Where the clique of sneakin' demons lookin' out
Peakin' out, speakin' out, leanin' out
See you later
Evade the haters, Glocks if you wait us
Remember the flipping 'em, minimum haters
Change the subject
For the public we gon' chain gang
Screaming that thuggish shit
And bang, bang, bang
How do we maintain to change the same thing
Nigga you do my mainframe, main pain
We are, original thugs
My criminals gun mayne, guns aim
Some say Satan, he run thangs

[Hook: Bizzy Bone]
Run mayne, run mayne
Cause here we come mayne
Run mayne, run mayne
Cause here we come mayne

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Crept up outta the cut
And nigga you know this hit the scene like a deadly explosive
Mo' money was the ultimate motive
That's why we be stormin' on niggas that locus
Wrote this tomb for a nigga singin'
Promised you doom, and I'mma bring it
Addicted to having this paper, this paper, and I'm still fiendin'
And I mean it
Ain't no way these motherfuckers ever gon' stop the boss
Bringin' in new millennium holocaust 'til the weed gon fall off
And that's the real, see this the truth
Nigga better go and lace his boots, be ready to die
If not, your family gon' perish, whatchu gon' do?
Ask me? Nigga, shit
I'm takin' a ball, buckin'
Cause if a nigga disrespect you
Let 'em know you representin' something
It could be your hood, nigga, your babies
Wish, Bizzy, Flesh, or Krayzie
And I represent all of the above for the Lord up above
And nigga, I fucked you fo' one of my souljahs
Its '99, game over nigga

[Hook x2]
