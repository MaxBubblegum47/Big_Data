[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Baby girl, I think we need to sit and talk, talk, talk
Playin' with my money, paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock
Blowin' up my heart then stick a pen and pop, pop, pop
Either you stupid or don’t know what you got, got, got

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
I could be wrong, you could be right
You'll probably be alone, I'm probably not
Well listen, girl, you acting like an idiot-ot-ot
Really tryna love you but it's getting hard, hard, hard

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is you crazy? Did you lose it?
Are you stupid? Are you foolish?
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don’t take rocket science to understand it
You paper, scissors, rock my world, girl, am I the one you playing?
You paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
You throw it away, throw it away, th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away

[Verse 2: Timbaland, with Chris Brown]
Well I can take you back to the spot where you was bought, bought, bought
Make 'em return my paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock
Maybe you can think about the shit and stop, stop, stop
Climb up on this boat and show me how you drop, drop, drop

[Pre-Chorus:  Timbaland & Chris Brown]
I could be wrong, you could be right
You'll probably be alone, I'm probably not
Well listen, girl, you acting like an idiot
Really tryna love you but it's getting hard, hard, hard

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Big Sean]
I-I-Is you crazy? Did you lose it?
A-A-Are you stupid? Are you foolish?
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don’t take rocket science to understand it
You paper, scissors, rock my world, girl, am I the one you playing?
You paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
You throw it away, throw it away, th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
(B.I.G, boing, Sean Don, nigga)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay, whoa there (Whoa there), whoa there (Whoa there)
Is your noodle? Cock-a-doodle?
Are you crazy, crazy, crazy?
Did you knock a couple screws loose?
I-I-I know what time it is (Why?), only 'cause you cuckoo
I got bitches jumpin' for me like a bouquet by the beaucoup (Boing, boing, boing)
Are you tryna leave? Oh, you trippin', tie your shoe lace (You lil' bitch)
You’s a dime bitch 'cause you two-faced (Two-faced)
And you gave me heads and tails (Hahaha)
Throw it at me, baby (Baby), I be the wishin' well (Yeah)
For real though, I know our shit's not perfect
We connected then need space, swear our love is written in cursive
Put that rock up on your finger (Finger), paper in your hands (Hands)
But you can’t cut me out (Out), bitch, this ain't no game

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Big Sean]
I-I-Is you crazy? Did you lose it? (Boing, boing)
A-A-Are you stupid? Are you foolish? (You crazy)
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don’t take rocket science to understand it
You paper, scissors, rock my world, girl, am I the one you playing? (Oh, oh)
You paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
You throw it away, throw it away, th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
