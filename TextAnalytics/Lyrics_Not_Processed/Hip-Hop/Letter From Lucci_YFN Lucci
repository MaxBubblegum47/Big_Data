(Part 2 - Don't Know Where I'd be ft. Rich Homie Quan)

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan & YFN Lucci]
If it wasn't for them late nights, hustling on the block, tryna get it up, I don't even know where I'd be
If it wasn't for that 15 months, that I spent locked up
Nigga I don't even know where I'd be
If it wasn't for the last 24 months I spent with Nut nigga
I don't even know where I'd be
Yea, If it wasn't for the sacrifices I knew my momma took nigga
I don't even know where I'd be
If it wasn't for momma or daddy, I swear that
I don't even know where I'd be
If it wasn't for the commas I was stacking
I swear to God I don't even know where I'd be
If it wasn't for the rollie I'd prolly waste time
Prolly thinks life's blinding Cartiers on my eyes
My money for sweetie yea I spent like nine
Everyday me and Lucci thank God
'Cause I don't know where I would be

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
I don't know where I would be
Without my family
And I don't give a fuck about how much money you got
Dont handle me
Guess what I make a nigga answer me
Broke nigga took that hoe to Applebee's
All my suits tailored like the pastor speak
Versace everything like Master P
Pull up on my niggas in the hood
Then I, smoke a couple blunts and then book
A lil' rolly a watch its red like a bull
I fucked that lil hoe 3 days in a row
I can tell that pussy scared cause she show it
Funny how all my exes want to know what I'm doing
I put lil shawty to bed, got tired of hearing her moaning
Watching out for the feds, riding around with nothing on me
She wanted to watch me rap, turn on the movie Mummy
She kept the lights on, while she was doing it to me
All I know is real boys, see me and they know me
I swear I don't know where I'd be without my homies
Shoutout Lucci, shoutout YFN
Shoutout Rich Homie, boy no new friends
I don't know what I'd be without them East Atlanta corners

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan & YFN Lucci]
If it wasn't for them late nights, hustling on the block, tryna get it up, I don't even know where I'd be

My money for sweetie yea I spent like nine
Everyday me and Lucci thank God
'Cause I don't know where I would be

[Verse 2: YFN Lucci]
Uh, I thank God we was chosen
They say never question God and I know it
But why Big, nigga Big had kids
See Big one of the reasons a nigga big
Big had a heart this big
Big was my nigga 'til the end
Big taught me how to put it up and don't spend
Big always told me to transcend
He told me get the front end and the back end
Then he told me most niggas pretend
And that's why I don't have friends
Just some brothers who gone ride to the end
.45 on my side to the end
Nigga we don't hide, nigga you know where we is
Look where I'm going, nigga look where I been, yeah
Nigga you know what it is
Late night hustling, tryna get my shit right, no pen
Every single day, and night I sin
But Lord forgive me I'm human yeah, yea, yea
Face card good, like I'm playing poker nigga, face card good
And nigga when you see me better get it understood
And me and Quan good, nigga me and Quan good, tell 'em
