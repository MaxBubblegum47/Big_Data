[Chorus: Krayzie]
Playa playa playa (hate me, hate me)
Playa playa playa (Fuck 'em  we don't care)

[Krayzie]
Playa hation has begun to rise, and it's contagious pray
Betta not let it get you man, hata hata haters
Haters hatin this song this song, and if I had a wish
I would teach the world to be a thug in harmony (perfect harmony)
Gathered souls get up (get up) and let us move on (move on)
Maybe some could follow if their hearts were not so cold towards Bone
Come and venture through the family scriptures…
Flip thru every page and you’ll find true niggas like no other kind, kind, and I’m..sick of mutha fuckas tryna see the thuggish ruggish so i went and bought a black mossberg pump pump for you
Tell me what do ya see, slim nigga in a mask
I'm mad & finna blast that
Do you know what it means, to just leave us leave us leave us alone
You know we put you in the, no phony ways pretenders
You know we put you in the, no phony ways pretenders

[Layzie]
Nigga won't be fuckin wit no haters in the 9-7
And all the way to heavens that's my mission
Standin up ready for the war in position
When the shit jump niggas won't be slippin
Niggas fallin victim, really what's happenin
I'm a victim just cuz I'm rappin
Stackin my cheese that I'm always packin
Niggas with nothing to loose be cappin
And I really blame you muthafuckas it's true
What goes around comes around, since I did what I did
In the past, get a pipe and a chance and I'm ready to throw down
Low down, dirty muthafuckin shame, in a world so cruel
It's niggas like you, who just be disrespectin the game
Before I had a little money, niggas what's hatin me jealous
4 nothin, breakin my gear and thinkin it's funny
Get around bitches and niggas be frontin, but I'm hustlin
Strugglin, jugglin, wit a lot of frustrations
Livin in a nation of playa hation, wit a fucked up situation
I'm facin' yea y'all playa hatazzzzz

[Wish]
Haters dry your eyes (eyes eyes) , and hold on (hold on)
Cuz we're ballin' (ballin ballin') y'all
We gon keep it going strong (oh!) ohhhh!!
We be really thuggish ruggish, you can love us you can hate us
We can deal with you but! It be niggas comin round,playa hatin & sayin they ain't, man! them the worst ones, you know like, tell yo bitch on you on the low
Spit something in your car all the time with a nigga always talkin
About he coulda done some betta than you don already did it, just hatin
You know and I know you, we see all y'all, playa haters, fuck y'all
Playa haters, fuck y'all, don't you hate on me, don't you hate on me
(I put the beam on you muthafuckas)
(I said I'll put the beam on you muthafuckas)
Dont you (if you spent) hate on me (mo time)
Dont you hate (concentrating on your own shit) on me
Don't you (then playa hatin on mine) hate on me dont

Hate on, hate on, hate on, hate on, hate on, hate on, (umm!)

[Chorus: Krayzie]
Playa playa playa (hate me, hate me)
Playa playa playa (Fuck 'em  we don't care)
Playa playa playa (hate me, hate me)
Playa playa playa (Fuck 'em  we don't care)

[Bizzy]
Nigga, there's far more pictures of the scriptures
Missed 'em cause they're despicable, but
Bitch I'm makin' millions off my physical residuals
Traditional, but mystical, where were you at when pistols blow?
And what about welfare and health care?
Well, I guess that missed you, ho
And I guess you watch my brains tissues
And if there be broke-asses knowin' for the moment
Noticed you 'fraid, cause yous are fools... fools

[Chorus: Krayzie]
Playa hata (hata, hata), we know very well
Playa hata (hata, hata) who you are (are)
Playa hata (hata, hata), don't let 'em smoke your weed
Playa hata (hata, hata), or ride in your car (your car)
Playa hata (hata, hata), playa hata (hata, hata)
