[Verse 1]
Tears, money, honey on my bread
Sugar on my pillow, songs in my head
Head to the church, I love to repent
Say what I mean when it's not what I meant
Oh, I wanna lie in bed on Monday
Wearing a diamond studded hat
I live a good life, a full life, do it all again
Love one man forever, who's a thousand man

[Chorus]
I want what I want, I want it now
I feel what I feel, don't bring me down
I know what I know, I don't know how
But I want what I want, I want it now

[Verse 2]
I wanna to lead, follow, wallow in the mud
Do it for my Daddy, do it for God
And God knows, am I getting it wrong?
But who the hell cares when you're gettin' it on
Oh, I want something to believe in
When it all comes crashing down
Remake the world, no pain or violence
Turn up the volume, 'til there's total silence

[Chorus]
I want what I want, I want it now
I feel what I feel, don't bring me down
I know what I know, I don't know how
I want what I want, I want it now

[Bridge]
I wanna dance in the rain with a lover who drives me wild
I throw my hair in my face when I wanna act like a child
I don't know why, I, I dont know why, I
I want what I want

[Pre-Chorus]
Do it for my Daddy, do it for God
God knows, am I getting it wrong?
But who the hell cares

[Chorus]
I want what I want, I want it now
I feel what I feel, don't bring me down
I know what I know, I don't know how
I want what I want, I want it now

[Outro]
I want what I want
