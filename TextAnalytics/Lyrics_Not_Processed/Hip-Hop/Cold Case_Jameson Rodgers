[Verse 1]
A 24-pack of them Rocky Mountain mile-highs sittin' on ice
A bunch of bottle caps are scattered on the porch
Gonna have a few more 'fore that sun comes around
There's nothing else I can do
Sit right here and try to figure out
What the hell I'ma do

[Chorus]
No tire marks peeling out of the drive
No goodbye, no salty heart-broke tears
No fingerprints on a slamming door
No evidence you were ever here
You disappeared without a trace
So I'm drinking beer, working on a cold case

[Verse 2]
I've tried going out
I've tried to find you in a bar
And your car ain't parked at your mama's house
You ain't picking up the phone and your friends don't know
Or they're just telling lies
Covering up for you
I'm here at the scene of the crime
But still ain't got a clue

[Chorus]
No tire marks peeling out of the drive
No goodbye, no salty heart-broke tears
No fingerprints on a slamming door
No evidence you were ever here
You disappeared without a trace
So I'm drinking beer, working on a cold case

[Bridge]
'Till I know why you left
Or 'till you come back I guess
It's gonna be a cold case

[Chorus]
No tire marks peeling out of the drive
No goodbye, no salty heart-broke tears
No fingerprints on a slamming door
No evidence you were ever here
You disappeared without a trace
So I'm drinking beer, working on a cold case
Yeah I'm working on a cold case
