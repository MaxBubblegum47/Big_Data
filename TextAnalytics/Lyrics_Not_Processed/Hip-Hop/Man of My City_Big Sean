[Chorus: K CAMP &

Hah, bitch, I'm the man in my city

I see how they play and I get it
I don't say much but she with it (
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
)
Young, wild, and free 'til I'm finished

[Bridge: Travis Scott & 
French Montana

Down all the drugs you can handle (Woo, yeah)
Blow up the holes in the roof
Light up the sky like a candle (
Han

Flashing lights out of the blue

Hah, bitch, I'm the man in my city (

[Verse 1: French Montana & 
Travis Scott

Shaking that dice and I gamble

Pass me the rock I got handle (

Money never fold up
Pull up in that Bimmer
Nigga buy the whole lot
Now I'm drinking lean
Yeah we smoking weed and baby we don't mean it
When we pull up in the boat, Titanic, La Marina, god damn!
When I hit it from the back and do the toe wop (
Straight up!

Cutting up the dope and keep the door locked
I be getting to this money baby, no lie
Ask me no questions, I won't tell you no lie (Woop!)

Smoking I be drinking brain gone no ceiling here (Han!)
Pull up in that drop, no ceiling here (Skrrt)
Ask my last bitch she's a millionaire

Straight up!

[Verse 2: Big Sean & 
Travis Scott
]
If you talking reckless, I check it
She sent a text, I ain't check it, I'm sorry
The head ain't even worth the headache
Focused on the mathematics no electives
The man of my city like I got elected
I run through the city like that bitch a finish line
Power, respect, yeah, I like â€˜em both intertwined
Text from my momma, all it say is, "Get it, Sean"
Okay, I got it, yeah, I made some fucked up decisions
Fuck a double cup, I want double commission
Streets feel my shit like a head-on collision
Your girl in my whip, making head-on decisions
My ex could write a book, a tell-all edition
It'd be a best seller, make enough to take care of her, her best friends and the rest of her children
'Cause even some good girls got super head in them
 (
Straight up!
)

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Down all the drugs you can handle (Woo, yeah)
Blow up the holes in the roof
Light up the sky like a candle
Flashing lights out of the blue

Hah, bitch, I'm the man in my city (
Bitch, I'm the man in my city

Young, wild, and free 'til I'm finished (
Yeah, young, wild, and free 'til I'm finished

Bitch, I'm the man in my city
I see how they play and I get it (
Straight up!
