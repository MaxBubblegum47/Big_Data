[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down
'Cause this feels better to me
Than anybody reality
I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless
Flying on a cocaine spaceship
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

[Verse 1: Tyla Yaweh]
I don't know what I took
All I know is that I'm hooked
Twenty-four hours got me seeing blue dragons
Molly and the Henny got me speaking different language
Thinking 'bout the world now my mind, no tragic
Thinking 'bout the world now my mind, no tragic

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down
'Cause this feels better to me
Than anybody reality
I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless
Flying on a cocaine spaceship
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I board a private plane, that's the only flight I've ever known
I roll up to the face, sometimes I don't share, I smoke alone
Khalifa, man, rollin' them pounds up
And one day, I'm smokin' the ounce up
In the 'Burgh, we smoke the best, KK smoke all in my chest
I don't go on missions, I don't ask permission
I keep it at my crib, come smoke some pack with Wiz
Some fools be sober but I'm higher than a eagle is
And I ain't worried 'bout the police, 'cause it's legal, bitch
And it's so strong that you can smell it when I'm passin' through
And if I can't smoke, then these edibles will have to do

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh & Wiz Khalifa]
Girl, I'm so high right now (Hahaha, yup)
I don't think that I'll ever come down (KK only though)
'Cause this feels better to me (You know it's paper planes, we don't do no Backwoods or none of that shit)
Than anybody reality (No)
I'm floating in the air like I'm weightless (Look, it's Taylor Gang)
Flying on a cocaine spaceship (And y'all know I'm high as fuck)
Girl, I'm so high right now
I don't think that I'll ever come down

[Outro: Tyla Yaweh]
Yeah, I don't think I'll ever come down
Yeah, I don't think I'll ever come down, yeah
Yeah, I don't think I'll ever come down
I don't think I'll ever come down
