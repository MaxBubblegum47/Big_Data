[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
They try to take that from me
Want blood, they want me
They want blood, they want me
They want blood, they want me

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Bankroll, couldn't even fold, couldn't stay afloat
Bank broke, now I got way too many bank codes
Fake hoes, and my day rose, walk around my spare room
Lamb zoom, [?] zoom, sailor moon, silver spoon
But I ain't no oil tycoon
And if I'm gone 'til November
Won't see my ass 'til next June
And it's true, and they broad day-time afternoon
Tryna spoil my mood, I'm tryna enjoy my cartoons, bitch

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood & 
A$AP Rocky
]
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (
Bankroll
)
Every time you at the party it's a scene (
Bankroll
)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (
Bankroll
)
Sunken place, always coming in your dreams
(
Bankroll
)
