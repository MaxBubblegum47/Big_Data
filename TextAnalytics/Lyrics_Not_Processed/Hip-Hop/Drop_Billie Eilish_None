[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Baby, I'm nervous about you, I can’t help myself
No, I'm no good
You're making me a liar, oh no, baby, don’t start up a fire
This isn't good, no
So bad

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Oh no, baby, don't drop from your soul
This can't be, honey, I wish you would stop trying to make me worried
I'm getting embarrassed my people laughing at me
No, no, no, no, come on, self, be myself

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
Don't let me go on falling, this can't be
I'm so worried, my heart is in Havana
Half of my heart is broke
My hometown is full of embarrassing people who make fun of me
Yeah, baby, careful

[Chorus: Camila Cabello + (SAINt JHN)]
Oh no, baby, don’t drop from your soul
This can’t be, honey, I wish you would stop trying to make me worried
I'm getting embarrassed my people laughing at me (Yo)
No, no, no, no, come on, self, be myself (uh)

[Verse 3: SAINt JHN]
Yeah, I got the roses, they turned the table (Uh, Camila)
Everybody laughing at me, especially my friends
I don’t care how I'm dressed
I don't gotta where proper clothes, yo!

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Oh no, baby, don't drop from your soul
This can’t be, honey, I wish you would stop trying to make me worried
I'm getting embarrassed my people laughing at me
No, no, no, no, come on, self, be myself
