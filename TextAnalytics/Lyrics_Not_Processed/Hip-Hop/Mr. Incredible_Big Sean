[Intro: Earlly MacMillion]
Incredible, incredible
Incredible, incredible
The story of my life be the makings of a real boy
If you live my life you will recognize a real boy
If you didn't know I'mma have to let you know
And I just wanna be incredible
Incredbile, incredible, Mr. Incredible

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I hear the people yellin, so it's time to get my save on
Bet that I could do in one day without a cape on
All I needs my Nikes, chain and my Bathing Ape on
And bet that I could clean this mess up without an apron
With no hesitation, got so much drive
All I need is four wheels and I'mma reach my destination
From where they on that cane like they need a hip replacement
Got on and got out, I even made a bitch replacement
Now she gon ride my dick til I need a dick replacement
Mr. Incredible, she still in amazement
Underground money safe in a dark basement
And I flash more than Powerpoint presentations
But with great power comes great responsiblity
The ones who don't cheer for me is trying to get rid of me
Im trying to make history, they trying to make me history
So I'mma see which one is really meant for me
The story of my life

[Hook: Earlly MacMillion]
The story of my life be the makings of a real boy
If you live my life you will recognize a real boy
If you didn't know I'mma have to let you know
And I just wanna be incredible
Incredbile, incredible, Mr. Incredible

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
And I check my highlights every time the news is on
Still stand out if we wore the same uniform
And my chick is finer than them models, but only five four-a
Idolize Kimora and in love with my aura
But love seems to be every hero's downfall
So even if she treats like me a king, there's no crown for her
Bitch recognize this power in my punchlines
See me as a meal ticket, but I'm not a lunch line
Crying for my help, but I can't fit them in my schedule
Put me on a pedastal, but if I lost it all
Some would flip like they was flexible, fake ass niggas man
Swear to God, eat a dick and everything that's edible
And I can't save everything and all
I would need the world's biggest memory card
When I die and my grave says in memory of
I hope somebody else will rise above and become incredible

[Hook: Earlly MacMillion]
The story of my life be the makings of a real boy
If you live my life you will recognize a real boy
If you didn't know I'mma have to let you know
And I just wanna be incredible
Incredbile, incredible, Mr. Incredible
