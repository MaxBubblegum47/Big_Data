[Chorus]
Ballin' (ballin'), I'm just doin' me but she keeps callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road, to riches, I got bosses with me (bosses)
I'm gon' be ballin' (ballin'), I'm just doin' me but she keep callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road, the riches, I got bosses with me (uh)
Flawless with me

[Verse 1]
I'm gon' be cool now
I don't go to school now
I got shit to do now
I see different views now
I can't have you using me, using me, using
I got bitches choosin' me, choosin' me, choosin
Back in forth I've been flying yeah I been going hard
Pay that bill for my brother because he fight the charge
When it get cold in the winter I wear that Gucci scarf
We comin' straight from that bottom, I got my battle scars

[Chorus]
Ballin' (ballin'), I'm just doin' me but she keeps callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road, to riches, I got bosses with me (bosses)
I'm gon' be ballin' (ballin'), I'm just doin' me but she keep callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road, the riches, I got bosses with me (uh)
Flawless with me

[Verse 2]
I'm gon be rich, I'm gon be rich
I took the risk, I didn't miss
We notice this, I notice this
I'm gon be big, I never switched
I'll never quit, I'm too legit
You burned your bridge, but I'm gone be lit
The perfect win, ball out the rim
Switch on me I can't forget, I need a vent
Only get on life to live, I'm on my shit
Bought my school some Harden kicks, we ball like this

[Chorus]
Ballin' (ballin'), I'm just doin' me but she keeps callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road, to riches, I got bosses with me (bosses)
I'm gon' be ballin' (ballin'), I'm just doin' me but she keep callin' (callin')
Can't go back to you 'cause I got options for me (options for me)
On the road, the riches, I got bosses with me (uh)
Flawless with me

[Outra]
I'm gone be ballin'
