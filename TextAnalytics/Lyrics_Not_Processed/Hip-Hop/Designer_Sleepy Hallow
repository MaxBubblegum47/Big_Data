[Intro]
Great John on the beat by the way
Shooter, shooter, that shooter gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Move it, move it gang
Shooter, shooter, that shooter gang
Gang, gang, gang

[Chorus: Sleepy Hallow]
You wanna drip in designer
I'm with some shit that's way more finer
Lookin' for me I'm higher
I'm with the gang, that's way more choppers
Clip full of them piranhas
Bullets buying you ain't make it to mama
Shoot a gang with the drama
Fuck it up and then we split commas

[Verse 1: Sheff G]
I be focused on the [?]
Niggas really cannot compete with me
Short used to come flex a lot and now she wanna meet the D
Run up the G's with me, but please don't run up, you can meet the piece
Shoot up this beef with me, so please don't come unless it's peace with me
Call my brothers that come ridin' with me
Everybody sendin' [?]
Couples [?] I'm fine without them, they'd rather be with me
Shorty move to here, she got a nigga, but she'd rather be with me
No, she'd rather be with me, no she'd rather be with the G
Love will show you [?] love it when she don't bring no panties (nope)
She know I keep it [?], niggas steady watchin' they don't understand me
Shorty in love with the gang
[?] my shooters come in handy, uh
No I ain't playin' them games, hit the pressure breaker with the family
No I ain't sayin' no names, niggas tellin' we just keep it manly
You remember
You the one playin' them games and shorty you shoulda never
I know they remember
They gonna remember our name forever, we do it better
Long as they remember
Long as they remember our name forever
We do it better

[Chorus: Sleepy Hallow]
You wanna drip in designer
I'm with some shit that's way more finer
Lookin' for me I'm higher
I'm with the gang, that's way more choppers
Clip full of them piranhas
Bullets buying you ain't make it to mama
Shoot a gang with the drama
Fuck it up and then we split commas
You wanna drip in designer
I'm with some shit that's way more finer
Lookin' for me I'm higher
I'm with the gang, that's way more choppers
Clip full of them piranhas
Bullets buying you ain't make it to mama
Shoot a gang with the drama
Fuck it up and then we split commas

[Verse 2: Sleepy Hallow]
Fuck it up then we splittin' them commas
Shit, lit, be honest, you don't really wanna make this a problem
Shoot, shit, count hundreds
Money comin' I can see it I want it
Take my brothers on a trip to Bahamas
Remember nights we used to trap out the Honda
We had some up and downs like a llama
We made you hot like a sauna
[?] and shit
All of them feelings we handling it, a couple nights [?]
Oh you wanna drip in designer?
Is you with the gang, gang, gang, gang?
Throw up your symbols and problems
'Cause we on the same thing, same thing

[Chorus: Sleepy Hallow]
You wanna drip in designer
I'm with some shit that's way more finer
Lookin' for me I'm higher
I'm with the gang, that's way more choppers
Clip full of them piranhas
Bullets buying you ain't make it to mama
Shoot a gang with the drama
Fuck it up and then we split commas
You wanna drip in designer
I'm with some shit that's way more finer
Lookin' for me I'm higher
I'm with the gang, that's way more choppers
Clip full of them piranhas
Bullets buying you ain't make it to mama
Shoot a gang with the drama
Fuck it up and then we split commas

[Outro: Sleepy Hallow & Sheff G]
Fuck it up then we splittin' them commas
Shit, lit, be honest
Fuck it up then we splittin' them commas
Shit, lit, be honest
Fuck it up then we splittin' them commas
Shit, lit, be honest
Fuck it up then we splittin' them commas
Shit, lit, be honest

Move it, move it gang
Shooter, shooter, that's shooter gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang
