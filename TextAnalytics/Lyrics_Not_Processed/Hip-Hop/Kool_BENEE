[Verse 1]
You're so well-spoken, have control when
You walk into the room, you show them
You're outside smokin', your skin is glowin'
You're like an angel, out of this world
I love your confidence you strike
I wanna dip into your life
You float around without a care
I love your steeze and what you wear

[Pre-Chorus]
And I stay at home most of the time
You're so badass, owning the night
So badass

[Chorus]
Fuck, I wish I could be like you (I really do)
Fuck, I wish I could be cool like you (Cool like you)
I say stupid stuff (Yeah, yeah)
And embarrass myself ('Cause I'm dumb)
I'm not very cool (Yeah)
It sucks, I suck, I want to be like you (You're cool)
I say stupid stuff (Stupid stuff)
And I embarrass myself (Yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
C-cool, c-cool, cool
C-cool, c-cool, cool
Cool like you
C-cool, c-cool, cool
C-cool, c-cool, cool

[Verse 2]
I'm mesmerised by what you say
But you don't know that I exist
People can't keep themselves away
Like they're under some kind of spell

[Pre-Chorus]
And I stay at home most of the time
You're so badass, owning the night
So badass

[Chorus]
Fuck, I wish I could be like you (I really do)
Fuck, I wish I could be cool like you (Cool like you)
I say stupid stuff (Yeah, yeah)
And embarrass myself ('Cause I'm dumb)
I'm not very cool (Yeah)
It sucks, I suck, I want to be like you (You're cool)
I say stupid stuff (Stupid stuff)
And I embarrass myself (Yeah, yeah)
