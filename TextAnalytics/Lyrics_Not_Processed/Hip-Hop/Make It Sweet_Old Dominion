[Verse 1]
I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul-sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

[Verse 2]
Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

[Bridge]
Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight
Baby ain't that right, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet
Life is short, make it sweet
Oh yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
