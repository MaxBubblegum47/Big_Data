[Verse 1]
Bubbles in the bath tub
Laughing to a honey scrub
Bee sting on my bit-bit
Blah-blah-blah
Smile like a baby
Talk just like a lady
Coconut, buttercup
Honey cream daily

[Pre-Chorus]
Sugar got me crazy
Water got me high
Don't have time to be shady
You know why
You know why
You know why

[Chorus]
I'm the crazy daughter
From the sweet, sweet mother
And the wild father
Got some funny sisters
We make sugar water
We make sugar
I'm the crazy daughter
From the sweet, sweet mother
And the wild father
Got some funny sisters
We make sugar water
Sugar

[Verse 2]
Froggy, dewy mist smears
Drips down glass like cold tears
Soak and release my fears
Drowning in this damn day
Hell was looking my way
Buckle up, buttercup
Ice cream day

[Chorus]
I'm the crazy daughter
From the sweet, sweet mother
And the wild father
Got some funny sisters
We make sugar water
We make sugar
I'm the crazy daughter
From the sweet, sweet mother
And the wild father
Got some funny sisters
We make sugar water
We make sugar

[Bridge]
(Do we have anything that works?)
That wasn't going my way
But who cares?
A day is gone, you've got to move on

[Outro]
Lively lies and loose ends untied
I won't let that define my life
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
