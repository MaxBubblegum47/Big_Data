[Chorus]
I just need a break from Dallas
I just need a break from Dallas, Texas
I just need a break from Dallas, oh
I just need a Break from Dallas, Texas

[Verse 1]
Play with my heart
Like the strings on a guitar
I'm going far
When you catch me, I'll be on Mars
'Cause I'm a superstar shining
You know I'm outlandish
Ooh, I know you can't stand it
I'm gonna stunt on you
So you can be like, "I should have never curved you", mm, mm
I'm gonna front on you
I'm crazy, crazy in love with you
Brazy, Brazy in love, in love

[Chorus]
I just need a break from Dallas
I just need a break from Dallas, Texas
I just need a break from Dallas, oh
I just need a Break from Dallas, Texas

[Verse 2]
Block me from your phone, I'm still loving you
Blocked on everything, what I'm 'posed to do?
Got my friends lurking on your page, yeah, I'm stalking you
You're still my bae and you know that, boo
Shorty from the east side
Bad bitch mad thick
Shorty got good vibes
But she's tragic
And she's toxic, making me nauseous
Dallas, Texas, making me off it, off it

[Chorus]
I just need a break from Dallas
I just need a break from Dallas, Texas
I just need a break from Dallas, oh
I just need a Break from Dallas, Texas

[Outro]
I just need a Break from Dallas, Texas
