[Intro]
Uh
Yeah (Ayy, Royce, you did it right here), yeah

[Chorus]
I was broke, now a young nigga flexed up
In the foreign switchin' lanes, you can't catch up
You was hatin', but you switched up 'cause I'm next up
I got lean and some 40 in my red cup
Bitches changed and act like I ain't noticed
Gettin' money, nigga, that's my main focus
With .223 and you act like you don't know this
Bro popped a bean, me and my niggas always rollin'

[Verse 1]
Your ho tweaking
Me and KK Wok, we always geekin' (Always geekin')
Leakin', yeah, my fours leave your body leaking (Boom, boom)
I be road runnin' every season (Every season)
And I just count up bands, my neck is freezin', ayy (Count up bands)
Me, JD, linked with South End, we was thuggin' (We was thuggin')
Outside totin' rachets, holdin' on the work, we runnin' (Hold on work)
Now we counting bands, yeah, my niggas always thumbin' (Always thumbin')
And we don't give a fuck 'cause my niggas always drummin'
I was watching, steady plottin', pistol totin' (Pistol totin')
Mixin' beans with my lean, that shit had me floating (Mixin' beans)
I was broke, now I'm eating, stomach feelin' bloated (Feelin' bloated)
I been showed you how to flex, young nigga wrote it (How to flex)

[Chorus]
I was broke, now a young nigga flexed up
In the foreign switchin' lanes, you can't catch up
You was hatin', but you switched up 'cause I'm next up
I got lean and some 40 in my red cup
Bitches changed and act like I ain't noticed
Gettin' money, nigga, that's my main focus
With .223 and you act like you don't know this
Bro popped a bean, me and my niggas always rollin'

[Verse 2]
I was just a young nigga waitin' (Nigga waitin')
But now we up, no worries, gettin' faded (Faded)
Playin', swear these bitches, they always playin' (Always playin')
Sayin', I could give a fuck 'bout what you sayin' (Give a fuck)
Grew up 50th Avenue, tweakers laid up next to dude
Need a bigger revenue, so I stayed tryna sell to you
Niggas always testin' me, so I stay with that 32 (With a 32)
You can't roll with bros and me, 'cause we gon' blast that 22 (Brrah)
Yeah, you knew, I said you knew it (Yeah)
I turn heads when I roll through, yeah
You know I'm with the, with the crew, yeah
Circle small, so it's just two times two, yeah

[Chorus]
I was broke, now a young nigga flexed up
In the foreign switchin' lanes, you can't catch up
You was hatin', but you switched up 'cause I'm next up
I got lean and some 40 in my red cup
Bitches changed and act like I ain't noticed
Gettin' money, nigga, that's my main focus
With .223 and you act like you don't know this
Bro popped a bean, me and my niggas always rollin'
