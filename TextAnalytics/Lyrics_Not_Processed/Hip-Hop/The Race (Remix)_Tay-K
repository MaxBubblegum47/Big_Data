[Intro: Tay-K &

I-I-I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action (

You want action, you get turned into past tense (Into past)
Your boys deep? Well, let's get to subtractin'
Smith & Wesson made my .9 with subcompaction (Skrrt)

[Chorus: Tay-K]
Fuck-Fuck-Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case (Gang, gang)
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (Skrrt, skrrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face (Lil bitch)
Eli Blast crackin' fours like a vase (Gang)
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (Skrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob-Rob-Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace (Give me that shit)
We tryna see a hunnid bands in our face

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat her face (21)
Put it in your mouth, ahh, how it taste? (Lil bitch)
Backend, nigga, that's a 100K (On God)
Four shows, nigga, I can buy a Wraith (Skrrt, skrrt)
My street cred platinum, ain't nothin' fake (21)
Pulled up to the Slut Walk with a K (Bitch)
You a internet gangster, I'm a ape (21)
Young Savage, Zone 6, EA (On God)
Hundred round drum hangin' off the Drac' (Pew-pew-pew)

You want the drama? We got the drama

Whole lotta guns, whole lotta choppers
Whole lotta smoke for them (Whole lotta smoke for them)
Whole lotta motherfuckin' yellow tape
You don't wanna smoke with them (You don't wanna smoke with them)
