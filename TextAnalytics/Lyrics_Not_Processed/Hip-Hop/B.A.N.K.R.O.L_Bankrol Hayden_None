[Hook]
Head on narcotics, drip like a faucet
Hoes be so toxic, ayy (Bitch yuh)
Money the topic, free all my goblins
Chill, looking panicky, got problems ayy
Fell off with them like the leaves the autumn
To the top, not the bottom
Fake friends, I don't know, I forgot 'em
She beg for nuts and I hit 'em with 
got'em
 ayy
B.A.N.K.R.O.L
Love no bitches, L.O.L
My shit hit like NFL
Where I'm from, it's win or fail

[Verse 1]
Bitch I got good luck like I'm Charlie
Fuck school, I'm going tardy
I ain't wearing Abercrombie
Shawty go stupid no blondie yuh
She going nuts like it's M&Ms
I ain't the same like a synonym
Wetty bowl for nutrition in
Count it up like a dishin' did

[Verse 2]
I said I'm gunnin', I'm serious
She call me George and I left her ass curious
Shout out to God, I don't fuck with no pyramids
Haters gon' hate and they all on their periods
My brothers is reckless, they act I be heavy
They left me alone and my friends with some flakers
They ain't hold it down like a boat with a anchor
I'm gone for 6 months now they askin' for favors
