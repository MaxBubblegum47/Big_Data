Lately been on that fuck a nigga shit (Fuck a nigga shit)
Take a nigga bitch and then I pass her to the clique (Pass her to the clique, nigga)

Fuck a bitch and then I put it in a bitch throat (Bitch throat)
Never give a bitch yo phone, that's a no-no (Hell nah)

Loaded up, still bouncin' with that .44 (Huh)
Fuck a bitch and then I put it in a bitch throat (Bitch throat)
Never give a bitch yo phone, that's a no-no (Hell nah)
Off tops, new chain and my wrist froze (Huh)

Get popped quick 'cause them niggas that you rock with (Rock with)
