[Intro: Andr√© 3000]
Shoot through your car door
Shout out to Cardo
Cardo got wings

[Chorus: Quavo & Travis Scott]
If that coupe came with rims, I don't want it (Skrrt)
Stock me out (Ooh, yeah), big block me out (Ooh, yeah)
Robocops, they out (Ayy), put my guns in the house (12)
So much cash over this way (Cash), no, no droughts
Too much of alcohol, we need more options
Need more dancers, oh, we way too poppin'
In love with ice and chains, I'm way too flashy
We movin' fast as hell, no, they can't catch me

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Fill that pot with my arm, put that on my mom (Skrrt, skrrt)
Walk around with two drums, call that Under Arm (Baow)
Put that coca on her tongue, bet it get numb (Coco)
Nawfside, H-Town, nigga, where you from? (Where?)
Ayy, where you from?
Ayy, where you from?
Yeah, where you from?
Ayy, where you from?

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Freaks got me geeked, yeah
Energy, suck it outta me, yeah
Hit my phone, click, then I'm home
Styrofoam, zone, zone zone zone
Get a brick, get a band, okay
We let it blow the same way
See this life when you make this wave
Du-rag life, shit laid
Poker face, in and out my place
When you play that high stakes
Wild, just like my style
When you roll that loud, can't hear you now

[Chorus: Quavo & Travis Scott]
If that coupe came with rims, I don't want it (Skrrt)
Stock me out (Ooh, yeah), big block me out (Ooh, yeah)
Robocops, they out (Ayy), put my guns in the house (12)
So much cash over this way (Cash), no, no droughts
Too much of alcohol, we need more options
Need more dancers, oh, we way too poppin'
In love with ice and chains, I'm way too flashy
We movin' fast as hell, no, they can't catch me

[Verse 2: Quavo]
(Quavo)
We movin' too fast (Too fast)
The coupe got drag (Coupe got drag)
America's most wanted (Who?)
Huncho and Jack (Huncho and Jack, yeah)
I just left the jeweler, now my diamonds dancin' (Dance)
She takin' all this cocaine, call her Marilyn Manson (Coco)
Got the .5 on the waist
Walk in the buildin', fire in the place (Fire)
Every time I buy a brand new piece
I buy a brand new K (Yeah)
Turned myself into a young beast
Yeah I remember this day (Beasty, beasty)
I remember this day (Hey)
Ice piece, no blades (Ice)
Double Cs my shades (Chanel)
We the stars and we famous (Stars)
Don't get involved with the gangstas (No)
Don't get involved with the bangas (No)
'Cause I got stripes like a Bengal (Stripes)
I'ma need every single (Yeah)
Stack it up like Pringles (Tall)

[Bridge: Quavo]
Stack it tall, make it look like magic (Ye)
What it look like?
If that coupe came with rims then you can have it
Yeah, yeah, ye

[Chorus: Quavo & Travis Scott]
If that coupe came with rims, I don't want it (Skrrt)
Stock me out (Ooh, yeah), big block me out (ooh, yeah)
Robocops, they out (Ayy), put my guns in the house (12)
So much cash over this way (Cash), no, no droughts
Too much of alcohol, we need more options
Need more dancers, oh, we way too poppin'
In love with ice and chains, I'm way too flashy
We movin' fast as hell, no, they can't catch me

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Fill that pot with my arm, put that on my mom (Skrrt, skrrt)
Walk around with two drums, call that Under Arm (Bow)
Put that coca on her tongue, bet it get numb (Coca)
Nawf Side, H-Town, nigga, where you from?
