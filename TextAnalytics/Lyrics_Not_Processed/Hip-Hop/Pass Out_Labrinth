[Intro: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, 
it's okay, I'm good
Let's go!

[Hook: Tinie Tempah & 
Labrinth
]
Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and
 pass out

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I’m in charge now
I’m a star and I bought my fucking cast out
I live a very, very, very, wild lifestyle
Heidi and Audrina eat your heart out
I used to listen to "you don’t wanna bring arms house"
I've got so many clothes I keep some in my aunt's house
Disturbing London baby, we about to branch out
Soon I'll be the king like Prince Charles' child
Yeah, yeah and there ain’t nobody fresher
Semester to semester, raving with the freshers
20 light bulbs around my table and my dresser
CLC Kompressor, just in case that don’t impress her
Say hello to Dexter
, 
say hello to Uncle Fester
Got them gazing at my necklace and my crazy sun protectors
G-Shocks, I got a crazy dumb collection
Haters, I can't fucking hear your reception

[Hook: Tinie Tempah & 
Labrinth
]
Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and
 pass out

[Interlude: Tinie Tempah]
Shit was meant to last me 24 hours man

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
They say hello, they say hola and they say bonjour
I’m pissed I never got to fly on a Concorde
I've been Southampton but I've never been to Scunthorpe
I’m fucking crazy with the kicks, call me Jean-Claude
I’m 'bout to be a bigger star than my mum thought
‘Cause every day I got a groupie at my front door
Now I drive past the bus I used to run for
Where’s my fucking clap, where’s my encore?
I walk alone, ‘cause I was born alone
I chirps her just for fun, I never ever call her phone
I leave her in the club, I never ever walk her home
DL the fucking foundation, I'm the cornerstone
I’m born famous, I’m sort of known
And if your son doesn’t, I bet your daughter knows
Check out my visual, check out my audio
Extra ordinary, yo, hope you enjoyed the show

[Hook: Tinie Tempah & 
Labrinth
]
Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and
 pass out

[Bridge: 
Labrinth
 & Tinie Tempah]
Woah
Wooooooooo-oah
Woah
Wooooooooo-oah
Look at me I've been a cheeky bastard, man and
Look at all the drama we started, now I’m
In here laying on my back
Saying, "DJ won't you give me one more track?"
I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning

[Hook: 
Labrinth
 & Tinie Tempah]
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and
 pass out
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and
 pass out
