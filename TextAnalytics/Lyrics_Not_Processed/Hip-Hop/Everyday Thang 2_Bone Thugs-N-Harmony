[Hook]
It’s an everday thang when you let your nuts hang
My niggas they never change
They kickin' it wit the gang and remain the same
So follow me now see
Up to the double Glock and
Hear pistols poppin'
Buckin' them bodies with shots and

[Wish Bone]
Thugstas, put 'em all and bodybags, thugstas
Niggas dead when I'm out, my thugstas got to pump slugs, fuck bustas
Cause I never did love ya
Nigga my niggas will break your neck
Nigga trying to disrepect
Nothin' but killas, and trues I rolls with
We'll cut ya so fuck ya
East 99 is where you'll find us chillin but nigga what's up
Nigga want to get buzzed
Nigga want to get drugged
Nigga really want to get fucked up
Pump pump put them in a trunk
Now watch them fall down to the pavement

[Krayzie Bone]
My nigga just say when
And now I’m runnin' wit the pump let the gauge bang bang
To the brain puff puff got me feelin' lovely
But I need mo' bud see
Finna to slang my dummies
I got the pump to put on the mission for money
And you better run
I’ll grab my gat and flip it wit big shot guns
When I’m come dump slugs in the hood hey now say now how we swang them thangs

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Before we go bust a left, gotta hit the liquor store
(Hit em up economy 64’s, is frozen) 2x

Pap pap stay strapped and again I’m coming to let my lead off
Ready to roll and I shook his head off
And when I get done I’mma blow your head off they lost
Forever that fifth dog nigga dats all be mallin' 'em all

[Layzie Bone]
Y'all fall down from the brawl takin' off them draws hangin' them balls
In Cleveland
Watchin' my back when I’m runnin through my city
Cause nigga it ain't the same
Gotta good aim but I smoke and maintain
Man, crept and we came doing everyday thangs

[Bizzy Bone]
And I won’t get caught up brought up
Outta the cut wit sawed off sawed up
Nigga that brought that pap pap
Every time we call up ya'll up started this heartless
Dummies slang, But I can’t escape my ways

[Flesh n Bone]
Holdin the gauge on the ladies slayed ripsta slit like back in the days
Yes Flesh put 'em to rest

Feelin' the pain runnin this gang insane
To the brain runnin' the same stuff doin' them everyday thangs

It's an everyday thang when you let your nuts hang [Buckin' them bodies with
Shots]
