[Intro]
Today

[Verse 1]
Today, you made me feel irrelevant
Twisted my intelligence
Made it seem there's no brain in my head
I'm like a skeleton, can't shut my eyes
Right now, I feel like I'm an alien
I'm so fuckin' dangerous
Cover up the evidence with medicine
I can't find the light

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody
Kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody
Kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
Today, you turned me like a corkscrew
Filed me like a lawsuit
Put words in my mouth that I don't want you to
And I lost my clout
And my time is actin' as my currency
You can't take that away from me
Treat the young with no accountability
Shoot me down

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody
Kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody
Kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you

[Spoken Interlude]
Right, right now I feel like an alien
Like I'm sitting in a state of perpetual frustration
Go on, shove me again
Fuck with my head, leave me for dead, please?
And yeah, you may think, you may think this is a metaphor
Somethin' you've never heard before
A note I found on the floor
And then subconsciously pinned to the door
But then you motherfuckers could cross a mountain
And I still wouldn't believe what you thought

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody
Kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody
Kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
All I wanna do is kill somebody
Kill somebody
Kill somebody like you
You, you, you, you
Oh, oh
