[Pre-Chorus: Quavo]
I know you wanna go (Migo!)
I know you wanna go (Yuh, rich nigga)
Come on, we takin' off
And I know you don't wanna miss this plane (Go, go)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Started with a hundred bricks (Bricks, bricks, bricks)
Now I sold out, bitch (Bitch, bitch)
My mama said, "Stay patient" (Mama, mama)
Hundred bands, I ain't waitin' (Bands)
I'm figgity figgity fucked up (Fucked up, fucked up)
Boy, you got me fucked up (Ooh, agh)
I'm figgity figgity fucked up (Fucked up, fucked up)
Goddamn, you got me fucked up (Quavo)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Damn, fill my cup up, damn, you got me fucked up (Agh, agh)
Every ugly bitch in here they lookin' bad as fuck (Bad, bad)
She popped a molly, ooh, look at her tongue (Molly)
The bitch that came with me said they want some (Ooh)
Just look at that, Forrest, look at that, Forrest, run (Run)
Got pink in my cup, it's not lookin' like just a bubblegum (Lean, lean)
I'm askin' the bitch what's her name, she tellin' me Cinnamon (Cinnamon)
I want to put all of my glaze on you like a Cinnabon (Go, Cinnabon, go)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Started with a hundred bricks (Bricks, bricks, bricks)
Now I sold out, bitch (Bitch, bitch)
My mama said, "Stay patient" (Mama, mama)

Goddamn, you got me fucked up

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Lil' mama lookin' so gorgeous (Lil' mama)
She ask me "can I afford it" (She did it)
I told her, "Bitch, you got me fucked up"
My Migos chain can pay your mortgage (Migo)
Twenty-four K on my toilet
Pockets enormous, callin' me Norbit (Damn)
Take it from Migos, I'm makin' Tostitos illegal, I might get deported (Immigrant)
You niggas be trippin', you fucked up
If you thinkin' you gon' catch me slippin' (Kla, kla, kla, kla)
Leavin' no witness, Grinch comin' through your chimney (Bow)
I got the Bobby, the Britney, the Iggy
Sorry, I ran outta Whitney (Ooh)
Young nigga, I'm makin' history
Before I die, you gon' remember me (Takeoff)

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo]
I know you wanna go
I know you wanna go (Uh)
Come on, we takin' off (Go, go)
And I know you don't wanna miss this plane (Go, go)
