[Intro: Headie One]
18 hunna for the new rusty
Four and a half in the bando, profit oh-so lovely
169

[Chorus: Headie One]
18 hunna for the new rusty
Man grab it and kick it like rugby
I was in the T house, head back dusty
Still waking up to nudes in country
Four and a half in the bando
Profit oh so lovely
My little bro shitted out the pack and flushed it
Tell me how he could be so clumsy?
These bad Bs coming to the niz
They don't really love me, but they love me
From qway, been doing up upsy
Yeah, I swear man done more sales than Gumtree
If I get me that drop, it won't be nuttin' like Humpty's
Backdoor bus, watch me get dumpy
These opps can't never get comfy

[Verse 1: Headie One]
Heart of a lion
Skenged up for the field
Cah I might buck me a python
Snakes in the grass, I don't know who's preeing on my ting
Still gotta keep money on my mindset
Losing weight all last year
And I ain't ever been on no diet
Shh-shh got shh, all bait
All now gang gotta keep that one quiet
Half asleep last night, I done a night shift
I couldn't even count those tenners and fivers
I was fifteen stepping, stressing out cab drivers
Skengs in the wiz, no licence
I know full well where the 9 is
You can't talk about riding

[Chorus: Headie One]
18 hunna for the new rusty
Man grab it and kick it like rugby
I was in the T house, head back dusty
Still waking up to nudes in country
Four and a half in the bando
Profit oh so lovely
My little bro shitted out the pack and flushed it
Tell me how he could be so clumsy?
These bad Bs coming to the niz
They don't really love me, but they love me
From qway, been doing up upsy
Yeah, I swear man done more sales than Gumtree
If I get me that drop, it won't be nuttin' like Humpty's
Backdoor bus, we could get dumpy
These opps can't never get comfy

[Verse 2: Dave]
Look
No composure, still flip like Motorolas
Diss me? Then I'm phoning bro up
Hop into the oldest motor
My west ting want to leave me
But I told her I need three weeks' notice
Don't listen to them, they're loafers
We got beef with them man's olders
Olders, hocus pocus
Eyes all rolling back
Gotta tap that face like "babes, stay focused"
We ain't ever had no-
You see, most of my Gs got birded
That's why I've still gotta watch for the vultures
Somalis I roll with
So it's akhi on the side like salt fish
Literally
Man's been tryna make history
But my little nigga in the ends
And he's still tryna turn man history
I've got twins in Leicester
Both tryna say that they're into me
But they ain't getting no ring from me
That's Pot Noodles and Indomie
So, man just put dick in her belly
That girl got a big back like tellys
In two-double-0 five, man's not ready
My Somali called Ali, not Dele
That girl wasn't worthy of the bedroom
My brudda, she got touched on the settee
Man came in heavy
You know what it is, it's Dave and Headie

[Chorus: Headie One]
18 hunna for the new rusty
Man grab it and kick it like rugby
I was in the T house, head back dusty
Still waking up to nudes in country
Four and a half in the bando
Profit oh so lovely
My little bro shitted out the pack and flushed it
Tell me how he could be so clumsy?
These bad Bs coming to the niz
They don't really love me, but they love me
From qway, been doing up upsy
Yeah, I swear man done more sales than Gumtree
If I get me that drop, it won't be nuttin' like Humpty's
Backdoor bus, we could get dumpy
These opps can't never get comfy
