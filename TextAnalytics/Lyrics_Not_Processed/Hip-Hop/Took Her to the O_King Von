[Chorus]
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, 
she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip
, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the 
O

[Verse 1]
We in the car, she don't live that far, say she left her purse
And I ain't trippin', you know Von a player, we can go there first
I bust a U, pulled up to her spot, she live by the park
It's gettin' dark, my Glock on my lap, I'm just thinkin' smart
So she hop out, she switchin' and shit, this bitch thick as shit
She got two minutes, if she ain't back out, then she gon' need a Lyft
She left her phone, so I picked it up, this ho slow as fuck
Nine missed calls, three of 'em from Mom, the other six say Duck
Now I look up and I see a truck, it's just pullin' up
Someone hopped out, a big goofy nigga, he tryna look tough
I'm like, "What? What he tryna do?" So I clutched my move
But he kept walkin', he don't want no smoke, boy, he not bulletproof

[Chorus]
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O

[Verse 2]
She walk out, she stop in her tracks, she get to steppin' back
Then I hear smack, this big goofy nigga, he pullin' her tracks
I wanna help, but this ain't my ho, you know how it go
Don't got no cape, I still got her phone, she takin' too long
She get loose, she run to my car, so I hit the locks
Tossed her her phone, told shorty I'm gone, bitch, you on your own
But here come goofy, he hollerin' and shit, yellin' 'bout a bitch
Picked up a brick, he merched it on Brick and threw it at my whip
Now I'm like, "Shit," I hopped out so quick, then I raised my blick
And I don't miss, I let off two shots, I hit him in his shit
Now, Von, think quick, what you finna do? 'Cause this gon' make the news
Gotta make your move, told that bitch, "Get in," 'cause she lookin' confused
I broke the rules, 'cause this bitch a witness, plus I just popped dude
But she ain't cryin', plus this ho was smilin' and this bitch looked cute
So we slide out, I'm checkin' my mirrors, made it to the house
Told her hop out, she say that she hungry, I nod back, "No doubt"
"I know you mad 'cause I smoked your man, left him on the curb"
She started laughin', she say, "Fuck that nigga, he from 63rd"

[Chorus]
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O
Just got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee
Just bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me
This bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go
She wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O

[Outro]
And took her to the O
Huh? What?
Took her to the O
Huh? What?
You know how it go
Huh? What?
This shit ain't for show
Run up, then I blow
Took her to the O
(
