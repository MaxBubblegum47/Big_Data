[Intro]
When it's me and you
I promise that I will be blowing your mind
When the night is through
You gotta promise me that you won't be blowing up my line
You should

[Verse 1]
I think it's amazing, there ain't no use in faking
I never need persuading 'cause I never mind seeing you naked
Darling, you should
Call me, call me at night when you're in the mood
You know it's true
If that's the way you like, that's fine, that's cool

[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright, spend the night
You should know I do it better, but you're gonna want forever
You can be mine
Baby, I don't need forever, but if you wanna get together, that is

[Chorus]
No problem, come through and let's do it
That's no problem, let's get it right to it, we ain't stopping
Yeah, we gon' do it 'til the early morning
Gonna be no problem, we ain't gotta tell nobody
It can be our secret
But you should know, the second we get close
That you ain't never wanna go home

[Verse 2]
That's just how it goes with me
Girls come, never wanna leave
You said no strings attached, you're not looking for a man
Darling, you should
Call me, call me at night when you're in the mood
You know it's cool 'cause
If that's the way you like, that's fine, that's cool

[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright, spend the night
You should know I do it better, but you're gonna want forever
You can be mine
Baby, I don't need forever, but if you wanna get together

[Chorus]
No problem, come through and let's do it
That's no problem, let's get it right to it, we ain't stopping
Yeah, we gon' do it 'til the early morning
Gonna be no problem, we ain't gotta tell nobody
It can be our secret
But you should know, the second we get close
That you ain't never wanna go home

[Bridge]
When it's me and you
I promise that I will be blowing your mind
When the night is through
You gotta promise me that you won't be blowing up my line
Call me, call me at night when you're in the mood
If that's the way you like, that's fine, that's cool

[Chorus]
No problem, come through and let's do it
That's no problem, let's get it right to it, we ain't stopping
Yeah, we gon' do it 'til the early morning
Gonna be no problem, we ain't gotta tell nobody
It can be our secret
But you should know, the second we get close
That you ain't never wanna go home

[Outro]
When it's me and you
I promise that I will be blowing your mind
When the night is through
You gotta promise me that you won't be blowing up my line
Call me, call me at night when you're in the mood
If that's the way you like, that's fine, that's cool
