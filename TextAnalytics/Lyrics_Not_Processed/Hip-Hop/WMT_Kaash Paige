[Intro]
...cube in it, it'll, like
It'll just melt five seconds and it'll take the edge off
Alright, put that ho in there
I gotchu
Ayy, ayy, what's your issue? Uh
Uh, ooh, what's your issue? Uh

[Verse 1]
What's your issue?
Early in the mornin', tryna see what you into
Four-page letter, no pencil
Pourin' out my heart, trying to tell you what I been through
Duh-dun-doo-doo, I don't wanna be here no more
'Cause they don't wanna show me no love
Got money, now these hoes wanna pop up

[Chorus]
There ain't nothin' to see, for sure, ooh
There ain't nothin' to see, for sure
I just want a piece, I just want a piece of your lovin'
Ayy, I just want a piece, I just want a piece of your lovin'
But don't you waste my time, waste my time
Waste my time, waste my time
But don't you waste my time, waste my time
Waste my time, yuh, waste my time
My time

[Verse 2]
Ask her what her sign is, and she say, "Dollar signs," oh, yeah
I'm really tryna make you mine but I don't have the time for that
They only wanna fuck with me because I'm on the map
Got me singin' love songs with my heart gone
I'ma need that back, back, back, yuh

[Chorus]
There ain't nothin' to see, for sure, ooh
There ain't nothin' to see, for sure
I just want a piece, I just want a piece of your lovin'
Ayy, I just want a piece, I just want a piece of your lovin'
But don't you waste my time, waste my time (Waste my time)
Waste my time, waste my time (Waste my time)
But don't you waste my time, waste my time (Waste my time)
Waste my time, yuh, waste my time
My time
