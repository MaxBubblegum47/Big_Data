[Intro: Big Sean]
God, oh, God
Boi, boi
I've been workin' all god damn year, I just got my check
I'm 'bout to spend it all on me, I'm worth it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hol' up, hol' up, tell me what you see (What you see)
Pull up (Swerve), watch these mothafuckas freak (Watch 'em freak)
S-say what up though when you see me in the streets
G.O.O.D. Music in this bitch, now drop that mothafuckin' beat, woah

[Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, see me gettin' guap right now (Yeah)
This to all of my hatin' hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now (Haan?)
This to all my old hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now (Yeah)
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now (Big Sean)
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, I need 50k large (Right now)
My mama need a new crib (Right now)
My daddy need a new car (Right now)
So I be goin' so hard (Right now)
Detroit is my yard (Right now)
I need a 17 car garage (Right now)
I need a 17 broad menage (Right now)
I need a jail house to free my dogs (Right now)
I done paid taxes, paid dues, paid bills my whole life
So I'ma throw money in the air, like I'm tryin' to pay the sky
Told myself that man if I can't live like this, I'd rather die
I give it up to God, and he always replies:
"Control yo' hoes, you let her talk 'til you crazy
You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you no baby!
You fugazi, b-boss up, boss up with your time dog
You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for no time off!"
I'm on

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, see me gettin' guap right now
This to all of my hatin' hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
This to all my old hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now (Oh God)
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now (Oh God, boi, boi, boi)
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, I need 50k large (Right now)
My homie just beat the charge (Right now)
My brother need a new job (Right now)
So I be goin' so hard (Right now)
I need my face on a black card (Right now)
My iPhone need a charge (Right now)
My fish tank need sharks (right now)
I need a blimp to say the worlds ours (Right now)
So these niggas can know I do what they can't
I'm stuntin' for all the people who ain't
You still hatin'? You should be fuckin' ashamed
Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, "Boy, won't you get your rest on?"
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it 'til it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hol' up, hol' up, tell me what you see (What you see)
Pull up (Swerve), watch these mothafuckas freak (Watch 'em freak)
S-say what up though when you see me in the streets
G.O.O.D. Music in this bitch, now drop that mothafuckin' beat, woah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now (D-Town)
See me gettin' guap right now, see me gettin' guap right now
This to all of my hatin' hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
This to all my old hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

[Outro]
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah, woah
Four, three, two, one
This to all my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, won't stop right now
Four, three, two, one
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, won't stop right now
Hell nah, won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now
Four, three, two, one
