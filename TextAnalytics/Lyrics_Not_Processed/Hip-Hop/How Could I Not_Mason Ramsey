[Verse 1]
If you said there's a good old country band
Playin' down on the west end
You say you wanna go, just us, no, don't bring your best friends
Well, I said give me five to get ready
Then your house is where I'll be headed
I'll pick you up with a playlist, ready to rock

[Chorus]
Well, how could I not, knock, knock, baby, knock on your door?
Help you hop up right in my Ford?
Can't afford to miss one minute with you
Oh baby, how could I not
Wanna show you off on the town?
Wanna hold you, spin you around?
Anywhere with you would be hard to top
So, how could I not?

[Verse 2]
Wanna ditch my plans
Come hold your hand, and spend all afternoon
Yeah, there ain't no question if you're asking what I'd rather do
'Cause anytime I know I'm gonna get to see your baby blues
Yeah, that's always an easy choice, the truth

[Chorus]
Well, how could I not, knock, knock, baby, knock on your door?
Help you hop up right in my Ford?
Can't afford to miss one minute with you
Oh baby, how could I not
Wanna show you off on the town?
Wanna hold you, spin you around?
Anywhere with you would be hard to top
So, how could I not?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
How could I not?
Ooh, ooh
How could I not?

[Bridge]
Knock, knock, baby, knock on your door?
Girl, you're always leaving me wantin' more

[Chorus]
So how could I not, knock, knock, baby, knock on your door?
Help you hop up right in my Ford?
Can't afford to miss one minute with you
Oh baby, how could I not
Wanna show you off on the town?
Wanna hold you, spin you around?
Anywhere with you would be hard to top
So, how could I not?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
How could I not?
Ooh, ooh
How could I not?
Ooh, ooh
How could I not?
Ooh, ooh
