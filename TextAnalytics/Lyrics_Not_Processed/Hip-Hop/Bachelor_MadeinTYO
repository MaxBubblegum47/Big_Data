[Intro]
Dun Deal on the tra-a-a-a-ack

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Offset]
Beautiful (Beauty!)
One or two, all of you (Ayy!)
How are you, pop a bean (Hey! Bean!)
Chopped and screwed
Double cup, fill me up (Mud! Drank!)
I'm riding through, Hollywood (Skrrt)
Smoking good, I'm on the move (Gang!)
Beautiful (Hey!)
One or two, all of you (Hey!)
How are you, pop a bean (How are you? Bean!)
Chopped and screwed
Double cup, fill me up (Mud! Drank!)
I'm riding through, Hollywood (Skrrt)
Smoking good, I'm on the move (Hey!)

[Bridge: Offset]
We live our life like some bachelors
Diamonds on me like a bachelor
Phantom on me like a bachelor
Bitches on me like a bachelor
We live our life like a bachelor
Diamonds on me like a bachelor
Phantom on me like a bachelor
Bitches on me like a bachelor

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
These niggas mad at Lil Boat
Nautica sign on my clothes
I keep that work for the low
I give a fuck 'bout a hoe, damn
22 shots to his brain if he stain on my name
Not a joke, not a game
Fuck around and iced up my neck
Do what I need for respect

[Verse 2: MadeinTYO]
Hop in a whip and cut school
I met that lil' bitch straight after school
You cannot play me, I never been fooled
You cannot play me, I never been fooled
Shawty got friends and I'm pulling up
I'm getting head like a uppercut
They don't want war they not tough enough
Shawty just told me I'm glowing up
I need that shit it not out yet
I wanna foreign my outfit
Thumbing and dabbing I run it up
Young niggas never been young enough
I got yo bitch in my spot again
I'm in Shibuya just stacking Yen
Smoking on gas, don't fuck with mid
Don't play me, lil' bitch, I'm not a kid

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Take a good look at where a nigga live
Look at the moves that a nigga did
Look at the faces, a nigga stare
Flick of the wrist we like looky here
Regular bitches play hard to get
It's funny she come but we couldn't pair
Oh no, he didn't done took it there
I done some things that you wouldn't dare
I need the Dior and Prada suits
I need that Raf and that Gucci too
I need JW Anderson
I should pop Pamela Anderson
Calling her pussy an ambulance
Let me record like the cameraman
I'ma zoom in with my camera lens
I'm going in like the Taliban

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Offset]
Beautiful (Beauty!)
One or two, all of you (Ayy!)
How are you, pop a bean (Hey! Bean!)
Chopped and screwed
Double cup, fill me up (Mud! Drank!)
I'm riding through, Hollywood (Skrrt)
Smoking good, I'm on the move (Gang!)
Beautiful (Hey!)
One or two, all of you (Hey!)
How are you, pop a bean (How are you? Bean!)
Chopped and screwed
Double cup, fill me up (Mud! Drank!)
I'm riding through, Hollywood (Skrrt)
Smoking good, I'm on the move (Hey!)
