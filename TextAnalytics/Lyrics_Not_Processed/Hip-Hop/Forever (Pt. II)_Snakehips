[Hook]
(Forever you got me knocked down)
(Forever you got me knocked down)
(Forever you got me knocked down)
(Forever you got me knocked down)

[Verse 1: Kaleem Taylor]
How's the point of disbelieving?
Were you above the borderline?
You pushed me right into the deep end, girl
Ain't got no choice but take the dive

[Chorus: Kaleem Taylor]
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever in my life I see you
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever  you're in my life, I can't lose
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever I know where we're gonna break through
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever you got me, you got me knocked down
Knocked down, you got me knocked down

[Verse 2: Kaleem Taylor]
How's the part of my defenses?
Were you above the edge of time?
You're playing right into my weakness, girl
Ain't got no choice but lose the fight

[Chorus: Kaleem Taylor]
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever in my life I see you
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever you're in my life, I can't lose
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever I know where we're gonna break through
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever you got me, you got me knocked down
Knocked down, you got me knocked down
Knocked down, yeah

[Bridge: Kaleem Taylor]
I can't deny it's early for these feelings
Can't explain where we'll begin
But I've learned some things happen for a reason
So I walked into you knowing will I get

[Chorus: Kaleem Taylor]
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever in my life I see you
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever you're in my life, I can't lose
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever I know where we're gonna break through
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever you got me, you got me knocked down
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever in my life I see you
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever you're in my life, I can't lose
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever I know where we're gonna break through
(Forever you got me knocked down)
Forever you got me, you got me knocked down
Knocked down, you got me knocked down
