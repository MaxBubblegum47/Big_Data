[Intro: Calboy]
Oh-oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh
CZ beats, why you do 'em like that?

[Pre-Chorus: Calboy]
Brand new .45 with the RIP (RIP)
In the trap all night 'cause my dawg don't sleep ('cause my dawg don't sleep, yeah)
Used to live a nightmare, I ain't had no dream (I ain't had no dream)
Seen a lot of niggas die, boy, what you think (Boy, what you think)
If the crew ain't right then the ship gon' sink (Then the ship gon' sink)
And a nigga ain't right from the shit I seen (From the shit I seen, yeah)
Wanna talk about love, bitch, what you mean? (Bitch what you mean, yeah)
Fell in love with this mud, pour up, I drink

[Chorus: Calboy]
'
Cause I've been to war, barbarian (Barbarian)
These niggas talkin', irrelevant (Irrelevant)
My pockets fatter than elephant (They are)
I fell in love with the medicine
I'm sick in the head, I need medicine
Can you tell me why your shooters hesitant?
Say you come from that block, you never been
I never fold, I never bend, yeah

[Verse 1: Calboy]
Bitches better watch they back
You know I grip on this MAC
And I heard what you said
We spot a nigga, it's that
And I point it at his head
I bet his shit it go splat, hey
I put my boys on the map, hey
I come from cookin' the crack, hey
Boy you better not try to run, you can get shot in your back, hey
I fell in love with the mud, you know it keep me relaxed, hey
She wanna talk about love, I don't wanna hear none of that
If I said it won't take the shit back
If she left me, ain't no comin' back
And I'm still on 147, I ain't changin' up, hey
Say they want smoke with us, he smokin' angel dust
And these bitches be so damn weird, niggas be strange as fuck
Niggas can't bang with us, niggas can't hang with us, hey
Gotta tie my shoelaces, bitch I ain't trippin'
Since a shorty, I knew I was different, hey
Me and you ain't the same, and they can tell the difference
Gotta stay focused, bitch, I'm on a mission

[Pre-Chorus: Calboy]
Brand new .45 with the RIP (RIP)
In the trap all night 'cause my dawg don't sleep ('cause my dawg don't sleep, yeah)
Used to live a nightmare, I ain't had no dream (I ain't had no dream)
Seen a lot of niggas die, boy, what you think (Boy, what you think)
If the crew ain't right then the ship gon' sink (Then the ship gon' sink)
And a nigga ain't right from the shit I seen (From the shit I seen, yeah)
Wanna talk about love, bitch, what you mean? (Bitch what you mean, yeah)
Fell in love with this mud, pour up, I drink

[Chorus: Calboy]
'Cause I've been to war, barbarian (Barbarian)
These niggas talkin', irrelevant (Irrelevant)
My pockets fatter than elephant (They are)
I fell in love with the medicine

Can you tell me why your shooters hesitant?
Say you come from that block, you never been
I never fold, I never bend, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Tjay]
Mike Amiri, this a new swag
20k in my pockets, it's too fat
JT got a young nigga too smashed
Summertime, we goin' hunt for a new pack
I done got me a buzz, I can't lose that
Choose this, fuck one, I need two straps
Niggas tryna put me in the news (No)
Missed your friend, I'm like "Why would you do that?"
RIP, ain't no gettin' your crew back
Dome bullets, we aimin' for du-rags
Everybody gon' get it, fuck who that
My new bitch from the hollow so move back
Strapped up, 'cause we ready for war now
Boss nigga, gon' finna explore now
Same energy, never gon' change (Change)
Kept it real in rain while it poured down (Poured down)
I was stuck in the field, now it's back to it (Back to it)
40k, just been takin' my mask off (Mask off)
Niggas watchin', so fuck it, I act soft
But it's on me, no reason to pass off
'Cause they don't wanna see me get to the top (No)
They don't wanna see the hood or the block
They don't wanna see the chain, the watch
They don't wanna see the young nigga pop, no, no
Smelly drive, I'd give all up for my nigga, no lie (No lie)
Right through the struggle, he stayed by my side
He looked down my eyes, I witnessed him die
Swear the shit a nigga seen no joke (No joke)
Paper on me, gotta keep it lil' tote (No smoke)
Every nigga by my side on go (Oh-oh)
If you really what you claim then show it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Calboy]
Brand new .45 with the RIP (RIP)
In the trap all night 'cause my dawg don't sleep ('cause my dawg don't sleep, yeah)
Used to live a nightmare, I ain't had no dream (I ain't had no dream)
Seen a lot of niggas die, boy, what you think (Boy, what you think)
If the crew ain't right then the ship gon' sink (Then the ship gon' sink)
And a nigga ain't right from the shit I seen (From the shit I seen, yeah)
Wanna talk about love, bitch, what you mean? (Bitch what you mean, yeah)
