[Chorus: Joji]
Every time I go closer to the road, leavin' my light
I just wanna know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night
It's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right
I don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
Sittin' in my crib thinkin' 'bout shit
That I never done, but I wish I did
Actin' like I'm fine, but I'm losin' it
Coulda kissed that girl, but it ain't relevant
Coulda made that move, I'm regrettin' it
Feelin' so low, like I'm on 2%
Been livin' life like it's a tournament
Loneliness turned off and now it's on again
Tell myself run, ain't no lookin' back
Only time I do is when I'm reachin' for the stack
Back on my old ways, on my old Mac
Thinkin' 'bout my old days, I'll never go back
Fuck that, tryna get myself my own crib
Be an independent man, I might just suck my own dick
Ain't got time, baby just tryna gold dig
Gotta get through all the people that I roll with

[Chorus: Joji]
Every time I go closer to the road, leavin' my light
I just wanna know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night
It's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right
I don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Yeah, hole in my soul, don't know how to fill it up
Cannot let nobody in, hopin' that they understand
Can't change my ways, this how I get through my days
It's just how your boy was raised, vigilant in every way
Every single night I've been stayin' up
My imagination's takin' flight and it's takin' off
And my time is slowly tickin' now, I don't wanna wait anymore
Don't wanna be erased, wanna make a change

[Bridge: Joji & Rich Brian]
Please don't hurt me, I've just lost my way
(My way, my way, my way)
Leave no trace of my misery, get me through the day
Get me through the day (get me through the-)

[Chorus: Joji]
Every time I go closer to the road, leavin' my light
I just want to know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night
It's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right
I don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride
