[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah, you hear that?
That's inevitability
You can't stop this shit
I'm too tapped in, too loyal

[Verse 1: Big Sean & 
Future
]
Surrounded by a few of my niggas who did breakin' and enterin'
Through a bidness with them because they can't break a commitment (No)
Look, I'm a magician, I belong inside Magic City
Got too much intuition to just blow tuition on titties, I know
Young Metro got that stick, that's a cig', he don't smoke
Fuck around, get smoked
I can't think of one time I was put up on the spot then I choked (I can't)
I can't think of one time I got rich then went broke
 
(
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Bitch, I'm doin' digits, all business, big bidness (Big)
See me on the block? Mmm-hmm, bitch, it's still bidness (Still)
See my dick off in her mouth? Yup, bitch, it's still bidness (Oh)
Ye said, "Kill 'em all," God the only witness
So I'm set, sunset (Skrrt)
Put it down for the team that I protect (For my team, yeah)
Bitch, please do not interject (Don't)
If you move too quick, I might take it as a threat (Threat)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I'm consistent, I'm persistent, got to get it, bitch, I risk it
Time to hit them big licks and make that shit a tradition
Yeah, what goes around comes around faster than fidgets (Woah)
Man, out you is frigid (Woah), man, these streets is vicious (Vicious)
'Bout to get my girl, some kids just to start a family bidness
'Cause it's all about bidness, yeah, big digit bidness
Yeah, look, we out here tryna start a franchise (Franchise)
We tell the truth, you tellin' stories 'round the campfire (Lil' bitch)
Yeah, it's all game, ho, let it soak (Let it soak)
Me and my bros rock the same chains around like we a cult (God)
I'm the one in the bunch, they protect me like the Pope
Goin' all night on the daily though, rollin' down 7 Mile, bet a thou'
Hit downtown then hit the Isle (Skrrt)
Nothin' free, not even style
, 
free Vezzo, yeah, let him out (Free)
King of my city, man, I feel like I'm Coretta child
I'm my mama son, I gotta rise, I can't let her down

[Chorus: Big Sean & 
2 Chainz
]
Bitch, I'm doin' digits, all business, big bidness (Big)
See me on the block? Mmm-hmm, bitch, it's still bidness (Still)
See my dick off in her mouth? Yup, bitch it's still bidness (Oh)
Ye said, "Kill em all," God the only witness
So I'm set, sunset (Skrrt)
Put it down for the team that I protect (For my team, yeah)
Bitch, please do not interject (Don't)
If you move too quick, I might take it as a threat (
Yeah, 2 Chainz
)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Got 'em waitin' for my verses like it's Christmas decor
Would talk about my exes, but I'm dissin' them all
Bought foreclosed houses and I'm fixin' them all
Anytime I caught work, it was pistols involved (Bow)
Yeah, I'm talkin' big business, here go the statistics
One out every five people trappin' turn snitches
Get up out the game, put it up for a rainy
Hardest-workin' man in showbiz, no complainin' (No complainin')
Yeah, I get a rush from the grind (Ooh)
Touchdown, bust down, single for tonight (Yeah)
When she come over, deep tissue, neck shoulder (Shoulder)
Got a restaurant, a label, and a clothin' line, I ain't lyin' (Nah)
Lyin' down the street (street), discount code, first come, gon' eat (Eat)
And this ain't for the weak, I do it every week (Uh, uh)
I do it in my sleep, got in it like ink (Uh, in it)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Bitch, I'm doin' digits, all business, big bidness (Big)
See me on the block? Mmm-hmm, bitch, it's still bidness (Still)
See my dick off in her mouth? Yup, bitch, it's still bidness (Oh)
Ye said, "Kill em all," God the only witness
So I'm set, sunset (Skrrt)
Put it down for the team that I protect (For my team, yeah)
Bitch, please do not interject (Don't)
If you move too quick, I might take it as a threat (Woah, woah)

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Look, boy, the bidness internal
The vision's eternal, these niggas will burn you
Don't ask no questions if that shit don't concern you (Woah)
I've been standin' outside all day, man, rockin' my thermal
My off-white came straight from Virgil (Straight)
My brothers on side of me
That's who I turn to when shit gets too turnt to handle it
Dolo, it's too lit, inferno (lit)
While you was dozin', I thought I was nocturnal
I wrote every single success I had first in the journal
You bitches nothin' but hurdles (Nothin')
Boy, I'll hop right over you, who the fuck you think watchin' over you? (Huh?)
I'm God's favorite, you couldn't pray a hundred times a day to have me over through
I'm the bipolar you, I'm doin' what you way too hoe to do (Ho)
I got a ocean-view overview that reminded me this is overdue
Jeez, I don't got feelings, I just fill seats, I'm on fleek
I don't retreat, I did this shit in my sleep (Woah, woah, woah)
Sike, I don't sleep, I don't cuddle
Bitch, I'm the team captain inside the huddle
The man of my house and the man your little brother grew up to (Straight)
The man in my hood and all the other hats that I juggle (Straight)
You niggas my little cuzzos, lil' niggas (Lil' niggas)
Nobody sonnin' me, if I am a sun, I'm the one you look up to
(I look up), fuck you

[Outro: Big Sean & 
Future

Big bidness (Woah, woah, uh-huh)
Yeah, yeah
