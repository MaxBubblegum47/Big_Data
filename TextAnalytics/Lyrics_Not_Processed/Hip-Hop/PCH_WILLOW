[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Man, I'm PCH cruising
My girl she snoozing
She was all night boozing
No love, here to be losing
I don't care who's in the car cause really
We just PCH cruising
My girl snoozing
She was all night boozing
No love, here to be losing
I don't care who's in the car cause really
We just PCH cruising

[Bridge: Willow Smith]
We just PCH, PCH, PCH, PCH driving
We're the crazy kids, rebel kids, saddened kids, wild kids, lonely kids

You can come and cry if you come through
You can hug the sky if you want to
You can come and cry if you come through
You can hug the sky if you want to
Cause you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
And the moon is full, moon is full, moon is full, moon is full

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
Baby you can be my catfish (Jaden)
I never see you I just text you on the phone
And you look just like that actress
What's her name?
I'm afraid that if I see you I'mma freakin' suffocate
Or do a backflip
Yeah, I'm knocking at your door
But I died so they put me in a casket
People say Jay you're just over-reacting
But your like the girl that I never had
You're my catfish
I never see you I just text you on the phone
And you look just like that actress
What's her name?
I'm afraid that if I see you I'mma freakin' suffocate
Or do a backflip
Yeah, I'm knocking at your door
But I died so they put me in a casket
People say Jay you're over-reacting
But your like the girl that I never had
You're my catfish
