[Verse 1]
Put your gear into fire
Lay your bullets on the ground
Turn your head to desire
There's a woman going down

[Per-Chorus]
She said she'd rough you up, all the way
And she gonna spit you out
Count your days
She said, "choice is yours", casually
So, why don't you do what comes naturally?

[Chorus]
Sink the pink, it's all the fashion
Drink the drink, it's old-fashioned
Gimme water, gimme wine
Going to show you a good time
Sink the pink
Sink the pink

[Verse 2]
Got a fever running high
Give you wings to make you fly
She school you like a fool
She make you break the rules

[Pre-Chorus]
She wanna get a shot, hit that spot
And I'm gonna rack 'em up, get that hot
She say, "make it good, satisfy"
You know that woman got Dallas eyes

[Chorus]
Sink the pink, it's all the fashion
Drink the drink, it's old-fashioned
Gimme water, gimme wine
Going to show you a good time
Sink the pink
Sink the pink

I want you to sing it for me

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Sink the pink, it's all the fashion
Drink the drink, it's old-fashioned
Gimme water, gimme wine
Going to show you a good time
Sink the pink
Sink the pink
