[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
So I built you a house

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Tryna find revenge in the dark
I think I know where you went
Tryna find your spirit is hard
I think I know how to spend
My weeks are evil
Your brother don't want me here
Your family hates me
My parents don't know I'm here
It'd be better if you loved me
But he told me love myself and that's true
It'd be nice if you could help me
But he told me help myself and that's true
The sky ain't gon' be fixed tonight
I know for sure the sky ain't perfect (Ohh)

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I'm swimmin' in a sea of regret
The more I sink I forget how to swim
I try to breathe, I know the feeling too well
Of fighting myself, I'm losing again
Why am I here? Cold and alone
The sea ain't a home, but it's still where I lay
And still to this day, bad credit with karma
Lighting blunts underwater
Still ain't goin' too well, so I keep to myself
