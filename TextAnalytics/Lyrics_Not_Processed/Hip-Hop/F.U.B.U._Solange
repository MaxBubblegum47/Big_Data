[Intro: Solange]
One for us

[Chorus 1: Solange]
All my niggas in the whole wide world
All my niggas in the whole wide world
Made this song to make it all y'all's turn
For us, this shit is for us

[Chorus 2: Solange]
All my niggas let the whole world know
Play this song and sing it on your terms
For us, this shit is for us
Don't try to come for us

[Chorus 3: Solange]
All my niggas got the whole wide world
Tell them niggas that it's all our turn
This us, some shit is a must
Some shit is for us

[Verse 1: Solange]
When you know you gotta pay the cost
Play the game just to play the boss
So you thinking what you gained, you lost
But you know your shit is taking off, oh
When you driving in your tinted car
And you're criminal, just who you are
But you know you're gonna make it far, oh

[Verse 2: Solange]
When you feeling all alone
And you can't even be you up in your home
When you even feeling it from your own
When you got it figured out
When a nigga tryna board the plane
And they ask you, "What's your name again?"
Cause they thinking, "Yeah, you're all the same."
Oh, it's for us

[Chorus 4: Solange]
All my niggas in the whole wide world
Made this song to make it all y'all's turn
For us, this shit is for us
Some shit is a must
This shit is for us

[Verse 3: Solange]
When it's going on a thousand years
And you pulling up to your crib
And they ask you where you live again
But you running out of damns to give, oh
I hope my son will bang this song so loud
That he almost makes his walls fall down
Cause his momma wants to make him proud
Oh, to be us

[Chorus 5: Solange]
And all my niggas in the whole wide world
Made this song to make it all y'alls turn
For us
This shit is for us
Sometimes we don't trust
This shit is for us

[Verse 4: The-Dream]
And we bomb on sight, on sight we must charge
Host of my emotion, it's your call
Liquor in my system, we must crawl
Addiction, disobey the law
Don't clip my wings before I learn to fly
I didn't come back down to Earth to die

[Chorus 6: Solange]
All my niggas in the whole wide world
Made this song to make it all y'all's turn
For us, this shit is from us
Get so much from us
Then forget us

[Chorus 7: Solange]
Don't feel bad if you can't sing along
Just be glad you got the whole wide world
This us
This shit is from us
Some shit you can't touch

[Outro: All]
Ooh, oh baby
For us baby
Yeah
It's all for us baby
Nobody else, baby
All for us baby
