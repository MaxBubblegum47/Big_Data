[Verse 1]
It's a cool story when you get it right
You see me when I'm out of sight
I don't wanna start a fight with you
And we can't stay in the lines
I can't help when I'm always right
I kinda wanna start a fight with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is all we knew
Feeling you for you
Feeling me and you

[Chorus]
Go on and say it to my face, then
Say it to my face, then
I wanna feel something
Get mad, maybe start complaining
Make me go insane, then
I wanna feel something
Say it to my face, then
Just say it to my face, then

[Verse 2]
Come home and you're always nice
It all feels a bit too right
When you come in, you come inside
Now I don't know what happens next
Watch a movie, have some sex
Never know what's going on inside

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This is all we do, and it's all too soon
Baby me and you

[Chorus]
Go on and say it to my face, then
Say it to my face, then
I wanna feel something
Get mad, maybe start complaining
Make me go insane, then
I wanna feel something
Say it to my face, then
Just say it to my face, then

[Bridge]
And I keep falling into love too easily
And you keep falling into love, in love with me
And I keep falling out of love so easily
And they keep falling back in love, in love with me

[Chorus]
Go on and say it to my face, then
Say it to my face, then
I wanna feel something
Get mad, maybe start complaining
Make me go insane, then
I wanna feel something
Say it to my face, then
Just say it to my face, then
Say it to my face, then
Just say it to my face, then
Say it to my face, then
