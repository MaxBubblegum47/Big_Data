I was thinking ‘bout the
Ice that I put on
Money that I blown
Bitches that I known
Everything that I did wrong
All the licks I hit
All the bullets missed
Got my shit legit
A lot of people pissed
Well, I got money coming through
Drugs and women coming too

[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash]
Every day I wake up and I praise the lord (thank u)
Cause it’s another day I get to ride around in what they can’t afford
I beg your pardon, my whip’s clean, I’m fresh as fuck
My bitch mean, there’s no pressing her
She freshen up while I’m resting up
So when I wake up it’s to naked butt
On the regular, my niggas
I been gold, go figure
So they spoil me like I was royalty
I'm well taught to be so that's venom
On the beat I go gorilla
Guaranteed to go formula
Errrtime, on time, I got money all in my phone line
I said one time for my crew
I hope you get paid as fuck, ‘cause we do
I hope you get laid as fuck, ‘cause we do
But what if we lame as fuck, that makes you
Haterade for the hater, mane
I’m on layaway in this player shade
With mad wishes, two bad bitches
That use the dick to play badminton

I got money coming through
Drugs and women coming too

[Verse 2: Dusty McFly]
Bag on the way dog
I’m just waiting on it, one phone call
Told my niggas don’t stress some shit
Cause one day we all gon’ ball
Real nigga from day one
I’m putting all of my niggas on
Real nigga from four one
Niggas know that’s my hood dog
I wake up with a hangover
Off Rosé and Dom P
Lightskin nigga white [?] ho
Swear to god they seen Bun B
Finger [?] where you find me
Broke ass niggas can’t outshine me
Paid twenty [?] for the time piece
And the wipe-ups cost five sheets
Been grinding nonstop for eight weeks
Bout to hit your main bitch, she a straight freak
Been thinkin’ ‘bout flooding me an AP
Cause the spot still banging like Dre Beats
Got rows on the wrist, bought eight each
Can’t y’all broke niggas fade me
Y’all ho ass niggas, they hate me
But it’s always fuck you pay me

Drugs and women coming too
Got my family living comfortable
I’m doing what I’m supposed to do
I’m doing what I’m supposed to do
I’m doing what I’m supposed to do
I’m doing what I’m supposed to do
