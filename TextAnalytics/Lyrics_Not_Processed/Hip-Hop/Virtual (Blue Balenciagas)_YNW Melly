[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Young Nigga World
Young Nigga Way, yeah
EY3ZLOW on the beat

[Chorus]
We gon' pull up with them sticks and hop out with them choppers
Walking out the ten in blue Balenciagas
I caught an opp, now I got blood on blue Balenciagas
Up that .40, let that pistol sing a melody
Fuck all of that talking, we can go to war
Leave your brain marinating on the boulevard
I got something that'll put you out your misery
Seven point six two, five point five six's, two-two-three

[Verse 1]
With that K, broad day, we hop out and spray
Young Nigga World, Young Nigga Way until my dying day
You ain't 'bout that action, boy, let's not pretend
Caught you lacking after school and shot at all your friends
It go like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Unload the clip, reload the clip, and then you spin again
And if they out when you come back then bitch, you spin again
Congratulations, I just taught you how to spin a bend

[Chorus]
We gon' pull up with them sticks and hop out with them choppers
Walking out the ten in blue Balenciagas
I caught an opp, now I got blood on blue Balenciagas
Up that .40, let that pistol sing a melody
Fuck all of that talking, we can go to war
Leave your brain marinating on the boulevard
I got something that'll put you out your misery
Seven point six two, five point five six's, two-two-three

[Verse 2]
Two-two-three, AR-15's
Carbon-9's, they all on me
Fuck with me, you get murked
It ain't shit to put a pussy nigga on a shirt
Fuck all that talking, we all 'bout that action
We pull up with pistols, you know that we blasting
These niggas ain't really on it, they pussy
I swear to God all these niggas dramatic
Hold up, actually, I wanna fuck her
Pussy run up, we gon' put him on a t-shirt
With it, yeah, with it
Pull up on him with a TEC, huh
Run up on me, you get wet, nigga
Fuck with me, that you'll regret
I got some niggas who really be with it
You niggas pussy, you pussy or friendly
You niggas pussy, you don't want no action
All of my niggas gon' turn you to past tense
We got Glocks with hundred rounds, huh
Catch an opp, kill an opp, lay him down
Fuck with us, you get murked, facts, nigga
Big B's, double-O twenty-ten-nine, this brrat, nigga

[Chorus]
We gon' pull up with them sticks and hop out with them choppers
Walking out the ten in blue Balenciagas
I caught an opp, now I got blood on blue Balenciagas
Up that .40, let that pistol sing a melody
Fuck all of that talking, we can go to war
Leave your brain marinating on the boulevard
I got something that'll put you out your misery
Seven point six two, five point five six's, two-two-three
