[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Uh, yeah, how you doin' today?
Uh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah
Ace the Creator, man, look
Casey Veggies, uh-huh, Odd Future, look

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Hello, the hype is so mellow
Bitch I'm dope but my pipe is so yellow
The blue polka dots, pink stripes and it's pink on the title
Nigga, fuck your role model, bitch, I'm my own idol and
If you can't face it, my nigga, you can ass it
My accessorized accessories bring out my assets
Nigga, they sound on acid, tablets
Stussyâ€™s G-Shock with my custom pair of 3D glasses
I suffer from ADHD
I should win a fucking award for being me
Beat banging, the tom-toms
My producer selection is fresh, nigga, fuck Vons
Ace the underdog, throw them on the back bender
'Cause I change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender
Eating Belgian waffles with Italian biscotts
I sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off
And to you emo kids who walk around pissed off
Step one: pull your panties down and start to piss off
Step two: run to your radio, turn this shit off
Nigga didn't bother, so my father didn't help
So when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me
With Gucci belts, Gucci imprint from leather welts

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
Uh-huh, yea, Ace the Creator, man
Uh, Casey Veggies, yo
Uh-huh, Odd Future, nigga
Get used to, uh, let me-
Ay, I'mma slow it down, right quick for you

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm so dapper man, funky fresh Dapper Dan
I'm your favorite rapper, fan, it's an honor to shake my hand
On award tour, on excursions, I'm a virgin of swap meets
I'm so pure, so sick, it's no cure
I'm dope, where the fiends at? Aight, where the jeans at?
The hat, the crew, the t-shirt is Supreme

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
And they see me they play Pictionary
I got a good way with words like a dictionary
And in that dictionary, my name is by "Fresh"
They at the same spot they making no progress
Becoming a good rapper ain't that easy of a process
Eargasms, they have them
The hotels we staying in twelve-star
Tyler said, "Yo, Casey, just write a twelve bar"
If I'm with twelve people, I'm with twelve stars
You haters put up your guards
They against us? Oh, no
