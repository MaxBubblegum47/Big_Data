[Intro]
Lil TJay
Uh

[Verse 1]
I pop out in all new designer
Smellin' like Dolce Gabbana
Rollin' up marijuana
Ya bitch had me "Como te llamas?"
Ya bitch, she ain't really a fronter (Ooh)
Know I could fuck if I wanna
I might just tell her I love her
I might just fuck her and dub her
Last bitch I hit with a rubber (Ooh)
I couldn't bust on her covers
Had too much respect for her mother
Ain't wanna lay hands on her brother
Flexin', she all on my huevos (Ooh)
I just be chasin' these pesos
Told her I ain't tryna fuck now
She said, "I'll still give you head though"
So we went to go get a bottle (Ooh)
She said Ceretto Moscato
Chillin', I'm all at her mouth wit' it
I bust a nut and she swallowed

[Chorus]
Put TYB on my resume
Keep it real, boy, don't interrogate
I fucked your bitch, I ain't hesitate
Put TYB on my resume
She was a average bitch anyway
I left her then moved on to better things (Skrrt)
She was an average bitch anyway
I left her then moved on to better things

[Verse 2]
Wassup, is you tryna get high today?
'Cause I'ma need wings when I fly away
I gassed her, she thought she could ride my face
She asked me when, I said, "Yo no se"
This money be comin' in every way
I stay on my grind every-everyday
That pussy be wetter than seven lakes
I beat it, she love how I treat it (Yeah)
I know I'm the shit, I'm conceited (Yeah)
I got her addicted, she need it (Now)
If I was a book she would it read it
Said if I was a book she would read it
I'm tryna come up with my mans though
Ain't got no time for no damn ho
I kill it and leave it like Rambo
I play bitches like the piano
This money keep comin', got handfuls
And niggas be hatin', they fans though
I bug out on all instrumentals
It might be my time, but I can't go
So plenty of bitches got ran through
I'm just that nigga, it's simple
I love all the clout and attention
That's why I'ma cop me a mansion
This hustle don't come with a pension
I'm workin' on shit I ain't mentioned
I'm workin' on shit I ain't mentioned
We workin' on shit I ain't mentioned
(Mention)

[Chorus]
Put TYB on my resume (Yeah)
Keep it real, boy, don't interrogate (Nah)
I fucked your bitch, I ain't hesitate (Nah)
Put TYB on my resume
She was a average bitch anyway
I left her then moved on to better things
She was an average bitch anyway
I left her then moved on to better things

[Verse 3]
Down for my niggas, don't come in between
Yeah, that's your bitch, but she comin' with me
She like my 'fro so she fuck with my team
She like the print that she see in my jeans
She said, "I'm different," I'm like, "What you mean?"
Shorty keep callin', I'm lettin' it ring
All she gon' say is, "I'm doin' my thing"
Gotta start somewhere, I'm chasin' my dream
Started off hungry like Jack and the Bean
Hurt me to say that I'm drug to the fiends
I'ma get money, that's by any means
Not worried 'bout niggas that's worried 'bout me
Yeah, I'm from Ryer and 183
Used to be deep now it's nobody free
Do it for Smelly, I do it for E
Bitches on me and I don't give a fuck
Sometimes I feel like it's all about us
Free all my niggas, I'm turnin' shit up
Codeine with the Sprite, ain't no ice in my cup
Yo' bitch finessin' my dick like a dutch
TYB Season, I'm home and it's here
I take yo bitch anytime of the year
'Bout to take off and I'm switchin' my gear
Only 16 and I'm on my way there
Niggas be hatin', I really don't care
Niggas be hatin', I really don't care
I really don't care
(I really don't care, I really don't care)

[Chorus]
Put TYB on my resume (Yeah)
Keep it real, boy, don't interrogate (Nah)
I fucked your bitch, I ain't hesitate (Nah)
Put TYB on my resume
She was a average bitch anyway
I left her then moved on to better things
She was an average bitch anyway
I left her then moved on to better things

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Got up out my Birkin, It's workin'
She said she a virgin, it's hurtin'
She my biggest fan, she always lurkin'
And she know I'm a man, I'ma put that work in
And I know she can't stand me, I'm fancy
So I'ma bring her out when I get my Grammy
Late night sex, she can't find her panties
I couldn't hold it in, now she need a Plan B
His bitch need a Plan B
Lil TJay fancy
