[Intro: NexXthursday]
Ayy, oh

[Chorus: NexXthursday]
I'm sittin' in my room and I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm all out of prescriptions, but you still mess up my head
They say ring around the rosie, don't put rings on none these hoes
You got me in and out of focus
Girl, you gotta feel like you're famous
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
'Cause you don't make me feel like I'm worth it
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Girl, you make me feel like...

[Verse 1: lilbootycall]
Bae, bae, bae, would you save me, though? (Shit)
Ain't been outside, I've been stayin' low
Bad lil' thing call me baby gold
Bank K.O., Rodeo
And lately, I've been feelin' crazy, ay
Suicidal thoughts, yep, day-to-day
Boolin' in my Bape, yup, paid today
Prolly shoot myself in a Bentley, okay
None of this shit don't matter to me no
Lovey-dovey life, yep, all a placebo
Everyone cheat, what can I believe, ho?
Just some other shit I'll never believe though
Who really there for the fame?
Who really there for the mane?
Can't make a dime go hundred, where's the change?
From lint to a hundred in a year, that's change, I'm...

[Chorus: NexXthursday with GoldLink]
I'm sittin' in my room and I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm all out of prescriptions, but you still mess up my head
They say ring around the rosie, don't put rings on none these hoes
You got me in and out of focus
Girl, you gotta feel like you're famous
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
'Cause you don't make me feel like I'm worth it
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Girl, you make me feel like...

[Verse 2: GoldLink & NexXthursday]
Yeah, give me that OJ, your love so sweet (Shit)
Have a nigga reminiscin' for days, shoot
Give me that OJ, your love so sweet
Make a nigga wanna go out my way for you
Shawty bring peace to my mind
Every time that I can't think right, and I can't cope
Can't light a flame with no candle
Let it string along with no banjo
Too intimate, diligent, she move too militant
She be my strength and a high, uh
Elevation, not my pride
Every time I'm at her door I come inside, uh
She got ignition and drive, huh
Independent with a glide, uh
Know me well and know my size, uh
She noble with the prize
Make me fly out my window like Peter Pan
Way I play with the pussy make PETA dance
Way we raisin' the bar, I don't need a Xan
Might just dip on the set like I'm Killa Cam
Hit the corner, we kissin' and touchin', she lustin'
We be actin' 'cause we always fuckin'
But we know we don't want no discussion
So no fussin', let's just skip to us, then

[Chorus: NexXthursday]
I'm sittin' in my room and I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm all out of prescriptions, but you still mess up my head
They say ring around the rosie, don't put rings on none these hoes
You got me in and out of focus
Girl, you gotta feel like you're famous
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
'Cause you don't make me feel like I'm worth it
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Girl, you make me feel like...
Shit
