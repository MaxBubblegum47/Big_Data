[Chorus]
Think I got a sense for a mosh pit
Likes on the 'Gram make a bitch think she poppin'
Ay, and I keep a cock for a thick bitch
Beat around the bush, I keep a mop for a misfit

[Verse 1]
Ay, goin' soul searchin' with the demons
Murder in July, my mama made me mind my business
I don't follow my ex on Instagram
Cancelled out my life if you fishin' for attention
Bitch, my grandma love me, so a nigga straight
I don't need a lil bae, Baby Keem stay patient, uh
Always looking out for the fake
Add a stranger to my list, unfamiliar faces
Gang, gang, gang, I live a lifestyle
Your bitch wanna fuck me, want the dick cause I'm famous (Yeah, uh)
Baby Keem got you niggas shook
Ten trap phones 'cause the feds takin' notice
Bitch, I had a long night, where you at, ho?
Lettin' her in my life and she got me losin' focus

[Chorus]
Yeah, think I got a sense for a mosh pit
Likes on the 'Gram make a bitch think she poppin'
Ay, and I keep a cock for a thick bitch
Beat around the bush, I keep a mop for a misfit

[Interlude]
Hello?
Bro

[Refrain]
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
Stupid bitch

[Verse 2]
Stupid bitch, (Top) when I'm hot it's a tandem
Fake niggas drop, let they hoes call me handsome
And I don't fuck with a snake, he's an actor
Started getting paid, now my jersey's in the rafters
Take cover when I take off on you
Pimp shit, ain't losin', they get my payoff on you
That's how I floss, three nigga round me when I shop
Pull up, I got one night off
I'ma hit it then your blocked

[Outro]
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro
I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent, bro

[Interlude]
Look, I know I'm wrong
We're both wrong
Just call me back, Keem
