[Verse 1]
Move to the city with me
I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone
You're too pretty for me
Baby, I know, it's true, yeah
You look better when you first wake up
Than anybody else I've fucked
Baby, I got good luck with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't know we'd get so far
And it's only the start
Baby, you got me worried (Ay)

[Chorus 1]
Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooo, yeah, I need you here, oh
Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooo, yeah, I need you here

[Verse 2]
Drivin' through the city with me
Just watching you glow
I'm in the passenger seat, you're in control
It's on you now, mhm
You look better every day, I swear
Really, it's a little unfair
Baby, I'm star-struck by you

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't know we'd get so far
And it's only the start
Baby, you got me worried (Ay)

[Chorus 1]
Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooo, yeah, I need you here, woah
Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me
As much as you do
Ooo, yeah, I need you here

[Bridge]
If we fall apart
Maybe it wasn't meant to be
If we fall apart
Then it was our favorite dream
Ooo, ooo, ehh

[Chorus 2]
Your love is therapy
No drug can give me clarity
As much as you do (As you do, babe)
Ooo, yeah, I need you here (I need you here)
Your love is scaring me (No one)
No one has ever cared for me (Ooh, baby)
As much as you do
Ooo, (Hey, yeah) yeah, I need you here (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Outro]
Ooo, I need you, babe
Ooo, ooo, ahh
Yeah, yeah, I need you, baby
Yeah
Ooo, I need you
