[Intro]
Yeah, Herbo
G Herbo, G Herbo
Yeah, I got bitches
Yeah, I like bitches

[Chorus]
Yeah my name G Herbo, I like nasty bitches
I like classy bitches, lil' fake sassy bitches
I got ratchet bitches, bossed up bad bitches
Foreign swag bitches, Birkin bag bitches
Ion't want that stupid bitch, bougie, stay on basic shit
All that makeup shit, man I hate that shit
Why yo' eyebrows fake? Bitch erase that shit
Bitch I’m high as fuck, I’m just tryin' fuck

[Verse 1]
Bitch I’m high as fuck, you know I’m tryin' fuck
I'ma go so berserk, that’s why I’m off this Perc
My ambitious bitch FaceTime me on her way to work
Yellow lil stripper bitch, talk to me on her way to twerk
She like Gucci slides, buy em two at a time
Call her suicide, she tryin' suicide
On her 'Gram, she so happy, call her cutie pie
She do dat to hide her cold heart cause she blue inside
Pull up in a new G-Wag'
Sky blue body paint, soo-woo inside
And my project bitch got her seat belt off
Tote a lil deuce-deuce in the ride
Can’t trust not one bipolar hoe
Fuck around, tell the truth and a lie
Down south lil' bitch, 5'2" real thick
Rock a little gold lil' tooth on the side

[Chorus]
Yeah my name G Herbo, I like nasty bitches
I like classy bitches, lil' fake sassy bitches
I got ratchet bitches, bossed up bad bitches
Foreign swag bitches, Birkin bag bitches
Ion't want that stupid bitch, bougie, stay on basic shit
All that makeup shit, man I hate that shit
Why yo' eyebrows fake? Bitch erase that shit
Bitch I’m high as fuck, I’m just tryin' fuck

[Verse 2]
Bitches love me, try to hug me but I’m not a puppy
Wanna be wifey soon as they fuck me but I’m not a hubby
When inside, they love to ride me but I’m not a Huffy
Hit her city, let her suck me maybe if she lucky
My lil' MILF bitch got a body, that I call her Buffy
Just met a lil' bitch wit a lot of kids, I call her auntie
Yo bitch hand always in front of me, begging for some money
She know she can’t get nothing from me so she ask me bluntly
Yeah my name G Herbo, I like nasty bitches
Might meet her in the hood, her lil sassy bitches
I like classy bitches, I met her at Bergdorf
Compliment her skirt, made her take her shirt off

[Chorus]
Yeah my name G Herbo, I like nasty bitches
I like classy bitches, lil' fake sassy bitches
I got ratchet bitches, bossed up bad bitches
Foreign swag bitches, Birkin bag bitches
Ion't want that stupid bitch, bougie, stay on basic shit
All that makeup shit, man I hate that shit
Why yo' eyebrows fake? Bitch erase that shit
Bitch I’m high as fuck, I’m just tryin' fuck
