[Intro]
Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways
You're telling me I'm silly
It's no fun in the old days
I'm such a romantic
I never remember how things really happen
I guess you're attractive
Or something

[Verse 2]
Live in the moment
That's what they tell me
But what ever happened
To when you would hold me
And hold me
And hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girlfriend or girl, that's a friend?
It's easy just to pretend
That we don't have something real

[Chorus]
It's just how we feel
We feel
Oh, it's just how we feel
How we feel

[Bridge]
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right
I'm feeling something right

[Verse 3]
I wanna be the one you think about at night
And I wanna be the one that you would put up a fight for
You know that I adore
That even when you're bored
I'd buy you anything and everything I can't afford
