...my body, my physique
Told my peeps, told 'em all, "It's time to eat" (Hmm)
No, no please, can't, no don't do that, we want peace
They'll run around, touchin' on me, playin', they like to leach

I got you and ain't no pleasin', lay they life down for the cause
I got blue ones goin' hard, I got heart
