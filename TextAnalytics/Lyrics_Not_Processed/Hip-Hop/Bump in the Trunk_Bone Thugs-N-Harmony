[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
You feelin the wrath that'll rump then bump, in your trunk
You feelin the wrath that'll rump then bump, in your trunk
You feelin the wrath that'll rump then bump, in your trunk (in your trunk)
In your trunk (in your trunk) in your trunk
You feelin the wrath that'll rump then bump, in your trunk
You feelin the wrath that'll rump then bump, in your trunk
You feelin the wrath that'll rump then bump, in your trunk (in your trunk)
In your trunk (in your trunk) in your trunk trunk trunk trunk

[Layzie Bone]
Nigga feel that beat in your chest when your leanin and swervin
Bass in your back, you feel it, you heard it
Hand on the wheel, no need to be nervous
Ride with a G everything'll be perfect
Put it down, put it all on the +Surface+
Dirty as we ride, it'll all be worth it
'Til the wheels fall off, nigga that's the purpose
Nothin but the best cause we deserve it
They know when I'm comin
Cause niggas can hear me before they can see me
And they can't believe it cause I'm bumpin Eazy-E
And they just seen me on TV
Navigate through the streets dawg
Keep it real to the beat that ain't no secret
Jump outta the Jeep car
Run up in the liquor store hit the freezer
Grab a O, Gold, 
and like my four-oh
My flow so cold
, I gotta have some
Turn the music back up to the maximum
Them niggas hatin on us but I laugh at 'em
I got a 9-millimeter that'll get me to the trunk
If I make it to the trunk I'mma pop that trunk
Y'all already know comin outta the trunk
Is a AK who, with a 12-gauge what?

We back with a vengeance, cause rap took a strippin without us
Let's be honest, this industry's now over-crowded, forgot us
Nigga your time up, go back to practice, sign with your life and sign up
If niggas is lookin for hits hit Swizz up, nigga he comin to find us
And we ain't hard to find, been right here all the time
That bling got y'all all blind, these niggas ain't raw as I
So don't make me kill ya
Don't try to battle me cause ain't none of you niggas skilled enough
(Skilled enough) I'm sick of these niggas
They killin me, really they wanna be Thugs
Everybody wanna roll like us
Smoke blunts cause we pump, off in your trunk
Them niggas get hypnotized
Run up as soon as they feel the vibe
They never been on a realer ride
Just runnin up, let's turn it up 'til they know how to

[Hook]

[Wish Bone]
'Fore the liquor store close in a rush turn it up
Let it drop, now nigga let's roll (roll)
Gotta fill up, with a drink of
Anything that bang or that roll up
Gotta choose what I listen too
Cause it ain't that much that I'm feelin, ooh
Everybody talkin violence
Take a life, live they been through
I love that gangsta music, bump nothin but Thugster music
Except when I lay down and slow down, that lovin music
No pretender get in ya, Thugs runnin through it
The truest, we still hear they love how we do it
We do it THUGSTER!
Outta line cross mine, yes Thugsters really RUSH YA!
Bang ya brains with thangs, never RUN AWAY!
Any day I'm here to stay, we love to play
Bone got that feel good, pop it in, listen to real rappin
