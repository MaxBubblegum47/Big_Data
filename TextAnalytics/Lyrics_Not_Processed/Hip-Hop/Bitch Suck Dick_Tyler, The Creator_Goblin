[Intro: Jasper Dolphin]
Oh, shit (Swag)
Three icy ass niggas from Odd Future doin' some crazy shit (Bitch)
By the way, we do punch bitches, huh

[Verse 1: Jasper Dolphin]
I'm a swagging, bitch (Swag), I'm iced out (Iced out)
Oh, you mad, bitch? (Bitch) 'Cause I'm laying on the couch (Woo)
Smoke a blunt, fuck a bitch in the butt, I'm bossing (Bow, bow)
Don't give a fuck, I never roll Slauson
I'm fly, bitch, I should poke you in your eye, bitch
Got the burner, bitch, bow, bow (Bow)
You dead, bitch, I'm hot as fuck
I ain't never cold, but I'm icy, bitch (Woo)

[Chorus: Jasper Dolphin]
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick (Bow, bow, bow)
My bitch suck dick like (What) she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick (Bow, bow)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Got the bops in the house, socking bitches in they mouth (Bitch)
See my neck? Iced the fuck out (I'm getting money, nigga)
She at the fucking mall, forty bitches on my nutsack
I pulled up on a mothafuckin' unicorn (I'm getting ponies, nigga)
Wolf Gang, nigga
Scream that 'til they motherfucking show me death
Golf Wang, nigga
Free Earl, better show some motherfucking respect
All this ice around my neck, all this ice around my dick
Gun to her head, make your bitch massage my shoulders

[Chorus: Jasper Dolphin]
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick (Bow, bow, bow)
My bitch suck dick like (What) she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick (Bow, bow)

[Verse 3: Travis Taco]
Shut up, bitch (Shut up, bitch), suck my dick (Suck my nuts)
You fucking bop (Bitch), you better swallow it
I got a chain with a fuckin' platinum plaque on it
Is that a hundred dollar bill? I'll shit on it
I bought a fucking whale, 'cause I'm ballin' (Ow)
Your bitch work for me, she my dick washer
Swag on my dick, 30 thousand million, nigga

[Chorus: Jasper Dolphin]
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick (Goddamn)

[Verse 4: Jasper Dolphin]
You bopping, bitch, (Question mark) you like this dick?
We all know why, 'cause you's a boppin' bitch (Bow, bow, bow)
I got the burner, I pop you in your lip (Bow, bow)
Zoom-zoom, yeah, I'm going fast, bitch
I'm loud as fuck (I'm loud as fuck), I'm ignorant (Ignorant)
Punch a bitch in her mouth just for talkin' shit
You lurking, bitch? Well, I see that shit
Once again, I gotta punch a bitch in her shit
I'm icy, bitch, don't look at my wrist (At my wrist)
Because if you do (If you do), I might blind you bitch (Bitch)
Mount Everest ain't fucking with my fucking wrist
Fuck global warming, this the Ice Age, bitch (Bitch suck dick)

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator and Jasper Dolphin, Tyler, the Creator, Jasper Dolphin]
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Yo, yo, Jasper, Taco, y'all my niggas, man
I love y'all niggas, I'm sorry
[Gunshot]
Ow! What the fuck?!
