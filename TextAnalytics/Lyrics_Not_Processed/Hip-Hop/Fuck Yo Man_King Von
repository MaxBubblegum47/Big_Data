[Chorus]
Bitch, fuck your nigga
Ho, fuck his feelings
You say you stayin'
See, ho, you trippin'
See, I'm a killer
But I got feelings
I catch you with him
I just might kill him

[Verse 1]
It feel like I'm doing the most
I like you, I'm letting you know
They been running from me they whole life
But I ain't into chasing no hoes
See, I cut this shit and just go
If I like you, I'm fucking you slow
Don't be scared 'cause I keep these guns 'round me
Never know who might come through the door
See, it started one day by the store
I was lurking, you know how that go
They was lacking, they know we at war
Hit the corner, I'm letting it blow
Boom, he fell, can't get up no more
I'm running, my forehead was soaked
I hear sirens, boy, they getting close
Don't  know how much far I can go
Told God forgive me, I'm wrong
Looked up, saw a bitch at the door
She waved, said, "Boy, come on"
I'm so happy, she don't even know
Made it in, then I hit the floor
Looked up, she was locking the door
Asked me do I still got my pole?
I looked down like, "You already know"
Look, my name Von, I know
And I'm from the O, I know
But I ain't do shit, I know
Don't worry, you good, they gone
This bitch was bad for sure
I gave her some racks for a coat
Asked her do she live alone?
She say, "Nah, he on his way home"

[Chorus]
Bitch, fuck your nigga
Ho, fuck his feelings
You say you stayin'
See, ho, you trippin'
See, I'm a killer
But I got feelings
I catch you with him
I just might kill him

[Verse 2]
We been talkin', now we gettin' close
Her nigga a lame and he broke
When we fuckin', I love how you moan
You get T'd when they play my songs
My birthday the code to her phone
"Is he gone?" "Yeah, come on"
She call me when he not at home
So deep that I'm touchin' her soul
Now it feel like you leading me on
Got me all in they bed, this bitch wrong
I told her just leave him, she won't
I don't understand, what's wrong?
Bitch, stop playin' games, we grown
Looked up, heard, "Baby, I'm home"
Looked back, I was clutching my pole
She tellin' me, "No, Von, you wrong"

[Chorus]
Bitch, fuck your nigga
Ho, fuck his feelings
You say you stayin'
See, ho, you trippin'
See, I'm a killer
But I got feelings
I catch you with him
I just might kill him
Bitch, fuck your nigga
Ho, fuck his feelings
You say you stayin'
See, ho, you trippin'
See, I'm a killer
But I got feelings
I catch you with him
I just might kill him
