[Verse 1]
Watch him ride into the sunset
He'd have the little fat guy
Right along his side
Echoing off the canyon, Hey Cisco
From Pancho 'n' pretty soon
The black sombrero would reply
Hey Pancho what's happening mi amigo
It's getting somewhere near the end
This winding trail
When we've raced around the corner
For the final dusty time
Mr Renaldo 'n' Carillo's
Going to jail

[Chorus]
What they doing to my friend
What they doing to my man
Don't matter when
I'll stay to the end
Hey Cisco
Let's go out in style
We're going down together [3x]

[Verse 2]
Can't open no more supermarkets
Duncan's sombrero's hanging
Up there with his guns
Some cigarro sucking slag
Under a chip Hollywood chandelier
Says 'Cisco, Kid you know
Your day is done
Let me know how you are doing
Mr Renaldo
If you need me I could be

[Chorus]
