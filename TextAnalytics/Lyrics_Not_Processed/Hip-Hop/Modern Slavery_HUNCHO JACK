[Intro: Quavo & Otis Redding]
Yeah
It's earlier in the morning
Mmm, mmm, mmm (Buddah Bless this beat)
Since I—

[Chorus: Quavo, Travis Scott & Otis Redding]
All these damn chains, modern slavery (Ice)
But this ain't 1800 so they pay me (Cash)
Uh, yeah, shaking my demons off (Shake 'em)
Dippin' my dreams in sauce (Dreams)
Never been food for sharks (Nope)
Wrist like fins on dolphins (Since I—, splash)
Pop hella bands and I'm paid (Oh yeah)
Whip got a switch, I go brainless (Oh yeah)
Sip after sip, I feel painless (Oh yeah, since I—)

[Verse: Travis Scott, Quavo & Otis Redding]
Yeah, yeah, do it one time for team (Yeah)
Burn it like gasoline (It's lit)
Downing these jelly beans (Alright)
Diamonds they frolicking (Ice)
Red and blue matching drugs
Did 'em both just because (Pop it)
They hoodie and maskin' up (Nah)
They the real Robin Hoods (Yeah)
Yeah, if I, let my
Gang out, bow down (Gang)
Come 'round, gun you down
Hunt down (Pew pew), hunt down (Shoot)
Rampage, campaign, champagne (Ayy), I gain
Decades of no pain (Hoo)
At this age, they fugaz' (Woo)
Who did you thought you was (Who?)
Get 'em knocked off for dubs (Pew)
Sit in the trap with bugs (Trappin')
Walk in the lab with scrubs (Ayy)
Niggas tried to count us out (No)
Fuck you thought this was (Huh)
Up like a coffee mug (Up)
Save your salt for slugs (Save it, since I—)
Hot on the block, you told 12, got the drop
Rubber bands and they pop, so we weigh up the knots
Cuban link cost a lot, Houston cred with a lot
Let it fall from the top, she gon' bend, she gon' pop, oh (Since I—)

[Chorus: Quavo & Travis Scott]
All these damn chains, modern slavery (Ice)
But this ain't 1800 so they pay me (Cash)
Uh, yeah, shaking my demons off (Shake 'em)
Dippin' my dreams in sauce (Dreams)
Never been food for sharks (Nope)
Wrist like fins on dolphins (Splash)
Pop hella bands and I'm paid (Oh yeah)
Whip got a switch, I go brainless (Oh yeah)
Sip after sip, I feel painless (Oh yeah)
