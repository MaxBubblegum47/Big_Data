[Chorus: Flo Rida]
So many girls in here, where do I begin? (Oh-oh)
I seen this one, I’m bout to go in (Oh-oh)
Then she said, "I’m here with my friends" (Oh-oh)
She got me thinking, and that's when I said
"Where them girls at, girls at?" (Woo)
"Where them girls at, girls at?" (Woo)
"Where them girls at, girls at?" (Woo)
So go get them, we can all be friends (Woo)

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hey, bring it on, baby, all your friends
You’re the shit and I love that body, body
You wanna ball, let's mix it, I swear you’re good
I won't tell nobody (Body)
You got a BFF, I wanna see that girl, it’s all women invited (Vited)
Hair do’s and nails, that Louie, Chanel all up in the party
Presidents in my wallet, no rules, I’m 'bout it
Blow the whistle for the hotties
I got it, shawty, it’s never too much, can’t be doing too much
Ten to one of me, I can handle that love
Outta of my reach, we can all get buzz
Holla 'cause I’m free, no matter, it’s no rush

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & 
Flo Rida
 & 
Both

So many boys in here, where do I begin? (Oh-oh)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo! It's PB! PB! 
Who's Peabo Bryson?
Two years ago I renewed my license
Anyway, why’d I start my verse like that?!
You can suck a dick or you can suck on a ballsack
No, no, I don’t endorse that, pause that, abort that
Just the other day mi go a-London, saw dat, kids down hyde street
Paparazzi, all dat
Hey hey, what can I say?
Day day day da-day day
Coming through the club, all the girls in the back of me
This ain't football, why the fuck they tryna tackle me?
Really, I peeped dude at the bar like really
Looking like he wanna good time like really
Said he had got a friend for my home girl Lily, Lily, Lily, Lily
