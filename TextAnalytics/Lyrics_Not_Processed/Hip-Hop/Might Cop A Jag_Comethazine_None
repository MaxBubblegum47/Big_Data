[Chorus]
I fucked that bitch, now that bitch don't even matter, uh
Pull out that scope, make him shit, he need Pampers
Fuck nigga talkin' that shit 'til he see me
I pull up with pistol on me like police
Wrist shine like fireflies, yours roly poly
I cannot fuck with that bitch 'cause she hoey
I just wan' fuck that lil' bitch for the night
She think I'ma dog her, told that bitch, "You're right."

[Verse]
Roll up the Fronto, make sure it's rolled tight
Keep the strap on me, but I'm not a dyke
Can't pick just one bitch, so I make these hoes fight
Easter pink my drink, that shit get me right
OG cookies have me high like a kite
If that boy lurk, lay him down like it's nighttime
I fucked that bitch through her skirt and her nightgown
Then took her purse and finessed all her cash
Then hopped in the El Camino, I did the dash
Blowin' money like casino, I make it fast
Bitch Demi Lovato with a way fatter ass
Ballin' like I hit the lotto, might cop a Jag

[Bridge]
Ooh, might cop a Jag
I'm ballin' like I hit the lotto, might cop a Jag
Ooh, might cop a Jag
Ballin' like I hit the lotto, might cop a Jag

[Interlude]
Damn, son, where'd you find this?

[Chorus]
I fucked that bitch, now that bitch don't even matter, uh
Pull out that scope, make him shit, he need Pampers
Fuck nigga talkin' that shit 'til he see me
I pull up with pistol on me like police
Wrist shine like fireflies, yours roly poly
I cannot fuck with that bitch 'cause she hoey
I just wan' fuck that lil' bitch for the night
She think I'ma dog her, told that bitch, "You're right."
