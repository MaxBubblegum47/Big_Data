We took the p out of paradise
Just to produce this hell
And all we're going to leave behind is this decaying putrid smell
We've lived in this world
Seen her used and abused
That's why god is singing the blues
They felled a great oak over there
They filled a duck pond over here
We've got a glass and concrete monster now that feeds and caters to
Our fears
Maybe it's too late
To spoil another view
That's why god is singing the blues
Forgive us father
For we know not what we do
Blame it on each other
And in the name of you
Forgive us mother
For the pain we caused
We destroyed what's yours
That's why papa's singing the blues
Polluted all the oceans
Pulped all the trees
Plagued by chronic boredom
We blew a hole in the atmosphere
We tore out her heart
Left her battered and bruised
That's why god is singing the blues
Forgive us father
For we know not what we do
Blame it on each other
And in the name of you
Forgive us mother
For the pain we caused
We destroyed what's yours
That's why papa's singing the blues
You may believe in evolution
You may believe in god's great creation
The only thing we know for sure
We got a man made situation
We turned this whole world
Into a dying zoo
That's why god is singing the blues
You better live on your feet
Than die on your knees
I stole that from some graffiti
Lord have mercy please
Living in this babylon
Keeps us confused
That's why god is singing the blues
