[Verse 1]
Long nights with you
When the worst gets said
But it ends in bed and bad attitude
I overreact but you throw it back and

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's so hard to understand
We both wanna stop it but we can't

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'mma give you all my blood, sweat, tears, ah-ooh
And when it hurts I'm gonna stay right here, ah-ooh
Think I'm gonna make it, don't know how to say it
I just wanna die with you
So baby you can take my blood, sweat, tears, ah-ooh
