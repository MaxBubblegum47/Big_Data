[Intro: Kevin Abstract, Henock Sileshi & Matt Champion]
Y'all know this is not a game (Uh, yeah)
It's Technical Difficulties
In the building (Yeah), in the mix at Club Kaufman
Represent the real
Technical Difficulties
Yeah, don't sit out
Go through somethin', blind new, don't got no new tools for now, they bounce it out
A-T-L, we ridin' 'fore the dawgs come out, bouncin' out
What am I supposed to do when we feel down and out?
Wonderful, hate that a bitch standby, feel so—

[Interlude: Henock Sileshi & Kevin Abstract]
L-L-L-Listen
Drop the drop
It's Technical Difficulties
You already know, yeah

[Verse 1: Matt Champion & Merlyn Wood]
Pair with me when the sun go down
Everybody lately wanna hunt shit down
But I all wanna do is just shut shit down
Back and forth, you gotta cut it out
Ain't in the mood to really argue now
What if they come up and throw you out?
Ain't tryna scrap right now
But I got your back right now
Small problems is all you involved with so don't be petty, shit, yeah
Don't be petty, don't be petty
We can talk it out, but it's hard when you are not near
Need you near, I need you near

[Chorus: bearface]
All that you wanted, oh, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more
All that you wanted, oh, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night (Yeah)
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Don't trust nobody, don't want nobody else
Love nobody else, no-nobody else
This is how the party start, real players enter
Lover, you don't love me yet, what you doin' later?
Floor filled with girls, pretty liquor on my sneaker
Shawty so full of sugar, I'm so glad I met ya
I wanna risk that for you
You can spend my time and my money too
There isn't one thing that I wouldn't do
If you was in danger, to get to you

[Chorus: bearface]
All that you wanted, oh, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more
All that you wanted, oh, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night (Yeah)
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more

[Verse 3: Joba]
Somethin' like fine wine, gotta sip it slow
Takin' my damn time, 'cause it taste right
Tow the fine line, white-knuckled and ready
Wide-eyed, so worth it and perfect
Guess I deserve it, quench my thirst in a drought
Savour every sip, all it takes is a call
I'll be there for anything at all
Prepare, you know I hold it down

[Chorus: bearface]
All that you wanted, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more
All that you wanted, I'ma give it all night
All night, all night, all night, all night (Yeah)
And it's you that I wanted, I'ma take it all night
And tell me, you want it some more, tell me, you want it some more

[Outro: Jabari Manwa]
It's all night, yeah, I'm at your door
It's been a long night (Yeah), I caught your feeling for
For a long time (Yeah), you waitin' for it
For a long while, I know you need it some more
It's all night, yeah, I'm at your door
Yeah, it's been a long night, I caught your feeling for
For a long time, you waitin' for it
For a long while, I know you need it some more
