[Verse 1]
Drive this foreign fast and I'm not crashing it
Got a pound of gas in my back seat and I'm not stashing it
Fuck you, talk like you be gettin' it, you ain't having it
Niggas talking like they be having chips, they ain't having it
Stick that's on me, bitch, I will not pull it 'cause I'm stashing it
Fuck you, niggas mad at me 'cause I'm not asking 'em
Niggas mad at me 'cause I'm rolling up like a massacre
Probably fuck ya treesh, tell her papa like the acronym

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, yeah, got me feeling fucked up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh-ooh, yeah, feeling like my luck's up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh-ooh, yeah, money, know I gotta, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh-ooh, live with no regrets now, no, no
It's like ooh-ooh, feeling like I fucked up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh-ooh, feeling like my luck's up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh-ooh, yeah, feeling like I fucked up yeah, yeah
It's like ooh-ooh, feeling like my luck's up, yeah, yeah
It's like, yeah

[Verse 2]
Daddy got one, no, I would not roll it if it is the mids
Purple dropper but my shit is cherry
'Cause it's Hi-Tech red
Talking 'bout something
I gotta change or something
Said I'd change or something
I'm up one
Said I'd change or something
Change the game or something
Give a fuck
Life a party, bitch, nobody got my back
Got my brothers
But they distant 'cause them niggas hold me back
I'm just different, I'm just gifted, they like 'why you go like that?'
Keep it lifting with precision
Know I bang it till it's track

[Chorus]
It's like ooh-ooh, yeah, feeling like I fucked up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh-ooh, yeah, feeling like my luck's up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh-ooh, yeah, feeling like I fucked up, yeah, yeah
It's like ooh-ooh, yeah, feeling like my luck's up, yeah, yeah
It's like, yeah
