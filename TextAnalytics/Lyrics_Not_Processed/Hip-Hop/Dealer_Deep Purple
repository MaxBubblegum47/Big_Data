[Verse 1]
If you fool around
With the dealer
Remember soon
You'll have to pay, yeah
He'll creep behind you
Like a hunter
Just to steal your soul away
I don't want no one
Messing with my woman
But just the same
I don't see nobody
Fooling with you
If you're snow blind
Madonna can hold you
But if you don't understand
There is nothing she can do for you

[Chorus]
Running from the dealer
Trying to save your soul

[Verse 2]
I can feel the fire
Coming from inside you
I know what it's like
Because I've been burned before
Isn't no mercy in the hunger
You're a fool to yourself
Because your dealer keeps you begging for more

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In the beginning all you wanted
Was the calm before the storm
If the bluebird plays the eagle, yeah
He finds his song will turn to stone, dealer
