[Verse 2: Trippie Redd]
(Yeah)
With a bad bitch, flirting in the hills
In this Maybach, man, I'm swervin' in the hills, yeah
Had to lift up my curtains in the hills
It look perfect in the hills
And if a nigga test me, commit murder in the hills
The devil's working, hella serpents in the hills
The birds is chirping in the hills
It make me nervous in the hills
'Cause that's the reason why I'm swervin' in the hills
Or why I'm hurtin' in the hills, lose my purpose in the hills

[Chorus: blackbear & Trippie Redd]
It's no service in the hills
I can't hit you back (Yeah), you gon' have to chill (Have to chill)
Tryna make another mil' (Make a mil')
I just can't relax (Yeah), I might take a pill
I've been way up, got my bread up
Talkin' like you hungry, bitch, I'm fed up, yeah (I'm so fed)
It's no service in the hills
I can't hit you back (Yeah), you gon' have to chill (Yeah)
