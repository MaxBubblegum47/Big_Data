[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Many men has met his fate, murder I premeditate
The world is low, the devil waits, so I stay high as heaven gates
See I'm on it everyday, minutes never go to waste
If ain't no profit on the way then we cannot negotiate
Scripture tatts for holy sakes, who's telling what the Lord will say
Until that day, I'll be tunnel vision on the paper chase
Odd Future, fuck your feelings, check the score we fuckin' winnin'
Check the list we in the building, stupid swag, Paris Hilton
More potential, you's a liar, step up we will crucify ya
Head first, yea it's going down like a scuba diver
Need the fire, I'll supply ya, put the hire on the block
Swag on deck, if you need it I be overstocked

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I'm a brother man with a swagger from the motherlands
It tugs my hands and rubs my glans, I'm ill as fuck, bitch fuck your mans
Chingy chong, I'm in Japan, Chinch and Chong wrapped in seran
Keep the bong hash in my canister, I'm headed where it's handed first
Domo rollin' up, Left Brain already smokin'
You smell that loud ounce? Mary Jane has already spoken
My shades on, bitch I'm Loc'ing, no need for aggravations
Cause a fake nigga and his death bed will be fuckin' collaboratin'
Kush escaped without a roller, high roller, no time for strollers
Made it stoned because I'm workin' over
Too many posers tryin' to ride my boa-constrict
I'm pretty sure Tyler will represent it
I fell asleep before you bitch niggas present it
I'm fuckin' authentic, remember it, you motherfuckers pretending

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
Me and Lego just skated the bowl
Next thing you know wildin' out at Watch the Throne
I had a dead phone so I gave that little nigga my cam
He snapped that shit, the motherfuckers went HAM
Like Miss Piggy cunt around Kermit
I'm like how many fucks can I get a day?
Fuck respect, I'd rather hang myself on the wall with a noose on neck
Before I change to fit in your box, I'll make sure I cannot fit in the house
And I hate genres, fuck hip hop
I'd rather search and cop hi-top flip flops in the middle of the winter
Y'all like "fuck them kids," like a weird babysitter mindset
My dignity, I'm still trying to find it but I lost it somewhere in Austin
In a creek with Dawson and this vegan bitch tryin' to eat my sausage
That sounds awesome
Fuck these parties, I'm real awkward
I stand there, I don't know what to do man
I'd rather be at home with my crew and my new rooms, staring at my brand new MoonMan
Listening to MF Doom and Wooh Da Kid and Brick Squad 1017
Shout out to Waka, rest in peace Slim
Golf Wang motherfuckin' triple six we is 3 twins
Free my little nigga Sweatshirt
Gang name stitched into my sweatshirt
Bow down until your motherfuckin' neck hurt
Respect me. Do we run shit? Nigga, yes indeed
Cheech and Chong, I don't need a bong
But I do have friends who got weed that's strong
I need a tree house, air hockey, ping pong, a mini ramp
Leanin' a tramp on a trampoline
(Have you heard the end of the Window?)
Nigga fuck the team
Hey, I'm just playin', I love you niggas
I hate these niggas, fuck these niggas
Fuck everybody who doubted me
The only ones I care about's the ones that surround me
Odd Future!

[Outro: Tyler the Creator]
Fuck all you industry niggas man
Y'all see me at parties, start comin' up sayin'
"We must collab" I don't fuck with none of you niggas
All y'all can suck my motherfuckin' dick
Fuck all you labels
Fuck every fuckin' DJ I hope y'all don't play none of my shit
Suck my motherfuckin' dick
And don't come up to me at the next event
I don't want your fuckin' number, your business card
Fuck your company, I'm not performin' at none of your shit
Don't ask for my fuckin' manager's email
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
Golf Wang, Free Earl nigga
Fuck Steve Harvey
