[Chorus 2X: LaReece + Krayzie]
Yeah I got a couple cribs, so what, nigga
Rollin sittin on dub, dubs, nigga
But I don't have to wear no diamonds to shine
Don't need none of that cause I'm Bone, Bone

[Layzie Bone]
Look at me tipsy sippin on Grey Goose, finna let loose cause I can
Fuckin with people that's off in the crowd, nigga you know me, I'm the man
Cleveland, is the city, where the Thuggstaz get down
Just come to my town and ask around, they tell you who the rawest in town
Cause I'm a +Thug By Nature+, strictly for the paper
Ain't nobody steppin to Steve (B-O-N-E)
I come with the ones, I come with the guns
I come with them things that go bang
It's still an +Everyday Thang+, for me to let my nuts hang
You want a performance, where's the ticket?
If the price right we can kick it
Like a lick, I'ma hit it, party on I gots to get it
Keep them foxy women baggin it up (baggin it up)
While them haters stayin actin up (actin up)
You flashin what? I'm flashin flossy nuts
Girl if you comin take a ride with me
And if you ridin with me, sit back recline in yo' seat
Cause in the world where I'm from the sun always shine
And even though a nigga don't want it baby the world is mine, so c'mon

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
I'm out of my mind with the ski mask, chains and gloves
Waitin for niggas to come out of the club (I hit 'em up!)
Give me the dubs for my niggas that bang and slang drugs
We fuckin them niggas up, ain't no love for Bone Thugs?
Nigga fuck y'all! Y'all bitches used up
It's business as usual, I ain't takin no shit, from none of ya
Wanna see my niggas with no, money huh?
Since a nigga young think he rollin with dummies, oh you a sucka for
That's why I pitch ya bitch, flippin that activist of freedom
And I'm Bone Thug too, make 'em meet 'em
No podium, just a pistol and nails to leave quickly
Youngest Bone nigga, 7th Sign mastermind, y'all get wit me

[Chorus]

[Krayzie Bone]
We steppin inside the party, Mardi Gradi
Now give me a shot of Bacardi, let it get up in my body
Make my body body rock rock - I'm lookin at rappers so full of shit
I'ma just get up against the wall dawg and pull on my dick
Tell the DJ don't even tell 'em we in here (shhh) we on the low
No thuggin in V.I.P. for me and my niggas, we on the flo'
C'mon heyyy - we fin' to get this party started right
Could you put some Thug music on?
Like Bone Bone to get a nigga vibin in my zone, hey!
I hear the same shit song after song, man
How many times is you gon' tell us about you ballin, huh?
How many rhymes is you gon' write like that before you fall off?
That's why we back and we fin' to bomb in this bitch
Ring the alarm, better be gone when we mob up in here
So you better get with the Thugs or shut the fuck up and back up off me
And I don't need no diamonds to shine, nigga I floss me, what?

[Chorus]

[Krayzie Bone]
Niggas talkin loud (uh-huh, uh-huh)
But they ain't really sayin nothin (not a damn thing, damn thing)
Niggas talkin loud (uh-huh, uh-huh)
But they ain't really sayin nothin (not a damn thing, damn thing)

[Chorus]
