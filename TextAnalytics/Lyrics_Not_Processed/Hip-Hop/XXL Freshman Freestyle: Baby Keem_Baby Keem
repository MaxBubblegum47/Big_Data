[Verse]
I don't go outside no more, I stay remote
Keep my spirit clean from all the demon folk
Kiss my niece, then I make some green tea
Just closed another deal before she fell asleep
That's meditation, hydration, both'll do
That's good pussy, good books, good view
So what's the inside joke? What's the inside joke?
You will never know, that's the Morse code
Felt so lost, gettin' caught, red-handed on spot
Thought I was good in them white K-Swisses
My momma had puttin' pen on box
Back when my Velcro straps was fadin'
Grandma's on the housin' list, we grew impatient
Damn, did the government stop their payments?
Hidin' in the closet once UPS came in
Ayy, I can't help but feel neglected
Changin' up your schedule, your calendar refreshin'
Time pass and we move on, nobody says shit
So how am I 'posed to act when my morals won't respect it?
And how you 'posed to act when your feelings ain't protected?
I'm cashin' checks just to get some neck and some necklaces
So what's next? War and turbulence, I'm prayin' on this plane
Success, got a taste of it, never was the same
