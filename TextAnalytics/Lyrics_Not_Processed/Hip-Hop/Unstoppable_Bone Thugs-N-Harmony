[ad libs for first 21 seconds]

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone] + (Wish Bone)
(You niggas can't stop me) I'm cockin a Glock
(You motherfuckers can't stop me) I'm poppin the Glock
And the cop tails for the guerillas on the block
For skinny niggas like myself, artillery shops as well, yeah

[Bizzy Bone]
(You think I give a fuck?)
You think I give a fuck if you don't like me nigga?
Put 'em up in a club and fight me
I'm sorry that I'm just so fuckin exciting
Steadily cordial like this killa 'posed to
And I wish you would really try to come test me
You break bread with niggas that know you, I can show you
Slowly rollin like these cuts from old school
Cookin it up just like it's soul food
Fuck all y'all, I never did know you
Bring the ProTools, stack it on up
And little thugs that I console to
Never leave your house without, keepin it up
To the head that is, you don't know what mad is?
Couple of bodies under my belt and with mad kids for self protectin
Don't know (bitch) and keep my hands on a little bit of solo shit
It's Bone Thugs forever cause I know where home is

[Chorus] - 2X

[Layzie Bone]
What you thought a nigga'd be up and gone
Fly by night, no longer Bone, strictly hype
Nigga better think twice
Cause all of these haters ain't even seen the light
Nigga we can conquer anything, and the mission always complete
Be that little nigga when you see me
But a dog out in these streets (roof, roof)
And I gets my money, I bring home the bacon
Seven or better that's what I'm makin
Better check the reputation, nigga get dealt with, frontin and hatin
See I'm polishin, plus I'm cool, yeah I'm a thug and yeah I'm a fool
I love the game and I love the rules
If you cross the line I'ma flex these two's
And nigga ooh, if I do it's for my children
If you're feelin like I'm feelin then you probably gon' see a million
Thug nation, fuck these doubters, yeah they said it, "He'll never make it
He's runnin wild and doin this and doin that, he'll never make it"
Who gets the last laugh now, look at me now countin this money
Them the same niggas today, that can't get nothin from me
To all of them blind, hatin congratulatin
Niggas there's really no time wastin
Penetratin and elevatin, believe us we them niggas up there waitin

[Chorus] - 2X

[Wish Bone]
Oh, oh, oh now look it's a miracle (ain't that a bitch)
Y'all know that Bone's gon' pop, ten years and still we blow
Just admit that we rock, all night long
You know we keep it thug and still harmonize these songs (songs)
But don't get it twisted, we thug and we real with it
They feel that we flip and we deal with it
Ain't gotta like it, better live with it
Just trust me, better live with it
Now think about you when you was me wearin my shoes on yo' feet
Now think again cause that can never be
I can never be a hater with the hand that was dealt to me
And it seems like I've always been down
And I can't take that, rather take that 'fore I go back that route
You see one nigga on the news, wonderin what did he do
When they tell you, you be like, "Ooh, that nigga's through"
But they don't know me
Been blessed with all my thugs and all this harmony
You know we can't be stopped, we rollin past the cops
Plus all you haters, the finger's all you got
Fuck y'all!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Krayzie Bone]
I ain't got nothin to say to a hater
As soon as he run up I give him a POW!
Put him in the pound with the rest of them niggas
Who thought they could run up and fuck with me now in 2 thou'
We fuckin around with the convicts, breakin 'em up at the county
Now I got nothin but killas around me
Fallin in proudly, organized but rowdy
They fearin us, because of the shit they been hearin about us
They say that them niggas got ripped with the knowledge
And we got a nation of niggas screamin "Thug Power!"
Them niggas ain't think we was comin back on some real
Political militant workin the fields while these bustas stay in the crib
Execution! Bloody murda murda, murder them all
Kill 'em all, all, get yo' shit nigga get in the car
If you ridin willin to die for this, really tryin to survive in this
Get up and fuck up your rivalries, you funny you even know what time it is
I'm one of the soldiers, warriors willin and ready to die for the cause
If it's war that's what we came for
That's why I brought my dawgs for all of y'all
Gauges will be blazin, watch I shock and shake the worrrrrld
Watch the drama unfold, I'm unstoppable (stoppable)

[Chorus] - 2X
