[Intro]
Sheck Jesus
Fuck it
Sheck Jesus, Sheck, Sheck Jesus
Sheck Jesus, Sheck, Sheck Jesus
Sheck Jesus, Sheck, Sheck Jesus (Mudboy, Mudboy)
Sheck Jesus, Sheck, Sheck Jesus (Mudboy, Mud-Mudboy, Mudboy)
Sheck Jesus, Sheck, Sheck Jesus (Mudboy, Mud-Mudboy, Mudboy)
Sheck Jesus, Sheck, Sheck Jesus
Sheck Jesus (Jesus, bitch)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
These niggas ain't fuckin' with me (Hell no)
I just been so hot that I've been movin' lowkey
Put Prius in my blunt, ain't smokin' no more O.G
It was fun and games, now it's back to controlling
'Cause... (Bitch)... I'm a fuckin' star (Huh?)
Dead niggas, all up in my sock (Bitch)
Dead niggas all up on my car (Huh?)
Anger in my thoughts, no trust up in my heart
Told my fuckin' niggas, "It's to the fuckin' top"
Put it on my niggas, I can't stop goin' hard
I said, "Pull up to my body shop and get a paint job, bitch
Or don't call this mechanic for the face job, bitch"
I hate to be explicit, I need FaceTime, bitch
Why I say bitch so much? Let me explain it

[Interlude]
It's the only word...
Where I can feel and hear all my anger
It don't got nothin' to do with like bitches
It's just-
Bitch! Bitch!

[Verse 2]
I live a, I live a MudBoy lifestyle, killers on speed dial
Don't fuck with Sheck Wes, we gon' break a ki' down
Call that bitch 2K, how she blow me out
Shoot it on the 4K, might just put the leak out
Hot boy lifestyle, pull up with them thangs out
Nigga, I'm from New York, outside where we hang out
I just sip that poison, niggas sippin' tea now
I don't do the gossip, gossip, that's for females
Ugh, you can cop it, but never for retail
Prices, couldn't top it, flip it, profit resale
I like real bad bitches, I like dreads with pink nails
I'm young and misguided, but I'm so into detail

[Chorus]
Legend like Kobe
 (Gas is my cologne)
Scrappy like Sprewell
 (Good fragrance what we smell)
Sheck Wes eight time (Packs comin' in)
Sheck like Kobe

[Outro]

Na-na-na-na, na-na

I was wanted, wanted
Bitch!
