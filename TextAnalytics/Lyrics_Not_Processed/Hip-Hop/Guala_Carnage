I like the "guala guala" part
Ayy, see, yeah, you hear them diamonds, bitch (Yeah)

I'm, I'm worth, I'm worth forty five million (Yeah)

He got more money than me 'cause he's white

[Pre-Chorus: Thirty Rack]
Yeah, yeah, I'm gassin', woah
You ain't 'bout that action, no, woah

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Guala, guala, guala guala
I'm livin' like it's no tomorrow
Don't loan my style, won't let you borrow
You thirsty, have a glass of water
I'm killin' these beats, there'll be more dead
I put my dick on her forehead
Less conversation and more head
Emergency, this is a code red
Guala, guala, guala guala
She said her name but I forgot it
I seen it, liked it, so I copped it
If you ain't talkin' money, change the topic
After party in the hills
She want Vodka and pills
She so numb she don't feel
Always stay active, we stay in the field
Man, goddamn, it's too real
Crazy, Amityville

[Pre-Chorus: Thirty Rack]
Yeah, yeah, I'm gassin', woah (Gassin', woah)
You ain't 'bout that action, no, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm 'laxin', woah ('Laxin', woah)
Your bitch is cashin'

[Chorus: Thirty Rack & G-Eazy]
And she want the guala guala (Pew, pew, pew)
And she like the guala guala

Guala guala, yeah, guala guala, yeah (Pew, pew, pew)

[Verse 2: Thirty Rack]
Guala guala on my dick (Dick)

Guala guala on my wrist (Woo)
Diamonds lookin' like piss (Pssssh)
Forty hoes on my dick (Huh)
Fifty hoes on my dick (Woah)
Sixty hoes on my dick (Woah)
God damn, a nigga rich (Bling)
Bitch Cuban, she don't talk a lot (Nah)
All she knows is to fuck a lot (Huh)
She break it down for a nigga (Pop, pop, pop, pop)
She shoot a nigga if you talk a lot (Do, do, do, do)
'Cause I'm bad to the bone (To the bone)
All diamonds, straight froze (Froze)
If you fuck with my nigga (Nigga)
I'ma have to let it go

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Me and Carnage, we don't lose
I don't chase, I go choose
I drink water, I drink booze
Fresh clothes, new shoes
Aw this shit is A-O-B
Get money out a bitch is my J-O-B
I just smoke, drink, stay low-key
Goddamn these bitches stay on G
I'm baffled the fuck boy that hate on me
I give the game that they don't see
If they know me, they don't pay no fee
I'm the weather channel man at KOD
It's lit like a matchbook
If she look, well then thatâ€™s took
And if I take her out in front of  you
She comin', she don't come with you
Mmm, that's a bad look

[Pre-Chorus: Thirty Rack]
Yeah, yeah, I'm gassin', woah (Gassin', woah)
You ain't 'bout that action, no, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm 'laxin', woah ('Laxin', woah)
Your bitch is cashin'

[Interlude: Grant Cardone]
Ayy look, I don't care what anybody tells you about money
I hear all these guys saying, man, money don't matter
If you follow the money, if you just work for money
Oh my god, you're going to fail
Let me tell you something
Go get that money
Go chase that money
Hahaha

[Chorus: Thirty Rack, G-Eazy & Grant Cardone]
And she want the guala guala (Pew, pew, pew, pew)
And she like the guala guala
And she want the guala guala
And she like the guala guala (Pew, pew, pew, pew)
Guala guala, guala guala
Guala guala, yeah guala guala, yeah (Go get that money)
Guala guala, yeah, guala guala, yeah (Go chase that)
Guala guala, yeah, guala guala, yeah
