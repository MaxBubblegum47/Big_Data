[Intro: Solange (Sampled)]
What
You and me will always be tight
Family every single day and night
Even when you starts acting like a fool
You know I'm loving every single thing you do

[Weird Moaning: Tory Lanez]

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Fuckin' you made me proud of me
'Cause I know that you doubted me
Even told me I would never get wit' ya
Told me I could never get wit' ya
But this pride in me
Wouldn't let you slide by me
That's when I came back 'round
I played my game with no respect, I finessed ya to make me seem down but
I finessed ya, it was all a stresser
I was your nigga, messed up, fucked your head up
Shoulda never came 'round
You let me in and I let you down
I was wrong 'cause I fucked up the game, baby
Your name crazy in the streets, got 'em sayin' things
My pride was the cause of it all
I apologize for the flaws in it all, wrongs in it all, 'cause

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
I know my pride, ain't always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Baby, I shoulda listened when you told me
I would do better as a homie, yeah
Right there, I shoulda took a note
But pride was buggin' on me
I shouldn't, I shouldn't make excuses now
'Cause I know that it's useless now
You know what the truth is now
You swear you know how I do shit now
So I'll be gone 'til November
Talkin' old Timberlands in the winter
With this .5 on my side and my .40
You moved on but you still are my shawty
I don't wanna lie because I'm right wit' ya
You always pick me up, I don't get ya
I been tryna find your heart, I'm still tryin'
You can find someone else but you're still mine, 'cause

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
Know my pride, ain't always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you
