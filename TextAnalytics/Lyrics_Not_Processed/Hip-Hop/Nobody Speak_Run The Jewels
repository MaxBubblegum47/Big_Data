[Verse 1: El-P, Killer Mike & Both]
Picture this, I'm a bag of dicks, put me to your lips
I am sick, I will punch a baby bear in his shit
Give me lip, I'ma send you to the yard, get a stick
Make a switch, I can end the conversation real quick
I am crack, I ain't lyin', kick a lion in his crack
I'm the shit, I will fall off in your crib, take a shit
Pinch your momma on the booty, kick your dog, fuck your bitch
Fat boy dressed up like he's Santa and took pictures with your kids
We the best, we will cut a frowny face in your chest
Little wench, I'm unmentionably fresh, I'm a mensch
Get correct, I will walk into a court while erect
Screaming, "Yes, I am guilty, motherfuckers, I am death"
Ayy, you wanna hear a good joke?
Nobody speak, nobody get choked

[Verse 2: El-P & Killer Mike]
Ayy, get running, start pumping your bunions, I'm coming
I'm the dumbest, who flamethrow your function to Funyuns
Flame your crew quicker than Trump fucks his youngins
Now face the flame, fuckers, your fame and fate's done with
I rob Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Linus and Lucy
Put coke in the doobie, roll woolies to smoke with Snoopy
I still remain that dick-grabbin' slacker that spit a loogie
'Cause the toter of the toolie'll murder you friggin' moolies
Fuck outta here, yeah

[Chorus: El-P & Killer Mike]
Nobody speak, nobody gettin' choked, hey
Nobody speak, nobody gettin' choked, hey
Nobody speak
Nobody speak

[Verse 3: El-P & Killer Mike]
Only facts, I will shoot a baby duck if it quacks with a Ruger
Top billin', come cops some villainous shots
It's boxed, shipped out and bought and y'all feeling it
El-P killin' it, Killer Mike killin' shit
What more can I say? We top billin' it
Valiant without villainy, viciously foul victory
Burn towns and villages, burning, looting and pillaging
Murderers try to hurt us, we curse them and all their children
I just want the bread and bologna bundles to tuck away
I don't work for free, I am barely giving a fuck away
So tell beggin' Johnny and Mommy to get the fuck away
Ayo, here's a gun, son, now run, get it the gutterway
Live to shoot another day

[Chorus: El-P & Killer Mike]
Nobody speak, nobody gettin' choked, hey
Nobody speak, nobody gettin' choked, hey
Nobody speak
Nobody speak
Nobody speak, nobody gets choked
