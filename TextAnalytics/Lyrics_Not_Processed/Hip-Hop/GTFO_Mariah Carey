[Intro]
How 'bout you?
How 'bout you?

[Verse 1]
You took my love for granted
You left me lost and disenchanted
Bulldozed my heart as if you planned it
My prince was so unjustly handsome

[Pre-Chorus]
Who was that knight in shining armor?
I could've sworn you'd love me harder
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
I ain't the type to play the martyr

[Chorus]
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Get the fuck out
(How 'bout you)
Take your 
tings
 and be on your merry way
Fly off with the wind, bye bye baby
(How 'bout you)
Scusa mi, Mimi call you a valet
(You just) take your tings and be on your merry way

[Verse 2]
My friends all saw it in your eyes
They told me once, they told me twice
I looked beyond all the signs
I guess false love makes you blind, ay

[Pre-Chorus]
Who was that knight in shining armor?
(You, you, you)
I could've sworn you'd love me harder
(You, you, you)
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
(You, you, you)
I ain't the type to play the martyr

[Chorus]
How 'bout you get the fuck out? (How about)
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How about you get the fuck out?
(How 'bout you)
Take your tings and be on your merry way
(How 'bout you)
Fly off with the wind, bye bye, baby
(How 'bout you)
Scusa mi, Mimi call you a valet
(How 'bout you)
Take your tings and be on your merry way
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
(Fuck out, fuck out)

[Hook]
(Get the fuck out)
Stop telling me these lies when you're bluffing
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Go stay at your friend's house or something
Don't mean to be rude, but take your shit and leave
(How 'bout you)
Go stay at your friend's house or something
(How 'bout you)
Go stay with your homeboys you was talking to
(How 'bout you)
I ain't tryna be rude, but you're lucky
(How 'bout you)
I ain't kick your ass out last weekend

[Outro]
(How 'bout you)
Take your tings and be on your merry way
(How 'bout you)
Fly off with the wind, bye bye, baby
