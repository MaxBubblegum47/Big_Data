Ricco Barrino] (Krayzie)

Hey, wooo, ooooh, hey yeah, oooh now
If I had one wish
That wish would be clear
That I would not have to go
That I could stay here
And although it hurts me
To leave you all alone
Just know I’ll come back to you
For now I am gone
Gone, for now I am gone [x's 2]
(For now I am gone, for now I am gone
For now I am gone, for now I am..gone [x's 2])

[Krayzie Bone]
When I’m dead and gone don’t even worry
Don’t mourn me too long death-a get ya discouraged
Keepin’ your vision blurry, prison and mentally hurtin’
I know it for certain if I’m really restin’ in heaven
No need for you to fear don’t cry
‘Cause death won’t forever have a grip on our life
So I’m-a be coming big?(bet) ready for the last shine
‘Cause I am a believer that I’ll see a resurrection
Don’t believe that I’ll burn in hell
I study the scriptures and they learn me well
No trippin’, no drippin’, no purgatory I dwell
I sleep, I rest in peace ’til I prevail
It’s just a temporary lay down I won’t forever stay down
So keep me in your memory don’t let me fade out
I’ll probably never see you at the crossroads
Guess I was wrong I’m gone, gone, long gone

[Chorus]
If I had one wish
That wish would be clear
That I would not have to go
That I could stay here
And although it hurts me
To leave you all alone
Just know I’ll come back to you
For now I am gone

[Layzie Bone]
We hit the road back in 1993
Had a vision like a prophet
The project was go see
The logic was so deep
I come back and do a lotta good
I heard ya callin’ so I headed out to Hollywood
One way tickets, my niggas and no fear
Some said that we was trippin’ the mission was so clear
Don’t wanna go there, the money was over there
I still love ya ‘99, I miss ya St. Claire
Yeah, now I’m movin’ on a rollercoaster
Just ridin’ tryin’ to be Jehovah’s soldier
And I’m grindin’ tryin’ to make it better for ya
So for now I best be gone, be gone
I made a vow to change the world somehow
I’ma impact it and see it in this lifetime
On the dark road to bring back the sunshine
But for now I’m gone, I gotta go get it

[Chorus]
[Wish Bone]
If it’s out there to get
Then I’ma go and get it
Get it ’til I got nothin’ left, chasin’ better livin’
It’s a ‘tinuos mission, so I’m steady movin’
And I gotta get it in, never settle for losin’
I’m a thug true, add to or get out the way
You could settle for less but I need more on my plate
Eatin’ good, family good
Okay, ’til that day, I’m-a get up and move, move
Show my babies how the thug do, ooh
I’m-a play it like it’s my last game
If it’s due better give it up right away
‘Cause a thug niggas gonna bring pressure
See me f-cked up, starvin’ nigga never
And as long as niggas out here gettin’ paid
Back to my old ways
Who they gonna run and tell, huh?
It’s a street thang, come on

[Chorus]
[Flesh]
Yeah we ready, back up in ‘em
Wit nothin’ but that harmony rhythm
Hard hittin’ flows all we give ‘em
Flows that spit venom
No cop there goes the end of ‘em
Ever since the beginning we winnin’ it
Get a glimpse of legends standin’ on deck
‘Til we come, we be here holdin’ down the set
Keep on wonderin’ what the Bone ’bout to do next
Still they humble and the hungriest, God bless
The fan fam flex, all across the U.S
Overseas and Tel Aviv and back west
You know we go the hardest
No need to say we better than the rest
It’s obvious more less
Came down off my high from the wet
When I had to do a stretch
I signed so I cashed the check
Had me caught up in a game, insane
My head blown, what’s goin’ on
‘Cause ain’t nobody home

[Chorus]
[End]
