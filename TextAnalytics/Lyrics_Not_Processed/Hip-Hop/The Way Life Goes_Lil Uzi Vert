[Refrain: Lil Uzi Vert]
That's true (That's true), that's right (That right, that right)
She's sipping Moët, and yeah, I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder (Yeah, it's red)
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar ('Bout my bread)
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together (Yeah)
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header (Woah)
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

[Bridge: Lil Uzi Vert]
Hello
I was listening to this song
It go like

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (Yeah)
You'll find another life to live (Yeah)
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give (Yeah)
You'll find another life to live (Yeah)
I know that you'll get over it (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things (Yeah)
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the rain (Damn, yeah)
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame
(Broke boy, broke boy, broke boy, broke boy)
Damn, that just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (Real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (Yeah)
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
And I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give (Yeah)
You'll find another life to live (Ayy)
I know that you'll get over it

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
I tied up my RAF, you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me, I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'ma let her (Bye)
Go over there with that broke fella (Go over)
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather, ooh (Yeah)
My new chick I swear that she better, ooh
Want me back, never (Ooh)

[Refrain: Lil Uzi Vert]
That's true (That's true), that's right (That right, that right)
She's sipping Moët, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter (Woah)
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder (Yeah, it's red)
No, I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar ('Bout my bread)
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together (Yeah)
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header (Woah)
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

[Chorus: Oh Wonder & 
Lil Uzi Vert
]
I know it hurts sometimes (
Woah
), but you'll get over it (
But why?
)
You'll find another life to live (
You'll find
)
I swear that you'll get over it (
You'll get over it
)
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (
No, no
)
You'll find another life to live (
You will
)
I know that you'll get over it (
Oh
)

[Outro: Lil Uzi Vert]
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moët, and yeah, I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
