[Verse 1]
Looks like this place is closing it down
We're the only two other people still hanging around
Bartender don't get too far away
No, we don't need another drink
Girl I'm afraid of what I might say

[Chorus]
I can't trust myself alone with you
I keep thinking about you thinking it too
I couldn't stop myself from doing what I want to do to you
I can't trust myself
No, I can't trust myself alone with you

[Verse 2]
Is it too late now to call up a couple good friends
Hop on a subway train, pray that somebody else is getting it
We're not drunk enough to think this is right
You should go home to yours and I should go home to mine

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't trust myself alone with you
I keep thinking about you thinking it too
I couldn't stop myself from doing what I want to do to you
I can't trust myself
No, I can't trust myself

[Bridge]
I know I can't stay but I don't want to leave
No, we couldn't make it through one more drink

[Chorus]
Oh no, I can't trust myself alone with you
I keep thinking about you thinking it too
I couldn't stop myself from doing what I want to do to you
I can't trust myself
No, I can't trust myself
I can't trust myself alone with you
