[MORITZ]
God, I dreamed there was an angel
Who could hear me through the wall
As I cried out, like in Latin
"This is so not life at all!
Help me out, out of this nightmare,"
Then I heard her silver call
She said: "Just give it time, kid
I come to one and all"

She said, "Give me that hand, please
And the itch you can't control
Let me teach you how to handle
All the sadness in your soul
Oh, we'll work that silver magic
Then we'll aim it at the wall"
She said, "Love may make you blind, kid
But I wouldn't mind at all"

[BOYS (OTTO)]
It's the bitch of living
(Bitch, just the bitch)
Nothing but your hand
(Just the bitch, yeah)
Just the bitch of living
As someone, you can't stand

[GEORG]
See, each night, it's like, fantastic
Tossing, turning, without rest
'Cause my day's at the piano
With my teacher and her breasts
And the music's, like, the one thing
I can even get at all
And those breasts! I mean God, please
Just let those apples fall

[BOYS]
It's the bitch of living (Bitch, ah ah ah)
With nothing going on, nothing going on
Just the bitch of living
Asking, "what went wrong?"
Do they think we want this?
Oh, who knows?

[ERNST]
See, there's showering at gym class

[HANSCHEN]
Bobby Maler, he's the best
Looks so nasty in those khakis

[ERNST]
God, my whole life's, like, some test

[OTTO]
Then there's Marianna Wheelan
As if she'd return my call

[HANSCHEN]
It's like, just kiss some ass, man
Then you can screw 'em all

[BOYS]
All...

[MELCHIOR & BOYS]
It's the bitch of living
It's the bitch of living
And living in your head
In your head
It's the bitch of living
And sensing God is dead

[MORITZ & BOYS, MELCHIOR]
It's the bitch of living
You watch me, just watch me
And trying to get ahead
I'm calling, and one day
It's the bitch of living
Just gettin' out of bed
All will know
It's the bitch of living, living
All will know
Living and getting what you get
Just the bitch of living

[BOYS]
And, Knowing this is it
God, is this it?
This can't be it
Oh God, what a bitch!
