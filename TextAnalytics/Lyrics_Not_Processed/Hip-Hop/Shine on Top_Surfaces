[Chorus: Forrest & Alexa]
Even if the sun goes down on you
You gotta keep that shine on top yeah
On top, yeah
On top, yeah
And even if the sun goes down on you
You gotta keep that shine on top yeah
On top, yeah
On top, yeah

[Verse 1: Forrest]
I'm cruising, through the city
Had to get outside, it couldn’t get anymore pretty
I’m moving, who’s coming with me?
Swerving on my bike, making twenty feel like fifty
Man they miss me, aye, got the pedal moving swiftly
Vibe like sons and I had raise em strictly
Wishing, I could always stay this way, aye
Chilling by the bay, had to make me say that

[Chorus: Forrest & Alexa]
Even if the sun goes down on you
You gotta keep that shine on top yeah
On top, yeah
On top, yeah
And even if the sun goes down on you
You gotta keep that shine on top yeah
On top, yeah
On top, yeah

[Verse 1: Forrest]
Now brake, take it in
Feel it all around, take a breathe, feel the wind
Don’t fake (Nah), that’s a sin
Invest in yourself, liberate, dividend
Cash it in, never spend, 'less you chilling with a friend
And he don't have means to get his pocket filled with ends
Still, a man is wishing, I could always stay this way
Chilling by the bay, had to make them say that

[Chorus: Forrest & Alexa]
Even if the sun goes down on you
You gotta keep that shine on top yeah
On top, yeah
On top, yeah
And even if the sun goes down on you
You gotta keep that shine on top yeah
On top, yeah
On top, yeah
