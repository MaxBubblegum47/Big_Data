[Verse 1]
Can someone tell me why I'm still in the same place I've been?
I don't get as much out as I think I put in
There's no promise I've heard that a life can't outlive
That's not for me to say, but please tell me what is

[Chorus]
I don't care to mean anything to someone
I just want to mean something in general
There are memories that I have of days done
One thing Iâ€™ve noticed is that they always seem better than today

[Verse 2]
I'm sure there's a psychological explanation
But there's no vacation
For a mind with low tendency for creation
And I tend to avoid any situation
That requires any level of sophistication
I know my heart is not physically breaking
I'll wake up tomorrow intrinsically fading

[Bridge]
I haven't been incredibly social as of late
And I think that that's okay
But my left brain it's gonna kill me
And I know my songs will still be
Here at the end of the day
Those who still believe in fate
Should listen to me intently

[Chorus]
I don't care to mean anything to someone
I just want to mean something in general
There have been memories of days that have since come undone
One thing I've noticed is they were more fun than today
I don't wanna see today
I don't really wanna play
There's no reason to stay
There's no reason to stay
