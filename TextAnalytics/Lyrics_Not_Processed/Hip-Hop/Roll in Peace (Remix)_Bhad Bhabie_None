[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
First, they gone mention my age
Then they gone mention my race
Hit four million views in a day
They should admire the pace
Came from the bottom for real
Boynton beach used to be home
Now I'm in the Hollywood Hills
And more than ever in the zone

[Verse: Bhad Bhabie]
But now I can't roll in peace
TMZ following me
Everybody want the scoop
Wish you'd bitches let me breathe
Only five foot but I'm all savage
Knock a bitch out on the airline
Yelling fuck Spirit, hope them hoes hear it
And I'll let you have it like it ain't mine
I don't pick up at the landline
When they bring me up you better at mine
I'm pulling up in a Panamera with a pink slip so you know its mine
My daddy ain't buy it he left me in private
And tried to come back when he seen I was shining
But fuck him I'm grinding *These Heaux* on the charts and it's climbing just wait till a bitch going diamond
Red hair, don't care
Catching stares everywhere like what the problem is
How you hatin' with your grown ass when I'm fourteen, and got my mama rich
I'll go out right now and they taking pics
I remember when they didn't give a shit
Wasn't looking twice when I was Danielle
Now its Bhad Bhabie all up in this bitch
Your artist scared of my brand
Suck my dick that's all that I'm saying
All these artists hating online
Like it's me that's stopping they shine
Get you some money
My bodyguard raking two-hundred a year
You broke and you bummy
I don't wanna hear it got over a million endorsements
Why you thirsty for importance
I call it quits on the Xan's
It had me too slow on my hands
Now I ain't losing again
Test me I'm proving to win
They wanna see me in jail
Good luck with seeing me fail
I know the courts is corrupted
But I won't be in no cell
They tryna' make an example
I say I'll set it myself
Said I was too disrespectful
Putting my mama through hell
F.Y.I. we doing well
And I got the mortgage secure
And they gonna hate me for sure
And all of these hunnid's my cure
Young, rich and I'm outta control
Making bands like I'm out on the road
Dodging twelve, yelling fuck the trial
Balling out like it's all that I know
I let em hate cause I know that they broke
My wave coming betta' go with the flow
See 'em sinking while I stay afloat
Pay attention I can show you the ropes

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
First, they gone mention my age
Then they gone mention my race
Hit four million views in a day
They should admire the pace
You should be minding your place
Why is you all in my face
Yeah I'm young and I'm rich, and I'm small but I'm brave
