[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yung Tago on the beat
It's Yung Tago on the beat
Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy, that's probably Tago

[Chorus]
I fell straight on my face, I'll take the blame for that
Heart been broke so many times, and I can't take it back
I've been so scared of love, got commitment issues
But somehow, some way I fell in love with you
But how would you feel if I told you that I think you the one?
How would you feel if I told you that I can't get enough?
How would you feel if I told you that, girl, I need your love?
How would you feel? How would you feel?

[Verse 1]
How would you feel if I told you that, girl, I need your love?
How would you feel if I told you that, girl, I need your touch?
Could you feel me if I told you that it's hard to trust
I been hurt before, I done heard these words before
I done took lies straight to the face, been stabbed in my back
I done been crossed by my closest people, can't blame you for that
Last bitch told me that she love me, couldn't stand on that
Told me that she would never leave me, then her bags was packed
So I guess you can take that story, say I'm traumatized
They say I look just like my dad with my mama's eyes
They say our future's like my father with my mama's pride
'Cause if I ever kiss that Cupid, it's a homicide
I was tryna lock up my heart and throw away the key
But somehow, you made the key take control of me
I told myself never again would I ever fall
But when I see those pretty eyes, I wanna risk it all

[Chorus]
I fell straight on my face, I'll take the blame for that
Heart been broke so many times, and I can't take it back
I've been so scared of love, got commitment issues
But somehow, some way I fell in love with you
But how would you feel if I told you that I think you the one?
How would you feel if I told you that I can't get enough?
How would you feel if I told you that, girl, I need your love?
How would you feel? How would you feel?

[Outro]
Your, in your, in your, ooh
Your, in your, in your, ooh
Your, in your, in your, in your, ooh
In your, ooh, in your, in your, in your, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your, in your, in your, in your, ooh
In your, in your, in your, ooh
As I'm sayin'
How would you feel? How would you feel?
Grrah, grrah
