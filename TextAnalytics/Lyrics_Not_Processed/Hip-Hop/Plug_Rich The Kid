[Chorus: Rich The Kid]

I was juggin', finessin', and flexin' (Flex), 'til I ran into the plug (Plug)
I got the ki wrapped up in the Louis V now they callin' me the plug (What?)

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Thirty inches on that G body, nigga, I don't ride dub, really, I'm the plug (Ayy)
Kodak, why you do me like that? I just want a lil' love, no bitch, I'm a thug
Nigga already know what's up, so don't try to dap me up, when you see me in the club
She say "Baby, you ain't gotta rush," but I already caught my nut
What you expect? I'm booted up
I told her leave her shoes at the door
I better not catch you steppin' on my rug or I'ma wet you up
(Plug)
