Yeah
Ooh, what a night it was
The night I fell apart
I begged a lover not to go away
But she went and broke my heart
I found myself in a Vegas bar
With a whole new set of friends
Seen through the bottom of an empty glass
Like looking through a fisheye lens
Oh, one night in Vegas
It was a morning of revenge
For what I did the night before
Which accompanied me to the following day
To even up the score
In a stone cold sober mood
The next afternoon at ten
I found my tongue back in my mouth
I told myself not to drink again
Ah, one night in Vegas, ha ha
Yeah, I was three sheets to the wind
The three shots did me in
Three angels there above me
As I was lying on the floor
I knew I should have run for the hills
But I still wanted more
I don't remember the chapel
But I woke up with a wife
I looked at her, she looked at me
And now we're hooked for life
How strange the situation
It's now been thirty years
Since I met that girl in Vegas
Would you believe it?
And she's still here
Oh, one night in Vegas, oh yeah
I gotta tell you, oh, one night in Vegas
Hey, one night in Vegas
Oh yeah
