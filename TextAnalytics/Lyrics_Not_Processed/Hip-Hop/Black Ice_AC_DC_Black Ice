[Verse 1]
Well the devil may care
You toss them back and be a man

[Chorus]
Every last time
Black ice
End of it all, end of the line
End of the road
Ooh, black ice
Black ice

[Verse 2]
Come on, bleeding out the walls
We're marching on, the women call
Many a mile I'd never take
I run for forty miles and I come up running late
Donâ€™t you know I live it down?
When the devil come a-calling, I ain't going to be around

[Chorus]
Black ice
Black ice
Black ice
When the devil come a-calling, I ain't going to be around
Black ice

[Verse 3]
Women all living large
Shoot for the moon, you're gonna take it all
And I am going to rip it out
I'll kick, I'll creep-crawl down your street
I'll gouge your eyes out

[Chorus]
Black ice
Black ice
Black ice
Black ice

[Chorus]
My life
Black ice
My life
Black ice
My life
When the devil come a-calling, I ain't going to be around
I'll kick, I creep-crawl down your street and gouge your eyes out
Black ice
