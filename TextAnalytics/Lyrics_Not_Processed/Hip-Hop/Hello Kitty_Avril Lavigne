[Intro]
Minna saikō, arigatō, ka-ka-ka-kawaii
Ka-ka-ka-kawaii

[Verse 1]
Mom's not home tonight
So we can roll around, have a pillow fight
Like a major rager, OMFG (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let's all slumber party
Like a fat kid on a pack of Smarties
Someone chuck a cupcake at me (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
It's time for spin the bottle
Not gonna talk about it tomorrow
Keep it just between you and me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let's play truth or dare now
We can roll around in our underwear
How every silly kitty should be (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so pretty, pretty
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Stay with me
Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so silly, silly
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Play with me

[Chorus]
Ka-ka-ka-kawaii
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so pretty
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so silly

[Verse 2]
Wake up, got a secret
Pinky swear that you're gonna keep it
I've got something you need to see (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let's be friends forever
I wanna do everything with you together
Come and play with kitty and me (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so pretty, pretty
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Stay with me
Come, come, kitty, kitty
You're so silly, silly
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Play with me

[Chorus]
Ka-ka-ka-kawaii
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so pretty
Hello kitty, hello kitty
Hello kitty, you're so silly

Hello kitty, you're so silly

[Pre-Chorus]
Come, come, kitty, kitty (Hello kitty, hello kitty)
You're so pretty, pretty
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Stay with me
Come, come, kitty, kitty
 (Hello kitty, hello kitty)
You're so silly, silly
Don't go, kitty, kitty
Play with me
