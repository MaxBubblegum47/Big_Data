[Verse 1]
Listen
Pick me up, fill my cup
Pour me another round
Come on in, mix in the sin
Come in and join the crowd
I said
It's party time when I'm on the loose
Make it feel alright
(Listen) Drinks all around I'm in the mood
Because the night is mine

[Chorus]
Let's play ball
Shootin' down the walls
Let's play ball, baby
Battin' down the stalls
Play, play, play ball

[Verse 2]
Listen Sid
Light me up, I'm in love
I'm off the leash and unbound
Dive on in and swim in the gin
Come on, shout it out loud

[Chorus]
Let's play ball
Shooting down the wall, yeah
Let's play ball
Battin' down the stalls, yeah
Play, play, play ball

[Solo]
Hit that thing right here
Hey, yeah
It's a home run

[Outro]
Let's play ball
Shooting at a wall
Let's play ball
Battin' down the stall
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Play, play, play ball
