[Phone Conversation]
Big Sean: You ever made love in the studio?
Female: Ha-ha, I never did it before
Sean: You want to?
Female:  think I’d be interesting
Sean: Ooo
Female: To the music and then you could like, press play, like, I mean record and record it in the booth
Sean: We could make it, we could make it happen
Female: And then you could like, throw it in a song or something, background, chop it up, whatever ya’ll be doin’, I don’t know how that work
Sean: I mean shit, we could go crazy…I could, you’d let me bend you over the keyboard?
Female: Hey, I like it that way
Sean: Hey, I ain’t never been mad — never have been, never will be

[Verse 1]
Uh-huh
I took you to that expensive restaurant, you so picky please
I still ain’t hit this week so next week is Mickey-D’s
Girl no hickies please
I know that she feeling me, so Ima take her back to the crib to come feel on me
Your name is Tiffany?
Her name is Hillary
Together I almost slipped up and called you Tiffillary
Girl is you kidding me?
Can’t meet your mom though, I just wanna take you right back to my condo
And I’m hoping I’m turning you on like a console
‘Cause with that weave in your head you lookin’ like Tonto
So Ima want the breast and thigh with that, like the combo
She know I’m in charge, she callin’ me the head honcho
And baby I’m afraid if I can’t get that skirt off, then Ima probably hop up in the whip and skrrt off
‘Cause playing hard to get nowadays is such a turn off
And you gon’ feel different as soon as you sip on this Smirnoff
You dig?

[Hook]
(It’s been a long week, yeah word)
(And I’m gonna take you outta that skirt)
(So why don’t you come and sip on something)
(I could bring my friend, you could bring your friend)
Listen, I got short ones, fat ones, Indian and black ones
Small ones, tall ones, [?] and them rap ones
He one hit and quit ‘em so he never call ‘em back, hoes
One hit and quit ‘em so he never call ‘em back, hoes

[Verse 2]
I realize that I don’t need hoes, they need me
Soon as they see me, “Oh, I heard your CD”
I know they wanna hop on my peepee
So presidential, I should move to DC
You could ask Kiki, Michelle, and Niecy
They all, take it to the summit like BGs
That’s bubble guts, damn
And I ran through a couple sluts, that’s a whole lotta bubble butts, word?
Periodically like the shuttle bus
And Ima probably order all them hoes some Moet
‘Cause that get ‘em more wet and that mean more sex
Girl, call up your friend, let me come hit the whole set
And Ima probably have them hung up like the coat check
Girl, get on your knees let me give you a throat check
And since they and their friends want some, oh them hoes next
And Ima probably work them all out like the Bowflex
And you and your friends could all watch like Rolex
