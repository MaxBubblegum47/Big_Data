[Verse 1: CVBZ]
Growin' up in the golden age
Throwin' rocks at your window pane
"Kiss me once and I'll float away"
But that ain't me anymore
Well I don't mind if I sell my soul
To get a song on the radio
"Credit cards and my student loans"
That's so millennial

[Chorus: Fetty Wap & CVBZ]
Do you remember how it feels to be young?
Do you remember?
We could be anyone
Now I miss the view from the floor of your room
September came way too soon
Do you remember how it feels to be young?

[Break: Fetty Wap]
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Remember cuttin' class, we would smoke and chill
It was only gym and lunch, we thought it was real
I was even failin' math, I ain't even care
Yeah just to be around you made it worth it
I dropped out, but you still said I'm perfect
I remember at the prom you was perfect
I remember you were walking on graduation day
I never got the chance to say

[Chorus: CVBZ & Fetty Wap]
That I remember all the time that we spent
And I remember you were really my friend
And I remember you were really my friend
And I remember when they all looked and laughed
Now it's crazy how they all on your ass
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, baby, it feels great, mothafucka, yeah
Yeah, baby, it feels great, mothafucka, yeah

[Break: Fetty Wap]
Yeah, it feels great, mothafucka, yeah
Yeah, it feels great, mothafucka, yeah, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Fetty Wap & CVBZ]
Do you remember how it feels to be young?
Do you remember we could be anyone?
Now I miss the view from the floor of your room
September came way too soon
Do you remember how it feels to be young?

[Break: Fetty Wap]
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah (yeah)
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah (yeah)
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It feels great, mothafucka, yeah
