[Verse 1: DDG]
You cannot tell her shit, she just tryna get rich (Yeah)
In the club too thick (Bitch), everybody wanna hit (Yeah)
She would not let 'em hit though, these niggas broke and she know
She phone me on the low (Low), DDG finna blow, yeah
Throw that ass so quick (Hit), she my number one pick (Yeah)
Baby girl too lit (Yeah), but these niggas ain't shit
Shawty cute just face it, eyeballin' no Lasik
Open up let me taste it, I ain't tryna be basic
She ain't really with the games, no play for the lames
Smart girl got brains, and she ballin', no James
Shawty bad (Yeah), she got a whole lotta ass (Yeah)
In her bag (Yeah), shawty finessin' the cash (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: YBN Nahmir]
I say "girl, what you finna do?" (Ayy), for that cash
Girl you better drop it low, too quick, move it fast
I might push up in that Porsche and you know I do the dash
Had to go flood out my wrist, and you know it cost a bag (Ayy, ayy)
Say they like the way my neck shine, bitch I'm too lit
Know they wanna be a part of this 'cause nigga, we the shit
Is you stupid? You ain't hoppin' in my car without a stick
Chopper bullets hit they body if we catch 'em on that fifth (Ayy)
Bankrolls after bankrolls after bankrolls (Ayy)
It got 'em changin' just like how these niggas change clothes
And you can catch me up in places where they can't go
Turn that 'K on, I'm still up in the trenches with my chains on

[Chorus: DDG]
Lil' baby gon' (Uh) run it up(Uh), run it up (Uh)

[Verse 3: Blac Youngsta]
She gon' run to the bag and stack it up fast, young perp', I spend it on drip (Run it up)
She don't wanna gimme no head, so I called her up a cab, hoe this your Lyft (Run it up)
I'ma have to take these niggas to court, they done auto theft my drift (Run it up)
E'time I go to the shake joint, e'body know I'ma leave a lil' tip
She smart and thick, she classified, on baker's script, her ass is out
She showed a nigga love in a Benz, she sucked the pigs to pass it out
This my bitch, when she whine and trip I give her a pacifier
And I grip, when she ride my stick, I fuck her lashes out
Two of my homeboys tryna go to war, gotta make 'em hash it out
First thing I was taught when I was growin' up, don't keep a stash in the house
Turn a hood bitch 'to a princess, teach a hood bitch how to invest
I come from the bottom where I'm from, boy I'm a legend like I'm Denzel

[Chorus: DDG & G Herbo]

She gon' shake it fast (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa), she gon' drop it low

Run it up (Run it up), fuck it up (Ugh)
C'mon, let a rich nigga fuck or some' (Ugh)
Gon' take the dick, what you runnin' from?
Bitch I'm lit, come and see your first hunnid bucks
Aw yeah, you think you come look at some'?
Bitch you must think I'm a duck or some' (Ugh)
Gon' let through, I fuck or some' (Ugh)
Let my DJ get sucked or some'
Wanna hang around with the gang-gang (Ugh)
Lemme get a three-way if you one of us
You already know CJ if you one of us
Swervo on replay if you one of us (Swerve)
I already know you come to fuck (Boy)
I ain't e'en tryna talk, get up on the bus
I ain't e'en tryna talk on one of us (Ugh)
