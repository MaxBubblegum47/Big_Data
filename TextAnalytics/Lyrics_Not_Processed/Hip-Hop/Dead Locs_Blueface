[Intro]
Blueface, baby
On the dead locs
Yeah, aight

On the dead locs
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Finna over-bleed this, lil' baby
On the dead locs, on the dead locs

[Verse]
I ain't turnin' down nothing
I turn nothing into something, lil' baby
On the dead locs
Fuck a nigga talkin' 'bout?
Seen him in person, now niggas wanna talk it out
That's on the dead locs
Fuck them cases
I don't wanna see no judge, only blue faces
On the dead locs
Yeah, aight
How you on the set all day and still can't fight?
On the dead locs
Yeah, Infant Mob
Broke lil' baby, get off your ass, get a job
On the dead locs
Tatted to my face, fuck a job
If I go broke, man, somebody gettin' robbed
On the dead locs
I don't mean to be mean
Don't chase me, bitch, chase your dreams
On the dead locs
You scared of bein' lonely, lil' baby?
Bitch, I'm scared of bein' broke
On the dead locs
Blueface vs. your nigga, lil' baby, thats like Benz vs. Ford
Bitch, I been had shit these niggas still can't afford, yeah aight
That's on the dead locs
Chase a bag, don't worry 'bout what I'm doin'
I hate when I get up and the bitch ask, "Where you goin'?"
On the dead locs
Bitch, what is you sayin'?
All that playin' hard to get, lil' baby, stop playin'
On the dead locs
Blueface killin' verses
Lil' baby, I'm the flyest, show me who I'm versus
On the dead locs
Blueface been a joint
Bet the ten or four and watch me hit my point
On the dead locs
Stylin' without a stylist
Deuce in a liter, got a nigga really vibin'
On the dead locs
Gucci on my bag
Grammys on my neck, designer on my ass
On the dead locs
Yeah aight, how you niggas Town?
Nigga socked you out and you stopped comin' around
On the dead locs
Bitch, keep shit player
Long as I don't find out, lil' baby, I don't care
On the dead locs
Why everybody wanna be a pimp now?
The bitch is gon' snitch in the end
On the dead locs
If I go broke then it's kick door
Fuck a ho, lil' baby, I need the dough
On the dead locs

[Outro]
Stop playin', Blueface the flyest
You niggas couldn't see me on my worst day
I could sit here and talk off beat
My shit still slap like a pimp on his worst day
Yeah aight, on the dead locs
