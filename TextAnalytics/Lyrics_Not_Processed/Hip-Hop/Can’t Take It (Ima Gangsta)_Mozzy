[Verse 1: Mozzy]
All these niggas fallin' off, they ain't fallin' back
I'm countin' money momentarily, I'ma call you back
He told the pigs you was present, that’s what we call a rat
Quit speakin' down on my gangsta if you ain’t talkin' fact
Momma used to choke slam us just for talkin' back
Gangsta rap died with Pac, Mozzy brought it back
Nose bleed and I tooted the purest powder pack
Pullin' out the store with some woods and a pack of Sour Patch
Yeeky case, attorney finna devour that
They told me take the two, I said, "I'm bool," that’s how you counteract
Hunnid thou' cash, hunnid thou' in two accounts
I can't afford to go to jail, them niggas losin' out
20 somethin', momma asked me when I'm movin' out
I was broke back then but I'm Gucci now
This one up top all the time, down to shoot it out
Fuck the cameras and I don't care about who around

[Chorus: Mozzy & Bobby Luv]
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
Made a lot of mistakes, I'm a gangsta
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
Made a lot of mistakes, I'm a gangsta

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
I ain’t become what momma want me to be
But I told her learn to love me for me (learn to love me for me)
I hustle for her 'cause ain't nothin' for free
Remember back we had nothin' to eat (we had nothin' to eat)
Family Bargin Center, Granny was cheap
She'd never spend a hundred on sneaks (never spend a hundred on sneaks)
Three bands sellin' dope all week
That's how I really fell in love with the streets
I fell in love with the streets
Stolo, ride around on E, D.E. got that fire on me
Pull up to the market, I ain't ever  puttin' 5 on 3
Turn around and drop 5 on the tree, I been high all week
I know some niggas that done died in the streets
And there ain't too many that survive in these streets
It's suicide in these streets
His momma cried as he lie in these streets
They covered that boy body with sheets
I'ma pray for her, there ain't nothin' I can say to her
You can cancel the car wash, I'ma pay for it
Homie really my dawg, they gone pay for it
SK knock his lil' brother off the skateboard, Mop!
Fuck is a 10 shot? 30 pop the new stock
Photos bein' cropped, circle smaller than a dot
Pull up to the plug give him everything we got
Sacrifice it all for a dolla, talmboutit

[Chorus: Mozzy & Bobby Luv]
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
Made a lot of mistakes, I'm a gangsta
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
A lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
Made a lot of mistakes, I'm a gangsta
