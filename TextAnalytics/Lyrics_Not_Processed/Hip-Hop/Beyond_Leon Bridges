[Verse 1]
Don't wanna get ahead of myself
Feeling things I've never felt
It's kinda hard for me to explain
Her personality and everything
Brings me to my knees, ooh
She shines me up like gold on my arm
I wanna take it slow but it's so hard
I love to see her face in daylight
It's more than just our bodies at night
But she's really tempting me, ooh
Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?

[Chorus]
I'm scared to death that she might be it
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit
She might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)
Space and time in the afterlife
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?
She might just be my everything and beyond

[Verse 2]
I wanna bring her 'round to meet ya
I think you'd like her kind demeanor
I know that Grandma would've loved her, like she was her own
She makes me feel at home, ooh
Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?

[Chorus]
I'm scared to death that she might be it
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit
She might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)
Space and time in the afterlife
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?
She might just be my everything and beyond

[Bridge]
I give up, I'm in love crying out to you
O me o my I can't explain
She might just be my everything
O me o my I can't explain (Oohhh)
She might just be my everything
O me o my I can't explain
She might just be my everything (my everything)
So do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?

[Chorus]
I'm scared to death that she might be it
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit
She might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)
Space and time in the afterlife
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?
She might just be my everything and beyond

[Outro]
(She might just be mine)
O me o my I can't explain
(She might just be mine)
She might just be my everything
(She might just be mine)
O me o my I can't explain
(She might just be mine)
She might just be my everything
(She might just be mine)
O me o my I can't explain
(She might just be mine)
She might just be my everything
She might just be mine, be mine
