(Cardo got wings)
What?

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I said you already know, nigga, Young gotta flow
Before rap, Young really got dough (Yeah)
Before rap, Young really seen snow (Seen snow)
In the kitchen, 'bout to make some magic
Then blow it all in Magic (Haha)
Pull up on my partner in traffic
Gave it to him, it was all in plastic (Damn)
All I know, I ainâ€™t tryna go to jail (Go to jail)
Heard that shit closest thing to hell (Yeah)
When it's stepped on, make it hard to sell (What? What?)
When you been where I been, make it hard to fail (What? What? Ayy)
'Cause I'm the realest nigga in this, y'all know it (Yeah)
First nigga hittin' Magic in that 6-45 (Five)
Valet say, "Jizzle, nigga, stay in new shit
But everybody 'Bach back cause that nigga can't drive" (Haha)
Doors open up, I emerge with ten chains (Damn)
Even back then, they was calling me Ten Chains (Ayy)
Ask me what I spent, I tell 'em, "It's no thing"
If I had it added up, it'd cost me like ten things (Yeah)
We used to take a little show money just to throw money (Money)
If it's on the floor, nigga, it's the floor money
If you brought it out to blow when you got it from the blow
Then that's why the fuck they call that shit "blow money" (Woo)
Still the realest nigga in this, y'all know it
Kept it one hunnid since the day I came through
My nigga hit me up, say he goin' out of town
So I threw him fifty thou', told him, "Bring me back two" (That's right)
Not only had my fingers crossed, I prayed (Prayed)
Called this little piece up, got laid (Yeah)
Then he walked in, threw 'em both on the table
Said, "Fuck that shit, young nigga, get paid" (Paid)
Then I whipped the Benzo on Lorenzo (Zo)
Stay down, nigga, yeah, I'm talkin' ten toes (Toes)
Hoes see me in this big pretty motherfucker
Bet I leave the parkin' lot with about ten hoes

[Chorus: Jeezy, JAY-Z, Jeezy & JAY-Z ]
I done seen it all, yay stacked seven feet tall (Yeah)
Swear it look white like a wall (Haha)
What ya know about thumbin' through the hunnids, twenties and the fifties
Spendin' tens and the fives at the mall? (Yeah)
I done seen it all, 20/20 Pyrex vision (Ayy)
Catch a contact standin' next to my kitchen (Damn)
Hear the twenties, fifties, hunnids, the money machine clickin' (Yeah)
And my Rollie ain't tickin', I ball
I done seen it all

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uncle died on the spot
Pop killed the family with heroin shots (Real shit)
Gave my life to the block
Figured, I get shot, 'least I die on top (Real shit)
I came alive in the drop
Big body all white, shit looked like a yacht, ugh (Real shit)
I got 'em five grand a pop
Had a plug in Saint Thomas on a trillion watts, ugh (Trill shit)
Flew 'em back to the States
Parked ninety-two bricks in front of 560 State
Now the Nets a stone throw from where I used to throw bricks
So it's only right I'm still tossin' 'round Knicks, ugh
Probably brought your auntie a couple bags
I probably front your uncle a couple halves
Was in the S-Class, you was just in class
You know I was finna blow like a meth lab
Expanded the operation out in Maryland
Me and Emory Jones in the caravan
Took the show on the road out in VA
Dropped a couple off with Rolla in the PA (Real Rolla)
Plug got shot, we started slowin' up
Took a trip down to see how he was holdin' up
The war's on, now, he got shot again
This time he was gone for good, then we got it in
Emory got knocked, we was down ten
The whole team hot, walls closin' in
Niggas can't tell me shit about this dope game
'Bout this cocaine, man...

[Chorus: Jeezy, JAY-Z, Jeezy & JAY-Z ]
I done seen it all, yay stacked seven feet tall (Yeah)
Swear it look white like a wall (Haha)
What ya know about thumbin' through the hunnids, twenties and the fifties
Spendin' tens and the fives at the mall? (Yeah)
I done seen it all, 20/20 Pyrex vision (Ayy)
Catch a contact standin' next to my kitchen (Damn)
Hear the twenties, fifties, hunnids, the money machine clickin' (Yeah)
And my Rollie ain't tickin', I ball
I done seen it all
