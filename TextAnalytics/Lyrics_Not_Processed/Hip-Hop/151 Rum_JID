[Intro]
Act one, scene four

[Chorus]
Yeah, run, Ricky, run, run nigga, run, jump, nigga, jump
Come here they come, run, run, run, run
Gun with the drum, bum bitty bum, slump in the trunk
My city go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
151 rum and a blunt
Young nigga numb, numb, numb and he got a little gun
A little bitty killer really doin' it for fun
Give him a little bit and he'll get a nigga done

[Verse]
Son of a god, son of a bitch
Son of woman and man, son of a son, in a sunken abyss
Summon a plan, please come with a script
Cover my back, cover man, please come with the blitz
Look at the stats, JID like a magician
Fuck that, this some real ass shit, I paid blood for this
Taking cheese from the government
Cereal boxes with the bugs in it
Hand me down, this my brother brother's shit
Don't compare me to no other other niggas
In the city, boy, they say they fucking with you
Heebie jeebie, that's a bit disgusting, but I get it
I'm full of tension, full of spirit but full of shit
Standing next to Lil Tay when that bullet hit him
Shit, I miss him, I wish that that bullet missed him but it didn't
And since I been living with it like a sickness
Intimate, infinite rhymes, give me the baton
A ticking, ticking time bomb, takin' the finish line
Look alive, look in my eyes, look at you niggas tryin'
And ya dumb, dumb, better run, run 'cause we fryin' em
Eastside, where ya from, from niggas wildin'
So be silent before my niggas creep silent
With street knowledge, complete nonsense
Delete comments, online, all lies, we see violence
Every day in my eyes, they killing my niggas, die, nigga die
Pull up with the fye, get 'em, nigga, it's eye for an eye
If we gotta ride, fuck it, nigga, ride for the ride of ya life
Diabolical minds, I don't mind it, I like it, I like it, I love it
I fuck with you, you a thug, I'ma thug with you
We can knuck, we can buck if a nigga fuck with you
I got love for you out the mud with you, off the muscle

[Chorus]
Yeah, run Ricky, run, run nigga, run, jump nigga, jump
Come here they come run, run, run, run
Gun with the drum, bum bitty bum, slump in the trunk
My city go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
151 rum and a blunt
Young nigga numb, numb, numb and he got a little gun
A little bitty killer really doin' it for fun
Give him a little bit and he'll get a niggaâ€”
