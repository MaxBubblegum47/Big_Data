[Intro: Gucci Mane & Quavo]
Ha
It's Gucci, it's Drop Top
Wizop, whoo
Yeah, ayy (Go)

[Chorus: Quavo]
You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it (Yeah)
Straight out the lot, three hundred cash (Cash)
And the car came with a blunt in it (Yeah)
Lil' mama a thot, and she got ass (Thot)
And she gon' fuck up a bag (Yeah)
Pull up to the spot, livin' too fast (Yeah)
Droppin' the dope in the stash (Yeah)
In Italy, got two foreign hoes, they DM me (Ooh, brr, ayy)
Drop the top when it's cold (Drop-top)
But you feel the heat (Skrrt, yeah, ayy)
Be real with me
Keep it 100, just be real with me (Ayy)
Eat it up like it's a feast (Woah, eat it up)
They say the dope on fleek (Yep)

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Percocet pill on me (Percocet)
Ice on my neck, baby, chill with me (Ice)
Them niggas that post in the back don't say nothin'
Them niggas will kill for me
Back ends I count in my sleep, on fleek
Hundred K spent on a Patek Phillippe (Phillippe)
Bitch, I'm a dog, eat my treat (Hrr)
Hop out the frog and leap (Leap)
I put them bricks in the fender
My bitch, she walk around like she Kris Jenner (Kris Jenner)
I used to break in and enter
Then Takeoff runnin' like the game of temple (Whew)
It's simple, I play with her mental
Mama said she saw me on Jimmy Kimmel (Mama)
Count it up, 'cause I'm a money symbol
Walkin' with the racks, I'm lookin' crippled (Money)
Fuck on that bitch then I tip her (Tip her)
A nickel for me to take pictures (Nickel)
Not from L.A. but I clip her (Brr)
Double my cup, pour a triple (Actavis)
Fox on my body, no Vivica (Fox on my…)
I'm not your average or typical (I'm not your…)
Look at my wrist, and it's critical (Look at the…)
Hold it up, droppin' the temperature (Droppin' the…)
I get that bag on the regular (Bag)
I got a bag on my cellular (Brr)
Backin' up, baggin' up vegetables (Bag)
Bag of them cookies, it's medical (Cookies)
Cocaine, codeine, etcetera (White)
Cocaine and lean, it's federal (White)
I take off, landin' on Nebula
As of now twenty M's on my schedule (Takeoff)

[Chorus: Quavo & Gucci Mane]
You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it (Yeah)
Straight out the lot, three hundred cash (Cash)
And the car came with a blunt in it (Yeah)
Lil' mama a thot, and she got ass (Thot)
And she gon' fuck up a bag (Yeah)
Pull up to the spot, livin' too fast (Yeah)
Droppin' the dope in the stash (Yeah)
In Italy, got two foreign hoes, they DM me (Ooh, brr, ayy)
Drop the top when it's cold (Drop-top)
But you feel the heat (Skrrt, yeah, ayy)
Be real with me
Keep it 100, just be real with me (It's Gucci, ayy)
Eat it up like it's a feast (Hah, woah, eat it up)
They say the dope on fleek (Yep)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I know that these niggas gettin' sick of me (Eww-ah)
These chains on my neck cost a mil' a piece (Um)
I don't even like to freestyle for free
I put in the key and I ride the beat
I won't even come out the house for free
I pay a nigga to drive for me (Huh?)
JAY-Z couldn't even co-sign for me
I do what I want 'cause I'm signed to me (Damn)
I get the, I get the, I get the bag
They get the bag, have to cut it in half (Wop)
Stop the comparin', y'all makin' me laugh
Need the rehab, I'm addicted to cash
Convertible Wop, convertible top
My dope got a vertical, look at it hop
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, and it jump out the pot (Pot)
Came out of jail and went straight to the top
Take it easy, baby, middle of summer, I'm freezin', baby (Burr)
Don't leave me, baby
Just drop to your knees and please me, baby (Go)
I'm fascinated, two bitches so fine that I masturbated (Ha)
Congratulations, she brain me so good that I graduated (Wow)
They had to hate it
I don't fuck with them niggas, they plastic, baby (Heh)
A trapper, baby, I rap but I own all my masters, baby
It's tragic, baby, I pull up and fuck up the traffic, baby (Ha)
A savage, baby
I'm killin' these niggas, closed casket, baby (Wop)

[Chorus: Quavo]
You get the bag and fumble it
I get the bag and flip it and tumble it (Yeah)
Straight out the lot, 300 cash (Cash)
And the car came with a blunt in it (Yeah)
Lil' mama a thot, and she got ass (Thot)
And she gon' fuck up a bag (Yeah)
Pull up to the spot, livin' too fast (Yeah)
Droppin' the dope in the stash (Yah)
In Italy, got two foreign hoes, they DM me (Ooh, brr, ayy)
Drop the top when it's cold (drop top)
But you feel the heat (Skrrt, yah, ayy)
Be real with me
Keep it 100, just be real with me (Ayy)
Eat it up like it's a feast (Woah, eat it up)
They say the dope on fleek (Yep)
