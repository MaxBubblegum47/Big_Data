[Verse 1: Trouble]
If the price is right, I know you out right
Gonna buss it down, bless you, gesundheit
I say it ain't no fun if you ain't bustin buns
Ain't no fun if you got no for us
No love for the scrubs is it?
I unbuckle your pants, your handles love lickin
Love handles, grippin' em while I grub kitten
Thug bid'ness, nasty dealer, I love kitchens
Her kidneys, I been in'em, I love diggin
Her feelings, youll never find them, the girl livin'
I say, buss it how you want to, baby
You ain't got shit on the bill, you can't make me
Do nothing that you want me to
I do what I wanna do
Fuck your opinion, pop this shit in front of you
I got money, I got millions, I get hunnids too
All my stacks got my back

[Chorus: Trouble]
Young tender, I'ma put the whole dick in her
She gon' fuck me for some money cause that hoe shit in her
She gon' pop it, she gon' shake it cause that hoe shit in her
I'ma throw these bands at her cause I know she a winner
Young tender, I'ma put the whole dick in her
She gon' fuck me for some money cause that hoe shit in her
She gon' pop it, she gon' shake it cause that hoe shit in her
I'ma throw these bands at her cause I know she a winner

[Verse 2: Yung Miami]
Oh, you want a bad bitch that twerk
Well, nigga, pull a bag out here first
And watch this ass pop like a perc'
Girl, he really in the trap and got that work
Shine on me, daddy, talk that shit
Ball like a dog, spend it all on a bitch
Where yo cup at, daddy, fill it to the top
Go in da duffle bag, baby, spend another knot (spend it)
Pole control with it, yeah, I'm spinnin at the top
Throw some mo' money, I'ma land on your cock
Oh you want a free nut, nigga, wait for it
'Cause everything over here you gotta pay for it

[Chorus: Trouble]
Young tender I'ma put the whole dick in her
She gon' fuck me for some money cause that hoe shit in her
She gon' pop it, she gon' shake it cause that hoe shit in her
I'ma throw these bands at her cause I know she a winner
Young tender, I'ma put the whole dick in her
She gon' fuck me for some money cause that hoe shit in her
She gon' pop it, she gon' shake it cause that hoe shit in her
I'ma throw these bands at her cause I know she a winner

[Bridge: Trouble]
I told her buss it down, I need you come fuck me now (aye)
Buss it down, I need you come fuck me now (I tell her)
I told her buss it down, I need you come fuck me now
Buss it down, I need you come fuck me now
Soulja Slim, I would've had hoes for him
Rest in peace Soulja Slim, I would've had hoes for him
If the price is right, I bet I get right tonight
Aye, price is right, I bet I get right tonight
Watch me run it up

Watch the run it up

[Chorus: Trouble]
Young tender, I'ma put the whole dick in her
She gon' fuck me for some money cause that hoe shit in her
She gon' pop it, she gon' shake it cause that hoe shit in her

Young tender, I'ma put the whole dick in her
She gon' fuck me for some money cause that hoe shit in her
She gon' pop it, she gon' shake it cause that hoe shit in her
I'ma throw these bands at her cause I know she a winner
