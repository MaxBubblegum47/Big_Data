[Chorus: Tanieya Weathington]
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang over here, if you feel this then help me sing it
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang over here, if you feel this then help me sing it

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
De-de-de-detonate a nigga, we so dedicated, really am
But welcome to the party, it's the era of the legend
Every knuckle-headed nigga keep a gun up under the pillow
In the ghetto keep you head up if everything mellow
Pedal to the metal when we off to other levels
We don't settle for nothin' but perfection
Little niggas in the cut, they quicker to catch a fade
They quicker to get shot, they quicker to catch AIDS
And deep in the game, peepin' the lane all the way
The melody, the flow of the record is like hey
Nigga please, the originator do it every day and I'm a motherfucker when I get to spittin', it be gettin' it
Ma-ma-makin' sure that when my niggas sit and hear it we ain't fuckin' around, we gettin' right to the issue
First up on the order, my flow is fuckin' bananas
Did it get cha-get cha-get cha-get cha? haha
Bloody body buried in the city of the 'land
Niggas think I'm doing so bad like God damn
Don't floss, don't flam, don't flam
And it never be a reason for a hater getting jealous of me, bam
Tell 'em bout the fam'
Nigga we get that, get that
Hit of weed, hit that, hit that
Sit back relax and let me get mine, taking no shorts no losses, mane
Nigga wit' that but its just a little more than a catchy phrase
For my niggas in the clique that wonder why we never kick it like we did way back in the days
Like sellin' that, dealin' that
I said 
I give it up
, they tell me they won't give it back
What they wanna do? I'm at the corner of the club with my nigga that I love
On everything that I love, tell 'em put on the 
gloves
, and remember to aim up-up

[Chorus: Tanieya Weathington]
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang over here, if you feel this then help me sing it
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang over here, if you feel this then help me sing it

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
We the realest ever did it, we the realest on the planet
We the rebels for The Lord, never takin' it for granted
I remember way back people couldn't comprehend it
Now everybody rappin' like they really understand it
It was thug, it was managed
It was hard like a challenge
Nigga thought I would slip but my feet stay balanced
Who woulda thought we'd start a hip-hop panic
Bone Thugs drop and other crews couldn't manage
Dipped into my space, had to find another lane
Nigga bought a gun had to go back to the range
Whenever Bone change, it'll never be the same
Takin' no shorts and no losses, mane
Bang-bang-bang-bang, for the thugstas pain
Forever on the come up, nigga, we ain't playin'
And all the kids in the ghetto know the bloody murder mayhem
We represent that, that's what I'm sayin'
For the love for the soul, soldiers that ride for it
I only ride with the ones that'll die for it
I'ma whiz with the pen, you and I know it
But them player haters wanna try to deny, boy
They only hear me when I'm rackin' the pump
Who get outta line, I be sockin' 'em up
With a hologram that make me have to call Pac up
Better call Po-po 'cause you gon' need back-up
Puffin' on the buddah while I let that money stack up
Higher, higher, higher, baby
Everybody wonder how the Bone got back up
Fire and desire, baby
That's right, gotta get it gotta get it while the gettin' is good cause that's Bone
How many more niggas gon' last this long?
Nigga, we move on, we too strong
Come on, come on!

[Chorus: Tanieya Weathington]
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang over here, if you feel this then help me sing it
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang over here, if you feel this then help me sing it

[Verse: Flesh-N-Bone]
Step up, step up, anybody wit' a Bone to pick?
Now when I level my charge, I'm damn sure to make it stick
You must be lookin' to suffer, well, I'ma make it quick
Got a train load of ish that'll make you sick
I'm here to wipe 'em out quicker than a pandemic
Bo-Bo-Bo-Bone came original with a gimmick, can ya dig it?
Hell yeah, they can dig it
While I'm sittin' on my throne, steady laughin' at you niggas tryna get it
I'm stacking my figures, 
what?

[?] she like to [?], you need a sweatshop
Better sip slow mister, you lookin' at stars
So what if we are? We form constellation together like the big dipper (D-d-d-dipper)
Nigga see if you can keep up when I'm dippin'-dippin', I'm rippin' it hard
We pull up in your city wit' a convoy, makin' a lot of noise, [?] nights, we gettin' charged
I don't give a damn where you from from (Bone)
Flesh care less bout a sucker and his broke ass game
You need to get a life, get a job, get a wife
You need to get it right, make a real damn name
What you dealin' wit' 
here
 is sensational
See, I got folks in the East and the North and the South
The niggas in the 
pen
 they gon' know what I'm about
Better know what you're sayin' before you open up your mouth
They wanna-they wanna-they wanna be down wit' the Bone
But they can stay the fuck out the way, comprende?
I'm steady keepin' it caliente, all day, every day
If you rollin' it with the dawg, get your back-get your back off the wall
My nigga, don't stall, not at all
We all came here to have a motherfuckin' ball, ain't that right?
Yeah, y-y-yes y'all

[Chorus: Tanieya Weathington]
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang over here, if you feel this then help me sing it
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang over here, if you feel this then help me sing it
