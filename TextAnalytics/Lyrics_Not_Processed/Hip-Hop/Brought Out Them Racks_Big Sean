[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Your boyfriends an alcoholic
But Gucci's a reefer chiefer
Your girlfriends a penis eater
I swear she's a people pleaser
Im pourin up two liters
And riding in two seaters
Sippin on mojitos
One mill on my wife beater
Party with white people
I really don't like people
Party tonight
But you must go with the right people
Bigger than life nigga
K with a knife nigga
And he might end his own life
Found out I'm fucking his wife,Leave her
Guccis accustomed to death
Sex with no feelings attatched
Pulled to my bachelor pad
Rari the top is detatched
Bumping
And humping
And jumping
In something
Damn yo girl is one hell of a woman
Telling me something
Then telling me nothing
Got to think about something
To keep me from cumming

I bought out them racks out to play(aye mane)
I bought them racks out today (Say mane)
I put them racks in your face (aye mane)
I brought them racks out the safe (say mane)
I bought out them racks out to play (aye mane)
I bought them racks out today(say mane)
I put them racks in your face (aye mane)
I brought them racks out the safe (say mane)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ok my crib look like Bay Watch
Dont quit your day job
She walking with nothing
But she leaving my tank top
Lately I've been seeing more champagne than raindrops
B.I.G the only thing thats missing is puff saying ,"we can't stop"
Rolling with jigga but I'm not a nets fan
Everything green round me
Like I'm a jets fan
If its green then I burn it
This weed and cash I deserve it
My car and girl both german
Said she's a ____
I need a surgeon
I be running to the money
And I feel like I'm racing a turtle,
Squirtle
Boy I got so rich so early
Swear I gave my money a curfew
Now all of ya niggas alert you
Because I got the bitch you can't tame
Drunk off pussy and champagne
And you ain't gonna do a damn thang
