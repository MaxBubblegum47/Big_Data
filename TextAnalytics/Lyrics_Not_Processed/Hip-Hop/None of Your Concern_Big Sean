[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
I've been contemplatin', meditatin'
Should've waited, should've never dated
You seem irritated, baby, why you never say it?
Isn't this worth saving?
I can feel you fading off
We're not gonna make it long
Guess you cannot take it
Guess it's worth sayin'

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
It's none of your concern anymore
None of your concern
Is it even worth it at all?
Is it even worth it?
Is it gonna work anymore?
Is it gonna work?
Am I being heard anymore?
Am I being heard? Nah, yeah

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
I've been hearin' things and seeing things and so it seems you movin' on from me
Caught you on the scene with little miss thing, and trust me, she really don't want beef
That's besides the point, I'm disappointed as a homie, what is it you see?
I want better for you movin' forward, what's better for you than me?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko & 
Ty Dolla $ign
]
Guess that's none of my concern anymore
None of my concern (
It ain't worth anymore
)
It ain't even worth it no more
It ain't even worth it (
It ain't worth it
)
It don't even hurt anymore
It don't even hurt (
It don't, don't hurt
)
It ain't gonna work anymore
It ain't gonna work, yeah

[Verse 3: Jhené Aiko]
You've been hearin' things and seeing things and so it seems I'm movin' on my own
The audacity to question me, like you ain't leave me out here on my own
I was traumatized and suicidal, sick and tired, I am not to blame
Once I felt a way, but not today, I'm not afraid, now I can say
Get your bitch ass off of my phone, please leave me alone
I am not your girl anymore, you need to watch your tone
Don't worry about who it is I'm fuckin' or who I am lovin', just know that it is not you
This isn't up for discussion, I wish you good luck, man
When it comes to you

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko & 
Ty Dolla $ign
]
It's none of my concern anymore
None of my concern (
Anymore, anymore
)
I know that I'm deserving of more
I know what I deserve (
Anymore, anymore
)
Not scared to be alone anymore
Not scared to be alone (
Anymore, no, no
)
It don't even hurt anymore
It don't even hurt

[Bridge: Jhené Aiko]
Burnt out
You've been on some bullshit
Burnt out
You moved to my city
Got turnt out
Everybody know now
Word's out, it turns out

[Verse 4: Big Sean, 
Ty Dolla $ign
, 
Both
]
Ha, ha, ha, ha
, yeah
You know I had these issues when you met me (
Ooh yeah
)
Results of those post 
damages that I haven't dealt with
And I only want the best for you, movin' forward
But you backtracking with niggas that ain't shit for you, don't belong around your aura
You know there's not a day 
in these modern times
You haven't crossed my mind, we 
both crossed the line
Seems like I needed you more than I needed myself
Just like I always felt like cheatin' on you would be cheatin' myself
To me, that's just some dumb shit for you to say we done with
Tryna speak your heart
, tryna make your mark
Then go deeper and make a scar
But every time I lay down I think about you naked
And if you find my replacement, how could you?
I made you cum nine times in one day
Your two lips should come in a vase, you rode my face
I realize you look as good as you taste, hmm (
Yeah
)
Fingers all in your mouth, I'm grabbin' you up and dickin' you down
I'm grabbin' your waist, your room is my only escape
I guess that's none of your concern
