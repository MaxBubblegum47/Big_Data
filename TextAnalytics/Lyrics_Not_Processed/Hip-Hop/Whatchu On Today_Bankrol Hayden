[Chorus: Bankrol Hayden]
Whatchu on today?
My brothers just do you wrong today
You can hate it if you wanna hate
But one phone call and they on the way

[Verse 1: Bankrol Hayden]
'Cause I'm just blessed just with a gift
I remember I ain't have shit
In the mall we was stealin' hella shit
Free my brother never switch
Remember we was out here sharin' fits
Yeah, we went from bus routes to foreign whips
Way before rappin', me and Modego was up in the basement
I never knew faith could take my life and be so dangerous
'Cause that be my dawg, I switch up the cost, no replacements
Hard days to come home, it's a struggle alone locked up in them cages

[Chorus: Bankrol Hayden]
Whatchu on today?
My brothers just do you wrong today
You can hate it if you wanna hate
But one phone call and they on the way
Whatchu on today?
My brothers just do you wrong today
You can hate it if you wanna hate
But one phone call and they on the way

[Verse 2: Polo G]
I was thuggin' with the dropouts
All lurkin' with a weapon
Only degrees they know is first and second
In that field tryna do a fuckin' murder with a Wesson
My youngins heartless, they purgin' and they steppin'
If you catch a body, get a burner in the necklace
I be out in traffic with some wild adolescents
They gon' leave his mind on the curb, yeah, they reckless
He was dissing on the gang, bet that pussy learned his lesson
I wear my flag, but this Ralph Lauren, not no Hilfiger
You see me flexin', come and turn up with a real nigga
Play your cards right, 'fore them killers come and deal with ya
My homies dead, we party for 'em like they still with us

[Chorus: Bankrol Hayden]
Whatchu on today?
My brothers just do you wrong today
You can hate it if you wanna hate
But one phone call and they on the way
Whatchu on today?
My brothers just do you wrong today
You can hate it if you wanna hate
But one phone call and they on the way
