[Verse 1]
When you feel the world around you
Spinnin' out of control
You can find someone around you
To bring you out of the cold
But you don't ever have to hide
What you really feel inside

[Chorus]
So put 'em up
Two high
We can walk together with our hands up in the sky
So put 'em up
Tonight
We can come together
We won't give up on the fight

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-ooh
So put 'em up
Put 'em up
Two high

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's hard to tell
What we're really living for
Hear the voices calling out from the streets
Singin' get ready
Get ready for more
Singin' get ready
Get ready for more now

[Chorus]
So put 'em up
Two high
We can walk together with our hands up in the sky
So put 'em up
Tonight
We can come together
We won't give up on the fight

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-ooh
So put 'em up
Put 'em up
Two high
Put 'em up
Put 'em up
Two high

[Bridge]
Before we're gone
Keep holding on
Keep holding on

[Chorus]
And put 'em up
Two high
We can walk together with our hands up in the sky
So put 'em up
Tonight
We can come together
We won't give up on the fight
So put 'em up
Two high
We can walk together with our hands up in the sky
So put 'em up
Tonight
We can come together
We won't give up on the fight

[Post-Chorus]
Put 'em up
Two high
Put 'em up
Put 'em up
Two high
