[Verse 1]
We ain't perfect, but we're working on it
You got baggage, but I gotta have it
Ain't no you without a me
There ain't no such thing, mmh
It's never easy, I wouldn't want it to be
I got moodswings, but you're still rocking with me
You make me laugh when I get mad and I can't stand it, no

[Chorus]
We drive each other crazy
And that's how I like it, baby
Two broken hearts still beating, we need this
'Cause ain't no one love like we do
Do you remember summer?
We tried to escape the suburbs
But we couldn't leave your covers, or each other
'Cause ain't no one love like we do
Love like we–

[Verse 2]
Both got a past, but we're getting past them
Go get a couple of duffels and grab your passport
We don't got a destination
Pick your place and let's just go, go

[Chorus]
We drive each other crazy
And that's how I like it, baby
Two broken hearts still beating, we need this
'Cause ain't no one love like we do
Do you remember summer?
We tried to escape the suburbs
But we couldn't leave your covers, or each other
'Cause ain't no one love like we do
Love like we–

[Outro]
We drive each other crazy
And that's how I like it, baby
Two broken hearts still beating, we need this
'Cause ain't no one love like we do
