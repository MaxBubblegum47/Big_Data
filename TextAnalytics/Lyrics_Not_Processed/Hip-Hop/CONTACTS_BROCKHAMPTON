[Verse: Rodney Tenor]
I want your number in my telephone
So that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone
So that I could be the one tonight
I want your number in my telephone
So that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone
So that I could be the one tonight
I want you in my (oh, oh)
I want you in my phone, before I let you go
I want you in my phone
I want you in my, in my, in my arms again
