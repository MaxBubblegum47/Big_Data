[Verse 1]
Strictly outta curiosity
What would happen if you got with me?
Kissin' you would hit the spot with me
Come on skip a couple rocks with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me any of your heart tonight
Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
I got something we can start tonight
Lookin' at you girl, it's hard to fight

[Chorus]
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
T-shirt of your favourite rock band
Checkin' your makeup in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback

[Verse 2]
Come on baby, shoot a smile at me
Midnight selfie on a balcony
A little somethin' for my life screamin'
You're burnin' a hole in my pocket
And we've got the beat, let's drop it

[Chorus]
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
Tattoos, cut-offs, and converse
Singin' along to the song with the wrong words
Every move you make baby it works
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback

[Chorus]
Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby, they're fixed on you
In your snapback
T-shirt of your favourite rock band
Checkin' your makeup in my Ray Bans
Breakin' hearts like only you can
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback

[Outro]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
In your snapback
