[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now,  that's enough, that's enough

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Do you see what you contribute to my consciousness?
Voices feelin' so ominous
I can't place a pen for you, they mark it out as anonymous
I would shift the whole continent
If it helped you 'round with some confidence
Thinkin' bout all the consequence
Gotta try to break what's monotonous

[Verse 2: Joba]
How could I be better?
I paid the price in full, just to clear the record
Rewound just to fast forward
On the eight-track I stole from my grandmama

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Catastrophic, where the stoppin'?
Man, I wish I had a rocket
Wish I ain't feel microscopic
Wish my thoughts was telepathic
But instead I'm always babbling
Love rappin' like it's my girlfriend
Every tour is like a catfish
Just kidding, I love you assholes

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough

[Verse 4: Joba]
It's hard to air out in deep water
You keep calling, I ignore it
Cleared my conscience in absurd ways
I do the things you hate, I'm changing every day

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know where the party at)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know when we leavin', boo)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know where the party at)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know when we leavin', boo)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
