[Intro]
(
Ooh, RJ
)
Tell your bitch to look at me while I'm...
RJ always trippin', man
RJ always trippin', man
Ayy, tell your bitch to look at me while I'm speakin' to you

[Chorus]
You forgot I hit that bitch before she was your bitch
Even while you was with her, couldn't give her no dick
When you was gettin' off, I was leavin' your crib
Takin' shits on your toilet, playin' with your kids
Like tell your bitch to look at me while I'm speakin' to you
It's a lot of real shit I've been meanin' to do
You couldn't dance like me if you needed to groove
Guess I set the tone, you lil' niggas needed some moves (Ugh)

[Verse]
Guess I set the tone, chopper movin' Reggaeton
Blood on my 
herringbone
, won't leave me the hell alone
I say do it, do it, do it if that bitch wanna do it to me
Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it, you a killer, gotta prove it to me
Fuck 'round with dawg, we don't fuck 'round with law
Get that pack in or we just get that backend, no shorts
He on my end, them niggas gotta tap in, no choice
Want a damn slice, Skuba 40 make him surfboard
She want Sada dick, say that she gon' twerk for it
Hell no, lazy bitch, hit the road, work for it
Drop a four in that soda, pop a couple Percs for it
Put a 9,000 pack (Ayy) up your Bebe skirt for it (Ugh)
How a nigga lil' sister say she want some MAC makeup?
Can't get it for her, last time that we laid up
Came out the bathroom, she was on my Facebook
Cocked a right hand back, hit her with a straight hook
Bitch, don't be playin' with my money phone
That's that line I get bags and get money on
Niggas always want a snitch nigga to come home
Niggas must be snitchin' too, baby, somethin' wrong
Ayy, we do real nigga dance moves, nigga, you can't touch those
I get money, I'm as happy as my custos
Brand new rockstars with a dumb roll
I'm a rockstar, I'll hit him with a drumroll
See a opp, then it's crunch time, bag a combo
See a opp, 
then it's punch time, TJ Combo
Trap lookin' 
like the lunch line by the combos
Bet you I can fuck eight bitches with a blindfold
Hit a opp with the ugly shot like I'm Lonzo
Catch a opp in the mornin' time like Alonzo
40 make him do the 
funny dance like Alfonso
Bet you I can get eight bricks gone pronto
I do my dance way better than you do it
So bitch ass nigga, watch me do it
And I shoot my 45 way better than you
So lil' ass nigga, let me shoot it
And I'm gon' fuck your bitch way better than you
Even though you don't want me to do it
And 'bout five niggas with me right now
Got CC dubs, wanna call police, can't do it
Bitch, we legal with these straps (Ayy, uh)
Still illegal with these traps (Ayy, uh)
Shoot a nigga like it's craps (Ayy, uh)
I give hell, don't give daps (Ayy, uh)
I raise hell, don't raise kids (Ayy, uh)
Fuck her face and shoot my kids (Ayy, uh)
'Cause I dance like I did (Uh)
Make these niggas look like feds with this shit (Ayy, uh)

[Chorus]
You forgot I hit that bitch before she was your bitch (Uh)
Even while you was with her, couldn't give her no dick (Uh)
When you was gettin' off, I was leavin' your crib (Uh)
Takin' shits on your toilet, playin' with your kids (Uh)
Like tell your bitch to look at me while I'm speakin' to you (Uh)
It's a lot of real shit I've been meanin' to do (Uh)
You couldn't dance like me if you needed to groove (Uh)
Guess I set the tone, you lil' niggas needed some moves  (Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh)
