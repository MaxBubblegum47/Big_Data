[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Well, ain't no need to tell y'all that it's all the way real
That's how I make scrill, I got to pay bills
Ready to collect all of them dollar-dollar mils
So pop and just kneel
Kick back and just chill
And have a good time, toastin' to the good life
Ready to get out the hood life

Although we risin' to the top
We don't forget about the block, do you remember
We was heavy, baby, oh
Doin' what we got to do
To all my niggas, we'll be doin' nigga style for you
So come on
And pop the top off of a bottle
Hennessey, I prefer, let's toast
To the coldest, coast, to coast
Cause you know them niggas flows, the most
No joke

Repeat Hook

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Everyday, it's a like a struggle sometimes
It's just too make to take, that's why we learn from our mistakes
And know that these are the breaks
Tryin' to eat all the cake
Like everyday's a nigga birthday, give me the weed and the drank
To help me make it through my worst days
I cherish every moment
I can smile and laugh
I'm workin' hard, so I'm playin' hard
Givin' it all I have
I must confess you
Cause the Lord blessed me, shined down on me
Kept his angels lookin' over me
Since the beginning of my soldier story
I'm tryin' to get
Tryin' to live it, go beyond the glory
So pop the bottle
It's the goose, I prefer, so let's toast
To the coldest, coast, to coast
Cause you know them niggas flows the most
No joke, nigga

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
When everybody's eatin'
Man, it feels oh-so lovely
Get money for whatever, don't you worry 'bout nothin'
Lovin'
This hustlers is static, back jumpin'
You gotta love
The way we bounce back
With our harmonies and souls
Ain't no holdin' us back
Plus the shit
That I'm hearin', man, it's straight up played
The game, needs
Our harmonies, yeah, I said that
In fact, the 'Llacs
Are real from the days way back in the eighties
It was crazy
Hustlers on the corner
Gettin' money, baby
So put your cups and
If you with me, yeah, Remi's preferred
And let's toast
The coldest, coast, to coast
Cause you know them niggas flows, the most
Thugs, no joke
