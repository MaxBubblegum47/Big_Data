[Verse 1]
Well we know it ain't the first time
We know it used to be my past time
And a couple times back we agreed
That was going to be my last time
But I guess last night I plum forgot
Who's running this show and who's not

[Chorus]
Oh I must have been off of my rocker
I must have got some wires crossed
To come in hear claiming that from here on out
I'm going to be the boss
Oh it must have been me the big talker
I had a little too much of Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby
I must have been off of my rocker

[Verse 2]
No there ain't no need to stay mad
No need to waste a whole day mad
Though I have to admit honey
You look pretty darn cute mad
Oh baby working this out can't be that hard
Hahaha, I said I'm gonna be in charge

[Chorus]
Oh I must have been off of my rocker
I must have got some wires crossed
To come in hear claiming that from here on out
I'm going to be the boss
Oh it must have been me the big talker
I had a little too much of Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby
I must have been off of my rocker

[Bridge]
Oh burn it down now
Yeah I guess last night I plum forgot
Who's running this show and who's not

[Chorus]
Oh I must have been off of my rocker
I must have got some wires crossed
To come in hear claiming that from here on out
I'm going to be the boss
Oh it must have been me the big talker
I had a little too much of Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby
I must have been off of my rocker
