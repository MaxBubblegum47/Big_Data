[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
I'm taking a swig of the burb word
Downin' my fifth and I swerve
Drunk as I bend on the curb
Get up to purchase some herbs
To ease up my nerves
While a nigga got rocks to serve
Heard about thugs and hustlas
But never knew none like us before
We junking them off in dumpsters
Suck these thuggish ruggish nuts
Peep this cut
Make a nigga wanna do some dirt
Puttin' in work gotta hit 'em where it hurts
Puttin' it down Bone first
And I hit 'em wid the Ouija curse them worse to worst
Dog if you wanting to test Bone
The con-se-sequences are fatal
Ready be strapped papped wid me sawed off
Clack back cause I believe in me label
Ruthless, and we steady be puttin' it down
Just for the love of money yeah
For the love of the wasteland Claire
For the love that brought me here
Droppin' piece to the double Glock
Ready when the trouble knocks pop pop ya pistol now
If a nigga wanna run up gun up
Put him on the ground make him lay down stay down
Harmony smooth wid the thug shit
Mo murda to the fool that clone
Five niggas loc'd out wid the roughness
And it's war tryin' crab these Bones
Bring on ya stretchers ya dearly departed
Ya rest in the coffin for daring to cross this
Come and get that ass tossed by the boss bitch
Ain't taking no shorts or no losses

[Hook]
Bone come break 'em down
Taking no shorts no losses man

[Verse 4: Flesh N Bone]
Remember when that dog jumped out of the darkside
Come creep in the barrel bitch if you test my hood
It'll be your loss, even if you bring your clik
Get tossed and it'd do you no good
Can't fuck wid my gang no thang
And the bullets they ring out
Strangle the man, and drug 'em up off the Claire
We strip 'em and beat they brains out
I gotta give p's to all ah my Trues
Steadily paying them dues
We niggas wid nothing to loose
Trippin' and sippin' on brews and actin' a fool
Mo Thug be loving to smoke mo bud, fiend for the green leaves
Nigga quick pull out them trees

Bone y'all Bone nigga that's startin' some shit up what?

Runnin' up out the cut pumpin' bucks
Ready ta fuck you up must bust them
And steady be dumping thuggin on the Claire, oh yeah
Let's smoke out on 88th jumping, wid playas
Whena me forty four let go
Feelin' the Glock Glock roll
95th gunning outta the window
We peep out the few coming outta the back do'
Hang, on the darkside ride
Pick up your tec and let fly, why?
I, die, by all ah my, unremorsefullest times on the nine nine
Ride, me killa, gravedigga nigga, coming up out my trench
Rest in peace and runnin' from the holice
Jumping that barbed wire fence
Hittin' the pavement dazed, the guage was blazing
Gotta watch for the po-po raising up up on me
Turn around and face 'em
Pump pump and fade 'em now
