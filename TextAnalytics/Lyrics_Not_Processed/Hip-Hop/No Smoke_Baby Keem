[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You show me some late night photos (Ayy)
Wish I saved the picture on my old phone
Wish I had the picture from your rose gold (Ayy)
Why they hatin' on me?

[Chorus]
They want no smoke
They want no smoke
(They want no) No smoke
No, no, no, no, no smoke (They want no smoke)
They want no smoke
No, no, no smoke (Hey)

[Verse]
Get up out my bidness, yeah, get up out my bidness (Out my bidness)
All my hoes back, can you get in where you fit in? (Yeah)
Ain't no time (Time), tell me that it's mine (Mine)
Hey, when I push up on it, know you feelin' fine (Fine)
Yeah, they all face me, I cannot face them (Oh)
All my bitches pray for me (Oh), I cannot pray for them (Oh, oh)
I can't face them, I know I can space them
On my momma though, never gonna chase them (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
No smoke
They want no smoke (They want no smoke)
You show me some late night photos (Rose gold)
Wish I saved the picture on my old phone
No smoke
They want no smoke (They want no smoke)
No smoke
No, no, no, no, no smoke (No smoke)
They want no smoke
No, no, no smoke (Hey)

[Bridge]
Beat the Cali, zoom-zoom, zoom-zoom
I light up, when I roll, on that vroom-vroom
All that vroom-vroom, she gon' zoom, see where I let go (Hey)
Listen to the ho in her feelings (Hol' up, hol' up), it ain't fair, oh no-no
Get up out my bidness, yeah
Get up out my bidness (Hol' up, hol' up)
Get up out my bidness, yeah (Hol' up, hol' up)
Get up out my bidness (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
No smoke, oh-oh
They want no smoke (No, no, no)
No smoke
No, no, no, no, no smoke (No smoke)
They want no smoke
No, no, no smoke (Hey)

[Outro]
Mm, yeah
Hmm
