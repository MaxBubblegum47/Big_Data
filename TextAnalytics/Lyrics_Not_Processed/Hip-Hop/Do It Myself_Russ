[Intro]
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't need her, I don't need him
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
No one's got this, no one's got that
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone scared, everyone pussy
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone watch, just keep looking
Fuck it, I'll do it myself

[Post-Chorus]
No one taught me, I was like damn
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
No one puttin' me on, damn
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone scared to go talk to her
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone scared to be number one
Fuck it, I'll do it myself

[Verse 1]
Woah, 'bout to cash out every month off of coats
I been on this way before I had hoes
Way before gin, way before smoke
Fuck it I'll do it myself
Ooh, everyone lookin' at me confused
Came a long way from 100 views
Fuck me? Shit, then fuck you too
Fuck it, I'll do it myself

[Chorus]
I don't need her, I don't need him
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
No one's got this, no one's got that
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone scared, everyone pussy
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone watch, just keep looking
Fuck it, I'll do it myself

[Post-Chorus]
No one taught me, I was like damn
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
No one puttin' me on, damn
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone scared to go talk to her
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone scared to be number one
Fuck it, I'll do it myself

[Verse 2]
Facts, whole game hittin' up my phone because my hooks, beats, and my raps
Only reason I pick up is ‘cause my family needs the cash
I just stumbled on my ex’s page, that ass is gettin' fat
Dreams I used to chase, stopped runnin’ so now y'all are gettin' lapped
I always step up I’m clutch, this is planned, this isn’t luck
My adviser is my gut, please don't ever interrupt
I got businesses galore, I just opened up my store
'Bout to see the world on tour, y'all do too much, I just record

[Chorus]
I don't need her, I don't need him
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
No one's got this, no one's got that
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone scared, everyone pussy
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone watch, just keep looking
Fuck it, I'll do it myself

[Post-Chorus]
No one taught me, I was like damn
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
No one puttin' me on, damn
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone scared to go talk to her
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone scared to be number one
Fuck it, I'll do it myself

[Chorus]
I don't need her, I don't need him
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
No one's got this, no one's got that
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone scared, everyone pussy
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
Everyone watch, just keep looking
Fuck it, I'll do it myself
