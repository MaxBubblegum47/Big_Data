[BECKY]
Go ahead
Throw your rocks at me
From your little glass house
And then take off running
You're no better than me
We've both made mistakes, haven't we?

I won't undo what I'm doin'
Sit in judgment of what makes us human
I don't claim to be proud, but
My head won't be hung in shame

I didn't plan it
But the light turned red, and I ran it
And I'm still standing
It's not what I wanted, but now that it's right here

I understand it
A story written by my own hand
It's life biting right at your heels
I didn't plan it
But it's finally something to feel
Oh

Look around you
Ain't no saints here, baby
We're all just looking for a little less crazy
And sometimes, it's a hard left turn
Down a road you never thought you'd see

I didn't plan it
Taking back what's been taken for granted
And I can't stand it
I'm sick of the way I've been waiting to break free
I needed saving
And a good mistake needed making
Maybe you need the same thing

Something to feel
To race through your blood
And remind you you're here
To open your eyes and look around
And see the sky when you're underground

I didn't plan it
But that's life
And I'm finally feeling alive
It's not right, but it's mine
And it's finally something to feel
