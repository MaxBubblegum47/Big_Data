[Intro]
Ayo turn the tune off on this part (yeah yeah)
Uh uh uh
Jump jump jumpin' yeah it's active huh
Yeah jump jumping wit it (yeah yeah)

[Verse 1]
This shit jumping yeah it's active
Heard you asked bout Alexa, but that bitch past tense
These days are more of menages
Got my foot on the gas with the gas on cautious
‘Y’all nowadays make me nervous
Gotta trial with the law, they gon’ drop all the charges
Hoes nowadays want the cashes
Gotta call from my dog who supply all my sauces

[Chorus]
Ah Can’t lose, I got juice
And they know I do yeah
Ah Can’t lose, I got juice
And they know I do
Come through with your posse
Get nasty
‘Cause I got the sauce, yeah
Ah Can’t lose, I got juice
And they know I do

[Verse 2]
Y’all nowadays make me anxious
I'ma need more space, so the new place spacious
Y’all nowadays imitations
When it come to the real, know it ain’t no replacin’
Too much sauce on the roster
Like the rasta is pasta, I whip with my dawns, yeah
I’m only here for it all, yeah
All y’all want it all drop the ball in the process

[Chorus]
Ah Can’t lose, I got juice
And they know I do yeah

[Bridge]
Hold up, I do this, I’m the best and you knew this
I pull up in that newness, like get in girl what you doin’
Champagne campaign, ain’t worried ‘bout a damn thang
Got the diamonds dancin', got the girls dancin’
(I make ‘em do it)
She shake it, make it jiggle, make it pop
She drop it low, I’m throwin’ money nonstop
Work, work, work, work, that’s a lot
You deserve somethin’ new off the lot

[Chorus]
Ah Can’t lose, I got juice
And they know I do yeah
Ah Can’t lose, I got juice
And they know I do
