[Intro]
Real hittas with me and they might shoot
Great John on the beat, by the way
I got some real hittas with me and they might shoot

[Bridge]
Gang living, hate it when she got addicted
And she gon' get down, call a friend to come and get her, ooh
That's your bestie, I'ma have to pick her
She said "don't neglect me," she said don't forget her
I'm there when you get a jet ski, better respect me
Money coming fast, moving slow, you getting left-y

[Verse 1]
They say that they love me, that's a lie
Keep my money wrapped up like a mummy, dead guys
In my pocket, I'ma stack it 'til my hundreds hit the sky
Remember she ain't want me, used to leave a nigga dry
Now she something like a bird, if I call, she'll fly
Pull up, what's the word, pray to God you don't die
I know they don't wanna see a nigga make it out the slums
Wanna see me dead or in jail, anyone
How you getting all that bread, wanna give a nigga crumbs
Shooters hit you close range with a and-1
Look

[Chorus]
Gang living, hate it when she got addicted
And she gon' get down, call a friend to come and get her, ooh
That's your bestie, I'ma have to pick her
She said "don't neglect me," she said don't forget her
I'm there when you get a jet ski, better respect me
Money coming fast, moving slow you getting left-y
Gang living, hate it when she got addicted
And she gon' get down, call a friend to come and get her, ooh

[Verse 2]
That's your... that's your bestie
All up on my news feed, body like a Pepsi
Know she fell in love with the gang
And she gon' do it all, we don't even know her name
Tell lil' mama get involved, pull up with a couple broads
Nigga you a fraud, you ain't who you say you are
We was probably playing blackjack, pull a nigga cards
You don't know the deal, you ain't seen a nigga scars
You don't know a nigga pain, free the gang
I was with them real hittas, tryna bust a nigga brain
Free 'Low fresh up out the chain, ain't say a thing
I'm tired of shooting 30's, for Christmas I want a K

[Chorus]
Gang living, hate it when she got addicted
And she gon' get down, call a friend to come and get her, ooh
That's your bestie, I'ma have to pick her
She said "don't neglect me," she said don't forget her
I'm there when you get a jet ski, better respect me
Money coming fast, moving slow you getting left-y
Gang living, hate it when she got addicted
And she gon' get down, get down, get down...
