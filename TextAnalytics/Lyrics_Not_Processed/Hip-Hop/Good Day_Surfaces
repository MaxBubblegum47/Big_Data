[Verse 1: Forrest]
Spent all of our time outside all day
Doin' whatever we like our way
Didn't need a wall to build a new space
Every moment just came together like
Two feet hangin' in the water
A few trees stood a little taller
New breeze feels so good
Can't help but remind me

[Chorus: Forrest]
That it was a good day (Yeah)
Not much to do but just lay around
Yeah, it was a good day
I'm so glad the sun stayed around
Yeah, it was a good day
Not much to do but just lay around
Yeah, it was a good day
I'm so glad the sun stayed around

[Verse 2: Forrest]
No more school, no more rules
No more room to feel these blues
You and views all afternoon
Look at all the time we don't have to give up
Everything we're given is enough
Moments fit together like a glove
All my questions answered by this love

[Chorus: Forrest]
It was a good day (Yeah)
Not much to do but just lay around
Yeah, it was a good day
I'm so glad the sun stayed around
Yeah, it was a good day
Not much to do but just lay around
Yeah, it was a good day
I'm so glad the sun stayed around
