[Intro]
DJ Bugsy
Swish
Hehehe

[Chorus]
I just lost my dawg
Nigga my brother taught me how to chase the bag
Get right in the field I had to make a bag
The day he lost his soul wish I could take it back
I just wanna go get one more bag wit' my nigga
Wanna be rich forever for my dawg
Posed to take you on you first trip on a private jet
I vow to always ball until I fall

[Verse 1]
And we been on this money shit for years
Got to drink this mud to make the pain go away
I been dropping these codeine tears
Praying Roddy Ricch don’t go insane today
We was in the high speed like fuck the static
He wanted the Rollie, I wanted the Patek
Got to get this safe my nigga fuck around and drag it
I done seen a lot of shit behind these glasses yeah
My life goin' through many different phases
Got to keep the gun on me, can’t go too many places
Runnin' V12’s just to mimic drag races
Nigga we was bag chasers before we had braces

[Chorus]
I just lost my dawg
Nigga my brother taught me how to chase the bag
Get right in the field I had to make a bag
The day he lost his soul wish I could take it back
I just wanna go get one mo’ bag wit' my nigga
Wanna be rich forever for my dogs
Posed to take you on you first trip on a private jet
I vow to always ball until I fall

[Verse 2]
Got the Burberry jacket and an Ace of Spade
Get a hundred racks, I got to make it today
Got to get a tennis bracelet punch you right in the face
My dawg looked out for me when I ain’t have nothin'
Pass on thirty, then he pulled up in a jag or somethin'
When the opps seen him pull up cold, nigga, they was mad or somethin'
We was countin' them hundreds back at Steelo’s crib
I wanted to drip with my brother in Valentino for real
Remember I was talking to him on the jail phone on Christmas
Said when he get out we gon' add the check up like arithmetic
If you try to rob a nigga I vow to get the stick
I might slide on a nigga like a rip stick
I don't know why all these legends always got to die young yeah
Nigga got to cut these snakes up out the grass
Out of everybody, I suspected you last
Supposed to take all these flights in first class

[Chorus]
I just lost my dawg
Nigga my brother taught me how to chase the bag
Get right in the field I had to make a bag
The day he lost his soul wish I could take it back
I just wanna go get one mo’ bag wit' my nigga
Wanna be rich forever for my dogs
Posed to take you on you first trip on a private jet
I vow to always ball until I fall
