[Verse 1: Ann Marie]
Show me somethin' real
Somethin' that's worth my time
I know sometimes I drive you crazy, baby
Are you down for the ride?
Promise me whenever I need you, you won't hesitate to slide
I met a lot of lame niggas claimin' that they real niggas
But that shit was fu, so shawty, tell me what it is with you
Can you be that? Boy, you know I need that
When you say you love me, shawty, show me that you mean that
Show you mean that, boy, I need that
When you say you love me, shawty, show me that you mean that
All this built-up love
Stay low, stack, and go hard
I wanna be the one make you cum

[Chorus: Ann Marie]
Just need some loyal dick
Someone who gon' ride for me
Boy, just match my loyalty
Swear you won't give up on me, boy, I
Just need some loyal dick
Someone who gon' ride for me
Boy, just match my loyalty
Swear you won't give up on me

[Verse 2: Yung Bleu]
Loyalty
You makin' it hard for me
But you a lil' caramel like I like my girls
You really need to rock my world
Fuck you in the kitchen with the dishes on the counter
You done threw the first lick and I hit you with a counter
Switch and hit you on the counter 'cause you love rough sex
I'ma hit you with a latex
I gave you love and you cannot replace that
Ignore my call, I pull up where your place at
Back to back orgasm, no, you can't fake that
Scorpio, girl, I can tell how you take that
Go for two rounds, after that, we can shake back, one more time
Don't listen to your friends, they tell you lies
I'm lookin' for a shawty that's gon' ride

[Chorus: Ann Marie]
Just need some loyal dick
Someone who gon' ride for me
Boy, just match my loyalty
Swear you won't give up on me, boy, I
Just need some loyal dick
Someone who gon' ride for me
Boy, just match my loyalty
Swear you won't give up on me

[Verse 3: Ann Marie]
Don't give up on me, show you fuck with me
If you stay down, then you know what's up with me
Keep it real with me, baby, build with me
You a hood nigga, love the way you deal with me
Make your words match your actions
Boy, don't say it if it can't happen
Fuck me good, make this ass fatter, and that's better

[Chorus: Ann Marie]
Just need some loyal dick
Someone who gon' ride for me
Boy, just match my loyalty
Swear you won't give up on me, boy, I
Just need some loyal dick
Someone who gon' ride for me
Boy, just match my loyalty
Swear you won't give up on me
Just need some loyal dick
Someone who gon' ride for me
Boy, just match my loyalty
Swear you won't give up on me, boy, I
Just need some loyal dick
Someone who gon' ride for me
Boy, just match my loyalty
Swear you won't give up on me
