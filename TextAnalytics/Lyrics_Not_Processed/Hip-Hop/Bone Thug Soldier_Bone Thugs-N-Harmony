[Krayzie Bone]
Finger on the trigger from my 9-millimeter make your +Body Rott+
(Body Rott) And when you drop, make the party stop
Leave 'em in the bushes, we them niggas makin pushes in your squad (squad)
Catch a nigga sleep, he truly die
Wake up inside the coffin, don't make my niggas start it
They doin this regarded, tossed him back and lost it
Awww shit, my niggas they get the ammo
We takin over the panel, thuggin on every channel
Invasion, "Thug on Da Line"
Put it down for the nation, "Thugs All Ova Da World"
The Thugs, they cool and the only thing we smoke will be the bud
But trip and we gon' rip shit up, shit up

[Chorus]

[Wish Bone]
Snatch a nigga, break a nigga, show him how we do
Take that, eat that, rob and take it to your crew
Nothin new, nothin new, we not sayin nothin new
But when the Thugs get after you (oh my God!)
Don't you know that you can stick a nigga, hit him from the back, take that
And I'm a real thug before all this rap, believe that
And I will kill niggas, ah-ah-ah, we steal nigga
Don't believe nigga? Pap-pap-pap, believe now nigga?
