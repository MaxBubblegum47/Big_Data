[Intro: Cardo & Baby Keem]
Gotta talk about gettin' this money, man
Got a lil' play real quick
If I was you, I'd call back ASAP, nigga
Cardo
Shoot through your car door, shoutout to Cardo
Cardo got wings

[Chorus]
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch, ayy
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch, ayy
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch

[Verse]
Uh, she gave me head like once, I'm tryna get it like twice (Woah)
Baby, come earn your stripes, I'm a thief in the night

Pussy wet like ice, woah, pussy wet like ice
Back it up, baby, that's all I know (Yeah), trap phone boomin', that's all I know (Woah)
I want her friend, all I know (Yeah), type my [?], all I know (Woah)
Your bitch fiendin', all I know, money go zoom, that's all I know
Take it and see how far I go, take it and see how far I go

[Chorus]
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch, ayy
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch, ayy
Don't you tell my register, don't you tell my bitch
