[Intro: Ugly God]
Young Ugly God, bruh
I made this beautiful beat by myself
I don't care if you goin' to Harvard University
I don't care if you got A-honor roll
All I care about is face, titty, booty, and toes

[Chorus: Ugly God]
Face, titties, booty and toes
Titties and booty and toes
Titties and booty and toes
Face, titties, booty, toes
Titties, booty, toes
Titties and booty and toes
Titties and booty and toes
Face, titties, booty, toes
Face, titties, booty, toes
Face, titties, booty, toes
Face, titties, booty, toes

[Verse 1: Ugly God]
Young Ugly God, man
You already know what it is
Face, titties, booty, toes
It's the only thing I'm lookin' for in a female
I don't care if you bald-headed wi' one arm
If you toes look good
I'm trying to get yo number bitch
I don't care about ya problems
Or what's goin' on at home
It don't matter how you dress
Don't give a fuck about ya clothes
I don't care about ya heart
Nor do I care about ya soul
All I care about is face, titties, booty and ya toes

[Verse 2: Ugly God]
Ugly God came in, dick game malicious
If I come over better know I'm on a mission
Booty so delicious but yo toes look suspicious
Face, titties, booty, toes, damn you finger lickin'
Excuse me baby girl, I seen yo' booty from a distance
Pleased to meet you, would you like to be one of my bitches
Lock me in ya titties, bitch I wanna be in prison
Young Ugly God grab ya ass without permission
Young Ugly God dick hard like a comet
Bitch I might suck on ya toes if they flawless
Ugly God sniff on yo titties in the closet
Young Ugly God, bitch my dick microscopic

[Chorus: Ugly God]
Face, titties, booty and toes
Titties and booty and toes
Titties and booty and toes
Face, titties, booty, toes
Titties, booty, toes
Titties and booty and toes
Titties and booty and toes
Face, titties, booty, toes
Face, titties, booty, toes
Face, titties, booty, toes
Face, titties, booty, toes
