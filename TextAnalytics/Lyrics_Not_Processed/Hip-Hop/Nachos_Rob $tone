[Hook]
Downtown in the whip, this bitch copped out a week ago
Damn she so ignorant, finessed her and she didn't know
Served my plate with paper on the side cause I like dinner rolls
But really though, I burn the stove
Be down to roll a swisher hoe
Bad bitch from Mexico, no habla any english though
Know she wanna get down with the squad cause we be gleamin'  hoe
Steamin' boats but I got the key like I'm a teacher hoe
This reefer though, it got me cool like water through the seasons hoe
What you speakin' bro
Boy I'll have you shook like Ricky hoe
Sticky icky hoe
White widow with my windows low
I'm sippin', whippin' slow
Whippin' win like mega millions hoe
2 mobile phones but don't you dare not share my digits hoe
