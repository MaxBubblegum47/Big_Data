[Verse 1]
Well, I met her in the garden
Underneath that old apple tree
Sittin' with a handful of flowers
Lookin' as cool as can be
We talked away a couple of hours
Then she laid her hand on my lap
Oh, I thought, "I got to be dreaming"
I didn't know I fell in her trap

[Pre-Chorus]
Then she made me say things I didn't want to say
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play

[Chorus]
She was a soul stripper, she took my heart
She was a soul stripper, and tore me apart

[Verse 2]
She started movin' nice and easy
Slowly getting near to my spine
Killin' off each last little feeling
Ooh, every one she could find
And when she had me hollow and naked, yeah
That's when she put me down
Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me
Stuck it in and turned it around

[Pre-Chorus]
Then she made me say things I didn't want to say
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play

[Chorus]
She was a soul stripper, she took my heart
She was a soul stripper, and tore me apart

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Soul stripper, soul stripper
Soul stripper, soul stripper
Soul stripper, soul stripper
Took out my heart
And tore it apart

[Chorus]
Soul stripper, soul stripper
Soul stripper
