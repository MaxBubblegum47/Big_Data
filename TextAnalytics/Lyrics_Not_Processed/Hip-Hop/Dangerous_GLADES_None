[Verse 1]
We fight over nothing but nothing of worth
Got carried away by the tides of our hurt
I tread ever lightly on words that I'd say
So careful
Couldn't let them go to waste

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you lend me something that I used to know?
I'm missing all that we used to do

[Chorus]
Take me back before we burn out
You and me are running weightless
It’s not sensible
We’re making memories in the mayhem
You’re showing me dangerous
Got me dancing fine lines
Way too venturous
Took me to cloud nine

[Verse 2]
We’re running on fumes, still refusing to see
The signs that relentlessly tell us to leave
I’m holding to everything making us close
So carefully
I can’t let this go to waste

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you lend me something that I used to know?
I'm missing all that we used to do

[Chorus]
Take me back before we burn out
You and me are running weightless
It’s not sensible
We’re making memories in the mayhem
You’re showing me dangerous
Got me dancing fine lines
Way too venturous
Took me to cloud nine

[Bridge]
There’s danger by my side
It’s dangerous if I look away
If I look away
There’s danger by my side
It’s dangerous if I look away
If I look away

[Chorus]
Take me back before we burn out
You and me are running weightless
It’s not sensible
We’re making memories in the mayhem
You’re showing me dangerous
Got me dancing fine lines
Way too venturous
Took me to cloud nine
You’re showing me dangerous
Got me dancing fine lines
Way too venturous
Took me to cloud nine
