[Intro: The Weeknd]
Yeah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, yeah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
If I'ma talk, I'ma talk, I'ma keep it real
Me and my boys, and my boys, we would split a pill
Noodles and pots in a pot was a nigga meal
Now that we on, that we on, we gon' split a mill'
I take a jet, take a jet when I'm overseas
None of my girls, of my girls gon' get over me
Shout-out to Hawk, shout-out Dooly, shout-out Hennessy
Them be my bros, be my bros 'til the death of me
Nobody, nobody know how I really be
I got some bars for a nigga if he wanna see
Dress up your talk if a nigga wanna talk to me
Fuck your phone calls, I don't want apologies
Everyone said, yeah, they said I was gonna peak
Most number ones, number ones in a nigga league
I think your girl, think your girl, fell in love with me
She say my fuck, and my tongue game a remedy

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh yeah, yeah
I just hit a lick, and I know you feelin' some way
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
I just took that chick, and I know you feelin' some way, oh yeah
She just want a nigga like me, you feelin' some way, way, way
She just want a nigga like me, I play no

[Verse 2: Nav]
Way, we got 'em feelin' some way
Way, 'cause you see XO in the place, told her, "Wait"
I gotta get myself together, it's a date
I spent two thousand on a sweater, way
I think the belts inside the store look better on my waist
I think my nuts look better on her face
This bitch got addicted, all she did was take a taste
Now you gettin' mad because you got replaced
The brown boy and the Starboy on a track
Haters gonna say "this shit is wack"
I went to the hills straight from the trap
I'ma fuck your bitch and give her back
She said she pop pills, I told her "Stop it"
Check my little pocket, I got options
I'm the first brown boy to get it poppin'
If I say the word, my shooters gonna pop 'em

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh yeah, yeah
I just hit a lick, and I know you feelin' some way
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
I just took that chick, and I know you feelin' some way, oh yeah
She just want a nigga like me, you feelin' some way, way, way
She just want a nigga like me, I play no games
