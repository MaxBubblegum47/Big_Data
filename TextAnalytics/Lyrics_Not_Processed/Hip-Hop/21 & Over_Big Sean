[Intro: 
Detroit Emeralds
]
There's a little for me somewhere
There's a sweet little girl who really cares
She goin' to Heaven, where I'm all alone
Gonna stand besides me, make her hot at home
I don't care, wake up
It's Big Sean

[Chorus 1: Big Sean]
She under 21, nigga
She under 21, uh
Started to leave, she said she won't believe that my friends and me
Under 21

[Verse: Big Sean & 
Detroit Emeralds
]
Ain't my girl, so it's no lies
Always dressed up but with her, it's no ties
Got up in the game, she ain't finna foul her
Got a couple friends, go ahead and divide 'em up
There's much suggested, I'm well respected
She know I can get more connects than I dialed up (Damn)
And she prolly got a dream to follow, huh
At the same or at least model
Prolly a model so she prolly'll swallow
More than her pride for the end of the night, right?
Man, she so naive, finna hit the club with a bog-ID
She prolly better off with no ID
Tryna make a Bill like Mr. O'Reilly, damn
She need a man, I hope that she find one
I'm nineteen, paid like I'm ninety one, so huh

[Chorus 2: Big Sean & 
Detroit Emeralds
]
I'm under (
21
) but my money over (
21
)
She think that she grown, live off paying the phone bill but still
She under (
21, 21
), nigga, she under (
21
)
Started to leave, she said she won't believe that my friends and me
Is under (
21
)

[Outro: Big Sean & 
Detroit Emeralds
]
Nigga, nigga
Just my live for twenty years
I've got to find now, don't care how I live
You won't be able to hide
