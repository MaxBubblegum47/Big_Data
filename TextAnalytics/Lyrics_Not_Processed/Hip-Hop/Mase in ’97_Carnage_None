[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Don't you hate when a bitch thinks that we need you?
Bitch, hop on your knees, all this dick, I'ma feed you
You open book, bitch, it's so easy to read you
Not once in my life have I thought I should please you
I'm all 'bout my 'fetti, like Migos, we ready
She suck like spaghetti, Armani, Gianni, stuff it all in Stefani
Bitch, I'm so original, just like Fani
I might catch a body, I'm lyin', I'm too rich for that
I need two bricks for that, I hit two licks with that
What you call your life savings, bought two whips with that
I rub on her clit, 'cause I like her response
Drive with the top down when I ride through Ponce
Got a pond of the Fiji, just left of the tiki
Keep Perry with me, he 'bout green like Luigi
I'm knowing you see me, bitch nigga can't be me

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Run the city up, we don't give a fuck (Bitch)
Knuck if you buck, knock a nigga stuck
Give a fuck 'bout luck, stomp 'em out his stuff (Three)
Throw your hood up, nigga, throw your hood up (Letâ€™s go)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Real motherfucker, I'm too quick to duck her
I'll pluck her then suck her, but naw, I won't cuff her
I'm first in the race
I get bored too quick, that's why I can't stay in place
I'm holy like Mase
I know more stars than space
That'll smile in your face
But diss faster than Simon
I don't eat no salmon
I don't wear no Calvin's, I'm lead role like Alvin
These niggas think thousands, I'm thinkin' 'bout millies
With Uzi in Philly
My mouth lookin' chilly, these niggas look silly
Big shouts out to Glizzy, Tokyo, and Rizzy
I'm rappin' so fast, got that stupid hoe dizzy
Her hair looking frizzy
Fifty gang with me, fifty gang with me
Bet you can't choose which one of us got the semi
Bitch got more head than Jimmy
Bitch granting wishes like Timmy, fuck you

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Run the city up, we don't give a fuck (Bitch)
Knuck if you buck, knock a nigga stuck
Give a fuck 'bout luck, stomp 'em out his stuff
Throw your hood up, nigga, throw your hood up
