[Intro: Jason Derulo & 
Soaky Siren
]
Derulo
Whine fa me darlin'
Way you move ya spine is alarmin'
Mi wan you just...

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
Big fat thang, overflowin'
Skin tight dress, couldn't hold it
Way too thick like it's swollen
Girl, you're too bad and you know it
When you drop down, lose focus
When that thing clap, that's a bonus
Mmm, that cake looking appetizing
Backpack full, that's a crisis

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Bring that body my way
Can't take it off my brain
Look like you do ballet, yeah

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Hold tight when you tip toe (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Shake something when you tip toe (girl, oh, oh, oh, oh)
No breaks when you push that back
Left, right, do it just like that
Hold tight when you tip toe (oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
Ayo, God bless you from behind and (I do)
One hand up like the Heisman (touchdown)
First class seat when ya ridin' (oh yeah)
Wind that thing like ya spineless

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Bring that body my way (my way)
Can't take it off my brain (my brain)
Look like you do ballet, yeah

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Hold tight when you tip toe (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Shake something when you tip toe (girl, oh, oh, oh, oh)
No breaks when you push that back (that back)
Left, right, do it just like that (like that)
Hold tight when you tip toe (oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge: Soaky Siren]
Whine fa me darlin'
Way you move ya spine is alarmin'
Mi wan you just whine fa me, darlin' (oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 3: Jason Derulo & (French Montana)]
Oooh, one, tryna figure out who to give ya love
Two, dancin' like a freak 'til a quarter past
Three, you know I'm the one you been looking for
(Montana, ha)

[Verse 4: French Montana & 
Jason Derulo
 & 
Both
]
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek (oh, no)
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek (ayy, ayy)
Tip toe (tip toe), tip toe (tip toe)
Chains on, got me lookin' like a disco (a disco)
Who that be? And that drop be Mansory (skrrt)
Who that be? Blowin' gas out the 'rari (sk-skrrt)
French vanilla smooth like a 100-year whine
Come sneak up from behind, "What's ya name?"
"What's ya sign?" (Huh)
Whine fa me, darlin'
"You want to dock in or fly out??"
Whine fa me, darlin'
"Baby, you want to lease, rent, or buy out??"
Whine fa me, darlin'
When dat money keep blowin', swat, why shorty tip toein'
Got ya left cheek shown, mama

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Bring that body my way (my way)
Can't take it off my brain
Look like you do ballet, oh

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Hold tight when you tip toe (when you tip toe, shake something) (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Shake something when you tip toe (when you tip toe) (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Uh, no breaks when you push that back (that back)
Left, right, do it just like that (like that)
Hold tight when you tip toe (when you tip toe) (oh, oh, oh, oh)

Soaky Siren
