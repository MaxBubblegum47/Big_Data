I'd sell my soul
For a slice of heaven tonight
My mind is shot
Cause all I've got is you in my sight
Girl you're like a pearl on the bottom of the ocean
Waiting to be found
All you needed was somebody who could see you
Who wasn't scared to dive down
I'm gonna find a million ways to love you
I need time for every part of you
I'm gonna find a million ways to love you
I ain't giving up, giving up, giving up tonight
I'm gonna find a million ways to love you
I need time for every part of you
I'm gonna find a million ways to love you
I ain't giving up, giving up, giving up tonight
I ain't giving up, giving up, giving up tonight
I know people talk
They can say the craziest things
Believe when I say
The truth is written on my skin
Girl you're like a pearl on the bottom of the ocean
Waiting to be found
All you needed was somebody who could see you
Who wasn't scared to dive down
I'm gonna find a million ways to love you
I need time for every part of you
I'm gonna find a million ways to love you
I ain't giving up, giving up, giving up tonight
I'm gonna find a million ways to love you
I need time for every part of you
I'm gonna find a million ways to love you
I ain't giving up, giving up, giving up tonight
I'm gonna find a million ways
I'm gonna find a million ways
I'm gonna find a million ways
I'm gonna find a million ways
I'm gonna find a million ways to love you
I need time for every part of you
I'm gonna find a million ways to love you
I ain't giving up, giving up, giving up tonight
