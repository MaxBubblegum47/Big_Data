Lets do it

And Im good

You keep countin' that money, I'mma kill these niggas

[Big Sean]
Okay, Im young and rich, and this the shit man
What what, you you? you, you is a shit stain
Me im connected like I switched planes
Addicted to weed, bitches and big chains
Car so big Id crash if I switch lanes
Sayin' you the man nigga, quit playing
How you winning If I ain't switch teams
Bitch I had the same dream since I was sixteen
Rippin' life out of the plastic
Turnin' everything to platnuim
Got six rings do I look like Phil Jackson?
Meat Earl Mac and bunch of Tony Braxtons
Fill your cup to the f-f-fullest
Tell them if they actin' up and p-p-pull it
High off money, weed and, p-p-pussy
I didn't studder, so girl just d-d-do it right now

[Hook]
I used to seem to wonder what it feel like
Now I do what the fuck I feel like
Forever Reppin' When Im gone
I promise I'mma bring it back to home
And have my mother fucking weed rolled up and my champagne popping
I can't forget the girls, all around the world
Reppin' for my city, puttin' on with my crew
And I'mma keep this money just to blow it with them too

[Jwan]
And when I see you and the last time
I never lead a state where bags climb?
And this my city when Im in it nigga stand down
All of my niggas, a lot of money and bad broads
I stunt hard like I got a fucking sad car
Money will turn you evil, and that weed will have you nervous
But them bitches get you cute, and the pussy more potent
But I dont give a fuck, im stating callin hoes over
Mr. weedman meet me at my shows if you holdin'
A lot of niggas want it, and a lot of niggas chase it
But a lot of niggas die before they make
So while im getting money im gonna blow it like my papers
Where the fuck my bottles, where my mother fucking waitress, sorry darling are we clear?
Im standin' as a man till' im ruined
The worst thing you could do to me is shit I should be doing
And if a niggas fronting I take two and put it through him
Im no killer but I kill for what the fuck I am pursing. for real

[Hook]
Forever Reppin' When Im gone
I promise I'mma bring it back to home
And have my mother fucking weed broke down and my champagne popping
I can't forget the girls, all around the world
Reppin' for my city, putting on with my crew
And I'mma keep this money just to blow it with them too. Hey
