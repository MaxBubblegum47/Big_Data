[Philip Pevensie]

Forget the obligations
And get a little closer
Stop the alarms and see me wake up

I know that you've been with me all these days
I also know that we've only had sex

You say that maybe you want me
I guess you do not know how to lie

Love is a very exaggerated word
But maybe we can try
Love is a widely used word
For us it may be the first

I know it all starts like baby steps
This goes very fast I know


But we go


(Chorus)

Let's have a conversation
Maybe a little more action
But don't kill my vibes
Because I know how to shoot a man down
No no no try to kill my vibes
If you are enough, then do this

You may sound like my kryptonite
But I can take the risk
As long as you don't intend to hurt me
I can take the risk

[Big Sean]

I'm serious
I don't fuck with ya
I don't care if this is serious

Try to hurt me and you will see
As I will not be hard to beat

I'm serious
If you want to be part of my property
So enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself

No no no try to kill my vibes
If you are enough, then do this
So enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself

[Philip Pevensie]

(Chorus)

Let's have a conversation
Maybe a little more action
But don't kill my vibes
Because I know how to shoot a man down
No no no try to kill my vibes
If you are enough, then do this

You may sound like my kryptonite
But I can take the risk
As long as you don't intend to hurt me
I can take the risk

But don't kill my vibes
