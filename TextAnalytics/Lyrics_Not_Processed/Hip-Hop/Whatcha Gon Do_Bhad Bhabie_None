[Intro]
Woo
I got all the bands
Ay
24hrs
Woo

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Work
I pull up, she pull up her skirt
Drag her easy
I made me a milly, they didn't believe me
They don't wanna see me in the drop top
I just here lickin', bought a new pot
Stand in the kitchen, she twerk
I'm running round in reverse
Ooo, she think that I'm cool
No kissing and calling me boo
You lovin' that bitch but she lovin' the crew
Girl like "Damn, that's too many bands"
Right hot, might pull up in a drop top Lam

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Bands busted, bitch, bust it, whatcha gon' do?
Drippin', gushin', foreign is cussin', whatcha gon' do?
Everyday hustlin', bitch, you strugglin', whatcha gon' do?
Pockets puffin', ain't no reduction, whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? W-whatcha gon' do?
Bands busted, bitch, bust it, whatcha gon' do?
Drippin', gushin', foreign is cussin', whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? W-whatcha gon' do?

[Post-Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Whatcha gon' do?
(Ay)
Whatcha gon' do?

[Verse 2: 24hrs]
I put Gucci's on my feet

You know I really wanna dance
See all them diamonds on your hands
It's just a bikini
They see that we winning
Shout out my mama who made me
Shout out to God, he saved me
Rich the Kid, Bhad Bhabie
Bitches going crazy

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Bands busted, bitch, bust it, whatcha gon' do?
Drippin', gushin', foreign is cussin', whatcha gon' do?
Everyday hustlin', bitch, you strugglin', whatcha gon' do?
Pockets puffin', ain't no reduction, whatcha gon' do?
Whatcha gon' do? W-whatcha gon' do?
Bands busted, bitch, bust it, whatcha gon' do?
