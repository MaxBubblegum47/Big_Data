[Intro: Bernard Jabs]
Mic check, one, two, ayy, ayy
Mic check, one, two, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Bernard Jabs & 
iann dior
]
Me and shawty on the highway, going back to my place
Beamer in the driveway, park it in the driveway
Cuban like my chain
,
 going to a high stage
She gon' come to my place, do whatever I say
 (What, yeah)

[Chorus: iann dior, 
Bernard Jabs
 & Both]
Got a lil' shawty (
Got a lil' shawty
)
She off a molly, she in love with the drugs
Wanna fuck, when I'm done, kick her out, no time for fun
If you talking, show me what's up, got Lil Tecca with the drum
Now you quiet, how it's 'sposed to be, lil' nigga, you look dumb
What, yeah
I been in any bitch in my space
Why'd he got that shit? He gotta ship it back to cross-state
When I fuck lil' shawty, she can't ever stay at my place
I can't ever fuck 'cause I don't know what I'ma lose, ayy

[Verse 1: Bernard Jabs]
Aight, she be undercover, I can't let it show
Shawty love to trap and shit, she cook and sell the dope
If you ever got an issue, you can let me know
He said he got it coming through, I need 'bout three of those
I need 'bout three of those, I need 'bout three or more
Don't really need a bitch, ain't no problem to let her go
But if you fuck somebody else, you gotta let me know
I really want you to myself but got to let you go
Lemme know

[Pre-Chorus: Bernard Jabs & 
iann dior
]
Me and shawty on the highway, going back to my place (Back to my place)
Beamer in the driveway, park it in the driveway (In the driveway)
Cuban like my chain, going to a high stage
 (To a higher stage)
She gon' come to my place, do whatever I say
 (What, yeah)

[Chorus: iann dior, 
Bernard Jabs
 & Both]
Got a lil' shawty (
Got a lil' shawty
)
She off a molly, she in love with the drugs
Wanna fuck, when I'm done, kick her out, no time for fun
If you talking, show me what's up, got Lil Tecca with the drum
Now you quiet, how it's 'sposed to be, lil' nigga, you look dumb
What, yeah
I been in any bitch in my space
Why'd he got that shit? He gotta ship it back to cross-state
When I fuck lil' shawty, she can't ever stay at my place
I can't ever fuck 'cause I don't know what I'ma lose, ayy

[Verse 2: iann dior]
Won't lose
Tryna play the part but I won't let you though
Not heroic, I can't save these hoes, but damn, she flexible (Yeah)
So I bend her like a pretzel
Bend it over, touch your toes
Say my name real loud so your neighbors know I'm home (Let's go!)
That little bitch insane, coming 'round tryna pick my brain
But I can't let her though, she think she a clever ho
Now her boyfriend know, she turned to a lonely ho
All her friends know
Hit my line, we're next door

[Pre-Chorus: Bernard Jabs & 
iann dior
]
Me and shawty on the highway, going back to my place (
My place
)
Beamer in the driveway (
Yeah
), park it in the driveway (
Ooh
)
Cuban like my chain, going to a high stage
She gon' come to my place, do whatever I say
 (What, yeah)

[Chorus: iann dior, 
Bernard Jabs

Got a lil' shawty (
