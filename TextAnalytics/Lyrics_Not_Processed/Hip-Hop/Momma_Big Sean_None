[Intro: Fat Joe]
Woo
Pain
You hear the pain in my voice
We couldn't do it without you
Love you so much momma

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Die motherfucker die
That's what them niggas was yellin' out them Caddy sunroofs
While they lettin' loose
My momma there when a nigga was shot
I was pitchin' them rocks, had to live in them pots
My son autistic, my momma fightin' the cancer
Prayin' for answers, I'm out here taking them chances
Round the time my brother's the plug
Who'd of thought damn my nigga go blind from usin' drugs
It's 360 when them niggas hit me
Almost died in the hands of a coward like a scene out of 
Power
When Ton was killed all I had was my momma
Always bringin' the drama
Had to deal with the trauma
My momma

[Chorus: Dre]
My momma she the shit reason why I'm so legit
She the one that made a nigga like this
My momma my momma
She the one raised a hustler and a son
Every bag I get I gotta give her some
My momma my momma yeah
My momma my momma yeah
My

[Verse 2: 
Dre
]
I'm the one you can tell
Pray the Lord I never break
Give it all my everything
Put it on my everything
Any time I hit the ground you be by my side through everything
This is all I ever see every time I see your face
I love you
Yeah yeah
I love you
Yeah yeah
I love you
Yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look
I was born in a fire 
Product of Myra
Public school teacher English and writin'
Who taught me how to open my third eye up
The law of attraction, power of mind
And somehow provided when funds was all tied up
And still paid for all of my studio sessions
And even drove me there though
When I hit the booth I turned to a hero
Thanks to my dear old (mom)
When I got hit with them sexual assault charges on some fraud shit
On the news you and grandma saw it it broke my heart the hardest
And I almost lost all it friends stopped callin'
But you was in court right there with me bawlin' I cried too
You said the truth gon' come out
Next thing you know they dropped all the charges, real shit
You done see me bleed
You done see me black and blue on my knees
You done see my cry out dealin' with this hate and motivate me Wow
And now look what happened
Ain't no other nigga from the city that went back to back to back to back to back to back platinum (woah)
You my red carpet 
date
They ain't seen it like this since Donda and 'Ye
 (get it)
My momma got lead poisonin' so why the fuck you think she cares so much about girls and boys in Flint
She like they gotta go from boys to men from princess to queens
 And if they ain't being heard then you gotta be they voices then (you)
Ain't enough checks in the world to repay you
Only way is in the next lifetime I be one of your parents that save you
My momma

[Chorus: Dre]
My momma she the shit reason why I'm so legit
She the one that made a nigga like this
My momma my momma
She the one raised a hustler and a son
Every bag I get I gotta give her some
My momma my momma yeah
My momma my momma yeah
My
My momma she the shit reason why I'm so legit
She the one that made a nigga like this
My momma my momma
She the one raised a hustler and a son
Every bag I get I gotta give her some
My momma my momma yeah
My momma my momma

[Outro: Fat Joe]
Love you so much momma
