[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, I woke up with no one beside me
Reaching out for you like you were still there
Gave excuses like, "No labels, I'm not ready"
Now I'm drowning in a sea of regret, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not gonna say goodbye
'Cause I'm gonna change your mind
Let me love you, let me love you all day
I got a milli, got a million ways

I'm not gonna give you up
I got you, I swear to God
Let me love you, let me love you all day
I got a milli, got a milli, got a million ways

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Got a milli, got a milli, got a million
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Mmm, mmm)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Got a milli, got a milli, got a million
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Champagne sunset
Breakfast in bed
Away for the weekend, then do it again
When I'm out late thinkin' of ya
I'ma call ya, yeah
Show you I care that no one compares
When we get older, I wanna be there
Swim a mountain, climb an ocean
Do it for ya, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not gonna say goodbye (Oh, no)
'Cause I'm gonna change your mind
Let me love you, let me love you all day
I got a milli, got a million ways (A million ways)

I'm not gonna give you up
I got you, I swear to God (Oh, yeah)
Let me love you, let me love you all day
I got a milli, got a milli, got a million ways

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Got a milli, got a milli, got a million (Oh, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Mmm, mmm)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh)
Got a milli, got a milli, got a million (A million ways)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
How do I (How do I)
Do I show you how to make (How do I show you)
Make it right? (Make it right)
Instead of making more mistakes (Same mistakes)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not gonna say goodbye
Let me love you, let me love you all day
I got a milli, got a milli, got a million ways

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, no)
Got a milli, got a milli, got a million
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Let me love you alone
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Got a milli, got a milli, got a million (Oh, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Let me love you like that
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Got a milli, got a milli, got a million
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Got, got, got a million ways
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, got a milli, got a milli, got a million
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, yeah, oh
