[Verse 1]
You think by leaving me
The sun will go away
You think that if you go
There'll be no other way
But your leaving now
Won't even spoil my day

[Chorus]
Oh no no no
Oh no no no

[Verse 2]
You keep a-waiting for the tears
I'm supposed to cry
The promise leaves
So I'm supposed to die
I'd forgotten who you were
Until you dropped on by

[Chorus]
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no

[Verse 3]
You think I'm guilty throwing
Off the likes of you
That there'll be no one else
But there'll be quite a few
At least I've got my head
But somehow I'll pull through

[Chorus]
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no

[Outro]
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
