[Bridge: Bizzy Bone]
Welcome to my world
And you can see that we are more than thugs
And we more than warriors, more than guns
(More than warriors, more than guns)
Welcome to my world
And you can see that we are more than thugs
And we more than warriors, more than guns
(More than warriors, more than guns)

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
So none of y'all can see me 'cause I'm off too fast
I'ma show you niggas what you thought you had
Classic swag and I never been on none of that average rap
I don't dig it, I'd rather not hear it
The game is full of fakes and lames, and for the snakes I gain nothin' but hate and more pain
So I blow the other way and keep my focus clear, so sincere When I do it, I get into it, nobody does it better
Tougher than leather, fuckin' with me is like a never
Give me this track, I'll rip it in half, completely severed
So who I gotta step up to to show 'em that I'm fresher than you?
Now you know, that we know, you know, we much better than you
My crew we more than thugs
We warnin' ya, we warnin' ya

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone, 
Bizzy Bone

Roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up
(
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug

Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up
(
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
)
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up
(
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
)
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up
(
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
)
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Way beyond comparable and here's another parable
A group of young thugs from the streets with nowhere to go
We made it out the hood when it wasn't all good
Call it goin' for the gusto, armed with a deadly flow
They didn't figure that a nigga would pass the class
When the bell rang, I walked right passed the class
When the cell came, I banged and mashed for cash
So determined to have the last laugh
My dawgs above and beyond y'all
We attacked with rap and we sonned y'all
Gotta get it, I done been about my business so long with the Bone
Yeah, the Bone put it on y'all
Real niggas call it spade a spade
And since we made it great, we gettin' major pay
Catchin' major hate, holdin' major weight
'Til my dying day, we straight, we straight, we straight

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone, 
Bizzy Bone
 & 
Layzie Bone
]
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up
(
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
)
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up
(
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
)
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up
(
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
)
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up
(
Mo Thug, Mo Thug, Mo Thug
)
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone

Roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up
Smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up
And I smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
And I smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
(Smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up)
Roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up
Smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone

Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
