[Verse 1]
You're so rich, bet you bought yourself a diamond chain
To look real cool while you're telling all your friends it's fake
But you know it's lies
Another bitch from the Upper West Side
Credit cards cutting all of your lines, yeah

[Verse 2]
You're so cute, bet you really wanna be a star
To feel like gold when you're dancing on broken hearts
And you know it's true
You're no good 'til they're looking at you
Bad front, I can see right through, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stop judging every thing you do
But I can't get enough of you

[Chorus]
Ooh, oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-ooh

[Verse 3]
I sleep great knowing we will never be the same
'Cause I'm downtown hanging out while you're in a plane
And I'm doing fine
Even though you're still on my mind
Train rides to the Upper West Side, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stop judging every thing you do
But I can't get enough of you

[Chorus]
Ooh, oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-ooh

[Bridge]
I can't stop
I can't get enough of you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stop judging every thing you do
But I can't get enough of you

[Chorus]
Ooh, oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-ooh
