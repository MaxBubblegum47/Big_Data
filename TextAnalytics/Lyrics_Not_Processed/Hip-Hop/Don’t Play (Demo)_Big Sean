[Intro: Matthew Healy]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and from, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas (Straight up)
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playing with these niggas (Straight up)
I ain't playin' with these niggas (Oh no)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas (Oh no, La Flame)
I ain't playin' with these niggas (Straight up, straight up)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Know I need my dollars
Know a nigga need my commas (Straight up)
She was down when I dropped out of college
Down, she was down when I rode Impalas (LaFlame)
Played with her pussy in the Jeep
Yeah, she was down with the foreplay drivin' (Oh no)
Jumped in the car when she hit my digits
Don't want nothin', just to pull up at the projects (Skrt!)
Easy to me my nigga
Villa with a scene, youngin' always seen with a killer (Straight up)
Hand-stitched by my dealer
Dealing with a seam you ain't seen, what you mean Margiela? (Flame)
She even got the 'scripts for the cough
In the H gotta hit Johnny for the frost, swerved off
Ain't it been a minute since they seen a weird nigga
From the corner put it on for the south? (Straight up)
On my momma, know a nigga be coasting
Go, nigga, go nigga grab my bottles
Go, nigga, go nigga grab my chronic (Let go)
Keep ya head up in the air my nigga
Niggas gon' be billionaires my nigga (Straight up)
Fuck how much time that shit might take
Niggas ain't playin' with 'em

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas (Straight up)
I ain't playin' with these niggas (La Flame)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playing with these niggas (Oh no)
I ain't playin' with these niggas (Oh no)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas

[Bridge: Matthew Healy]
Tabs with unlimited O's, new clothes, bloody nose
Powders and walking back home
Has he got enough weed? No, broken phone
Retching on the floor alone
I can't believe that we're talking about him

[Verse 2: Matthew Healy]
I'm searching you mate, your jaw's all over the place
Can't talk, quick slap in the face
Yes I threw a nut, but your friends a case
Why you singling him out, is it because of his race?
Look, the dog won't bark if you don't lark about
Has he got enough weed? No
Broken phone, retching on the floor alone
I can't believe that we're talking about him
I'm searching you mate, your jaw's all over the place
Can't talk, quick slap in the face
Yes I threw a nut, but your friends a case
Why you singling him out, is it because of his race?
Look, the dog won't bark if you don't lark about (Huh)

[Outro: A$AP Bari]
These niggas ain't lords
We the new Lords
We the new Lords
We the new Lords
