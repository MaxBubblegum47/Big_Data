As we ride by the end of the night
You will envision how thugstas play
Can you handle the vibe?
Pedal to the medal we see blue light

Fin to get that gangster getting a demon you can conjure up and see
If we get angels pinnin my ankles bloody murder fuck with Jesus
He done creeping deep puttin' those to sleep till I raise up on my enemies
Let's get pumped for the peeps in Egypt and 400 years of oppression
Spread the message I ain't finished, diminished you so called critics
And fuck them billboard and the billboard status me kick it
You fucked up for a while for the day that I was in trial
Man and I don't know how style through with them crowds and now

Remember the sound of the rounds came from my town
I know you bitch would bite that we can't allow
Anyone claim my style, I'm ready to beat you down
Hittin' them tombstones (sellin volumes) gettin' them costumes bow now
I'm rolling with Makaveli pinnin' my pistol steady ready
Buck them flames aim for the pressure point

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I beg your pardon my nigga but how do you know me

Should've put him in his coffin now 'cause he'd a been found, pow pow
Put him in the river now nigga who wild wild
What incredible style that's what you was thinkin
When you tried to get it down
We see that you fuck with a daily crowd so nigga just turn your ass out
Whenever you ready to rumble my nigga just meet us outside of the club
Ready to slang slugs nigga done got to drunk and forgot that we claim thug
Nigga this shit is ridiculous
Just dismiss the thought that you could get rid of us
Buck you to hell it was nigga you down with us
Nigga you scared when a St. Clair nigga bust
Aw fuck left his guts in my trunk nigga tried a 211 fucked around got 187
Niggas with heat who could it be nobody but them T-H-U-G's with artillery
We come in peace nigga please freeze
Put 'em on they knees nigga don't even breathe and these
Are the warriors killers destroyin' ya you're gonna die
