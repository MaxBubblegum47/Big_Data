[Verse 1: Krayzie]
Nigga wuz born and brought up in Cleveland
Cool quiet just like my daddy
When I wuz thuggin out in the alley
With my boys in a stolen Caddie
I wuz shootin the breeze blowin some weed
And every now and then I sip some Hennesey
And after my niggas wuz bustin we probably wuz lookin for trouble
Uh Oh here come the po po
Yall better toss that llello quick and tuck ya bankroll
Don't think I forgot where I come from dog cuz I know
Cleveland Ohio fo sho where we slang dope in the snow

[Verse 2: Wish]
I'm from the streets the streets of Cleveland
Its manditory you need it cuz niggas'll catch ya slippin
And niggas'll leave ya bleedin
Fuck what they said about Bone catch us anywhere
Grab a couple of my St. Claire niggas take us anywhere
We don't care
Handle that and take care of that
If it goes like that then it goes like that
It's Cleveland [Cleveland]
Its manditory to leave these niggas bleedin [bleedin]
And you could neva hate against Bone you wrong
U know we brung it on so strong

[Verse 3: Layzie]
We get em, split em, we hit em
And Bone been the shit since I could remember
Befo most of these niggas even thought about rap
We wuz screamin out no surrender
With a gat in the hand runnin wild in the land
With a pocket full of boulders
Po po know they can't hold us
When they east dog comin from the shoulders
And the older niggas they told us
U gotta get down fo yo hustle
Got Glocks to show you this muscle
Get the money little nigga don't struggle
That's no bitch nigga that's the rules
All my Cleveland niggas said to me
For the ones that gave this game to me
I'ma push this shit from A to Z

[Verse 4: Bizzy]
Ya better believe Syann I be scared when I wuz there
Nigga you know I ain't goin nowhere

In the Columbus but they loved me not
When I went to Cleveland they said where you been
When I'm unconditional with my loving
