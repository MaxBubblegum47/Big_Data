[Verse 1]
I know you was mine a couple of times
A couple of nights ago
Sat on the couch, you're telling me why
How I shouldn't let you go
Why, why, why did I stay like this?
Why, why didn't I quit?
I know that you know that I'm gonna go
That I'm one foot out the door
Not innocent, you're tryna prevent
And pray that I'm moving slow
Why, why, why did I stay like this?
I must admit

[Chorus]
Loving you was easy
Watching us on TV, breaking news
I think that I'm better, better, better without you
Don't you think I'm better, better, better without you?
Loving you was so sweet
Now watch us on the TV, falling through
I think that I'm better, better, better without you
Don't you think I'm better, better, better without you?

[Verse 2]
Now that I've had a couple of weeks
A couple of sleeps, I know
You're not the man my mama should meet
The one I'll be taking home
Though I know I'm not that into this
I must admit

[Chorus]
Loving you was easy
Watching us on TV, breaking news
I think that I'm better, better, better without you
Don't you think I'm better, better, better without you?
Loving you was so sweet
Now watch us on the TV, falling through
I think that I'm better, better, better without you
Don't you think I'm better, better, better without you?

[Bridge]
'Cause loving you was easy
Loving you was easy
I know that I'm better
(On the TV, breaking news)
(I think that I'm better without you)
I know that I'm better without you
(I think that I'm better without you)
On the TV, breaking news
I think that I'm better without you
(I think that I'm better without you)
On the TV, breaking news
I think that I'm better without you
Aah

[Chorus]
'Cause loving you was easy
Watching us on TV, breaking news
I think that I'm better, better, better without you
Don't you think I'm better, better, better without you?
Loving you was so sweet
Now watch us on the TV, falling through
I think that I'm better, better, better without you
Don't you think I'm better, better, better without you?

[Outro]
On the TV, breaking news
I think that I'm better without you
I think that I'm better without you, don't you?
Watch us on the TV, breaking news
I think that I'm better without you
I think that I'm better without you, don't you?
Watch us on the TV, breaking news
I think that I'm better without you
I think that I'm better without you, don't you?
