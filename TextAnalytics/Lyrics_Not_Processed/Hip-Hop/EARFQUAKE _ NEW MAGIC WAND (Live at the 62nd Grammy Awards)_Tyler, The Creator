[Part 1: EARFQUAKE]

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Boyz II Men]
You make my earth quake (Ooh)
Oh, you make my earth quake
Riding around, your love be—, me up
And making my heart—
Oh, you make my earth quake
Oh, you make my earth quake (Earth quake)
Riding around, your love be shakin' me up
You're making my heart break (Break)

[Refrain: Charlie Wilson & Boyz II Men]
So don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault
And it all comes crashing down, I'll need you

[Part 2: NEW MAGIC WAND]

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New—
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, whoop!

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture, uh
She's really messin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand (Ay)
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Wand, ah)
New magic (Whoop!), new magic, new magic wand

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin', baby
This 60-40 isn't workin', uh
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)
You wanna be mean, boy, whoo! (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, yeah, I just got a magic wand, uh (Don't leave)
We can finally be together, together, together, baby, uh

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Boys II Men]

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you will not be here
I will not fetch the ball
My eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
But it has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned, that's new magic wand
