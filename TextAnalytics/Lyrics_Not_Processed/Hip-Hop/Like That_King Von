[Intro: Lil Durk]
A nigga talkin' 'bout a motherfucker can't use no tune
Like a motherfucker ain't in these streets, on God

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Why you playin' with my shorty like he won't come up out that cut?
Why you talkin' out your neck like he won't turn your ass to Runtz?
They say why we ain't kill his ass? We was on his ass for a couple months
You know Blow, his ass a smoker, he put three grams in a blunt
Got a booster, she'll do it, I don't pay for Saint Laurent
Ain't no peace treaty with the opps, don't call my phone 'cause I ain't the one
How they give him 39 and he ain't get caught up with no gun?
Ain't no pass, we on your ass, don't get caught up with your son
It's one opp that we ain't blast, after him, it ain't no fun
How you say your ass the man and you ain't give your block no guns?
Man, you know his ass a rat, how he get out in a month?
Why you actin' like a bitch? Nigga, you should've been a punk
We gon' catch you lackin', off them pills, wearin' them glasses
We gon' hit your blindside, foenem hit you nine times
I send hits through Cash App, I'm on the 6 with Badazz
On that car if he back back, fuck my opps, I'm Die Y

[Chorus: King Von & 
Lil Durk

Who got the pills in there? (

Take off your heels in here (
Take off your heels in here
)
It's gon' get real in here (
On God
)
So don't get killed in here (
Let's get it
)

[Verse 2: King Von]
I got my pipe in here, I won't think twice in here
I'm shootin' everybody, even the...
OT, I fly you here, what size shoe you wear?
Must be the pills talkin', can't lie, I'm high as hell
Where I'm from, you better not tell
, 
where I'm from, it's dead or jail
Where I'm from, it's on that car, and watch out, there go 12
Where I'm from, it's hit or miss, and he got hit, he quit
Where I'm from, you lookin' stiff, then put him in a zip
Where I'm from, we smokin' him, that Tooka, man, be chokin' him
These hoes ain't shit, gang, I'm fuckin' her, she posting him
She made a paragraph, she talkin' 'bout she was close to him
Hoes ain't shit, her baby daddy, she killed both of them
