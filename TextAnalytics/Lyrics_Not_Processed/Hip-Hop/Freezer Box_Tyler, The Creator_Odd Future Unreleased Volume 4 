[Verse 1: Skoolie 300]
Swerving in that motherfucking Contour
Bitches at the concert want a fucking encore
So I tell her meet me in the back by the [?]
Fuck her in the concourse, listening to "Yonkers"
Tell her to take her clothes off, I really want to fuck her
Want to beep beep, yeah nigga when I honk her
Told her talk slow but go a little longer
She hits me once got damn, she a goner
Nigga you're a loner
Should've never came around a nigga when a nigga had a boner
Now she wanna roll a nigga weed, she a stoner
Wish I met her first but I wish I didn't know her
All on my back, just chilling on my shoulders
Just a young nigga, she like twelve years older
Believe every single damn lie that I told her
This shit is kind of weird and this shit is kind of crazy
But fuck you, pay me

[Hook (4x): Skoolie 300]
I'm fucking cold
I'm fucking ice

[Verse 2: Skoolie 300 & 
Jack Mushroom
]
Ice, ice, baby
Hating ass niggas want the best of me
Cause they find out that I don't referee
They want that cook crack flow, I'm the recipe
Yo Jack! 
 Nigga don't mess with me
Fuck it, you fat bitch you look like a whale
Light skin, my ass, nigga you're pale
Pancake on [?] nigga in jail
It ain't never coming back
Oh shit, oh well
What a bad mistake this my nigga pancake
When I slap you in the fucking face
Hog tie you with matching tape
Sit you in the front of a Prius
With your feet up and a secret place to mate and watch
As I [?] nigga

[Hook (4x): Skoolie 300]
I'm fucking cold
I'm fucking ice

[Outro]
Goddamn motherfucker look
Hey, goddamn motherfucker look
Hey, goddamn...
Hahahaha
