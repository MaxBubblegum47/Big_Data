[Intro]
Ayy, yeah, ayy, yeah
You know, I want a motherfuckin'
A motherfuckin' astronaut chain
With a Gatorade on that bitch

[Chorus]
White coupe, butter pecan
Thick bitch, Puerto Rican
Take you out to Paraguay
Or California for the weekend
I'm with Sak and Juvy
So you gotta bring about three friends
Don't flex, don't pretend
You know we spin a bend

[Verse 1]
Fifty thousand dollar advance in my account, huh
Runnin' up them bands with my mans and that's how we
Gotta get these racks 'cause I can and we
YNW's a family
I might just cop a Rolex or Cuban link
I been going through some things
I wanted you to see if
You could maintain this lifestyle that I live
'Cause I am you and you are me 'til the very end
I just want a Cuban link
Wash away all of the pain
Mixin' molly with the apple juice
I don't do that no more, who the hell are you?
Smokin' on that Cranberry Kush weed
Wash away all of the pain
Mixin' molly with the apple juice
I don't do that no more, who the hell are you?

[Chorus]
White coupe, butter pecan
Thick bitch, Puerto Rican
Take you out to Paraguay
Or California for the weekend
I'm with Sak and Juvy
So you gotta bring about three friends
Don't flex, don't pretend
You know we spin a bend
White coupe, butter pecan
Thick bitch, Puerto Rican
Take you out to Paraguay
Or California for the weekend
I'm with Sak and Juvy
So you gotta bring about three friends
Don't flex, don't pretend
You know we spin a bend

[Verse 2]
I wanna get head from every girl (Every girl)
She already know it's a Young Nigga World (Mwah)
Get you a fleece with the fur and some extra pearls
Put twenty racks in your pocket
Just in case you need it, I got you (I got you)
We taking off like a rocket (Rocket)
When she say that I'm Mandy, like Billy and Mandy
But bitch, I'm the Reaper, she ain't a keeper
I'm creeping in a Jeep but I am not Jeepers Creepers, and yes I
You got finessed for your shit and you know that Young Nigga World did it the right
You got finessed for your shit and you know that Young Nigga World did it the right
You got finessed out your shit and you know that Young Nigga World did it the right way

[Chorus]
White coupe, butter pecan
Thick bitch, Puerto Rican
Take you out to Paraguay
Or California for the weekend
I'm with Sak and Juvy
So you gotta bring about three friends
Don't flex, don't pretend
You know we spin a bend
White coupe, butter pecan
Thick bitch, Puerto Rican
Take you out to Paraguay
Or California for the weekend
I'm with Sak and Juvy
So you gotta bring about three friends
Don't flex, don't pretend
You know we spin a bend
