[Verse 1]
You could shake the stars
Out of the sky
It doesn't matter
Our fate's will collide
You can pull the plug out
Watch all the water strain
Still I know it would be the same
Still I know
It would be the same

[Pre-Chorus]
I see it in my mind's eye
A world made just for you and I
So I know
It's worth the wait

[Chorus]
Oh
Once is enough
That's how I feel
We do this once and for real
Love
Is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and
For real

[Verse 2]
I'm building my life
To include you
So for now I have someone
To look forward to
I'm in no hurry, no worries you're out there somewhere
Still I hope that you will be here soon
Still I hope
That you would be here soon

[Pre-Chorus]
I see it in my mind's eye
A world made just for you and I
So I know
It's worth the wait

[Chorus]
Oh
Once is enough
That's how I feel
We do this once and for real
Love
Is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and
For real

[Bridge]
Oh oh (I'm waiting for something)
Oh oh (I'm waiting for something)
Oh oh (I'm waiting for you)
Yeah

[Chorus]
Oh
Once is enough
That's how I feel
We do this once and for real
Love
Is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and
For real
Oh
Once is enough
That's how I feel
We do this once and for real
Love
Is strong enough
So here's the deal
We do this once and
For real
