[Verse 1]
Yo bitch on me but you can never do nothing
'Cause yo' mama raised a pussy
Every time I walk to the drop top, can't help but
Close my eyes 'cause my whip so glossy
God damn, bitch, I don't smoke no gas
I don't pop no Xans, hella cake
I just need that ass, don't worry 'bout no mans
Look at me, look at he, you don't wanna fuck with we
Hit the streets, roll on me, you gon' end up in the sea

[Bridge 1]
7:30, wake up, skrt up in the lobby then proceed to flee
All my people ridin' in the backseat on a killin' spree
Wait, who that be, ready on the count of 3
Squeeze the G, leave the scene
Bouncin' like the trampoline

[Chorus]
Gettin' bread, earn income (Man)
Spent it on this Balmain
Working all night I might run into the Batman
I don't see no such thing as a mothe'fuckin' bro, mane
You ain't fuckin' slick if you think you in my team, mane

[Verse 2]
We gon' pull up on the kids with a flat brim cap and the tats get the  brick
And I don't give a fuck, hit em with the damn dicks
Man, hold up, pause, now they red like Santa Claus
I'm a G bet there's something wrong with me
All these mans on the ground, lookin like the dead ass sea
Yeah, pull up on me, sip a high-t, 'til I OD
I don't really give a fuck no more, B
Skrrt skrrt onamonapee, bitch Grand Prix
Pull up on a fuckin enemy, third degree
Now I'ma go right back to the crib (To the crib bitch)
And leave the fuckin country with the brick (Loudpack)

[Bridge 2]
I'd call the cops on myself if I can (If I can)
This shit too crazy, need the fuckin ambulance (Ambulance)
Don't wear no jackets, I just wear that metal vest (Skrrt skrrt)
Got all this money but these bitches unimpressed (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Getting bread, earn income (Man)
Spend it on this Balmain
Working all night I might run into the Bat (Man)
I don't see no such thing as a motherfucking bro mane
You ain't fucking slick if you think you in my team, mane

[Bridge 1]
7:30 wake up skrt up in the lobby then proceed to flee
All my people riding in the back seat on a killing spree
Wait, who that be? Ready on the count of 3
Squeeze the G, leave the scene
Bouncin' like the trampoline
Yeah
