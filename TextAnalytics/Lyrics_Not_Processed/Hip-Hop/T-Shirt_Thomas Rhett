[Verse 1]
Get off work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parking lot
It was two for one and four for two
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up like I was on you

[Pre-Chorus]
I said hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over
You say, "No way" then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were wearing my

[Chorus]
T-shirt, right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my T-shirt
Yeah, you look good in my t-shirt, girl
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
We were walking up the stairs
With the neighbors saying "Keep it down"
But it's hard to unlock the door
When you're making out (You know what I'm sayin'?)
You've been saying that we've gotta quit doin' this
So why you leanin' in for one more kiss
And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
And slippin' into my

[Chorus]
T-shirt, right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
In my t-shirt

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
Cause you sure look good in my t-shirt
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
You look good on my mind

[Bridge]
I said, "Hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over?"
You say, "No way" then you move in closer
Next thing I know, you were wearing my t-shirt
Mmm, you look just so dang hot in my t-shirt
I see you spinning around in my t-shirt
Right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot

[Chorus]
My t-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh, so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
You look good in my t-shirt, baby
Yeah
(You think you're gonna look good in my t-shirt)
You look good in my t-shirt
Yeah, I think you look good in my t-shirt, uh
(You think you're gonna look good in my t-shirt)
Oh, you look so good in my t-shirt
(You think you're gonna look good in my t-shirt)
