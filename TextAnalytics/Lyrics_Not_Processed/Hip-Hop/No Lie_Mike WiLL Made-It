[Intro: 2 Chainz]
EarDrummers, Mike WiLL Made-It
Yah! T.R.U., 2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smokin' on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s? Not I, I smoke strong; that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that bla-kow, dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas, don't try me, I'll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do, nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die, whattup?

[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and Champagne, you want true? That’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food, she got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out and I say, "Damn, that makes two of us"
Aww, that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full so I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back, we don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some, I’ll out-rap his ass, out-trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass, take him out
Bring 'em in, them whole things, 2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn’t, went where they say I couldn’t (Tru!)
YSL belt buckle, y’all niggas sure is lookin'
Y’all niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do, nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die, whattup?

[Outro: 2 Chainz]
Word, word, T.R.U
