[Intro]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna—
Jetson made another one, baby

[Chorus]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, "I don't wanna move too fast"
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast

[Verse 1]
She said, "Jack, where you been at?"
On the road, but I just got back
And I'm still flyer than a bitch
And ya boyfriend, well he just not that
And I, I don't know how to behave
I'ma tell her be safe
I don't need the pussy, I'ma tell her be safe
I got God with me and he's telling me things

[Chorus]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, "I don't wanna move too fast"
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I'm just tryna' see something
I ain't gotta say it 'cause they know where we from
I got some money out the ATM, but I'm gonna keep some
Strip club, pre-cum off of the liquor, fell in love with a stripper
Now I'm asking her where she from
As if we gon' be something
I wanna be something
Take my number down, you can hit me if you need some'
Said she got three sons
Do you want four? 'Cause I need one
Do you got whores? 'Cause I'll be one
Going all night like the reruns

[Chorus]
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
Baby, can you do it like that?
From the front to the back
She said, "I don't wanna move too fast"
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast
