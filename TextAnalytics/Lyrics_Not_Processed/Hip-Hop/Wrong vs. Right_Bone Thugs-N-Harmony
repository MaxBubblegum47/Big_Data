"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
Look, nigga—from the cradle to the grave, you gotta hustle to get paid
I'm so thuggish in my ways, I usually go hard for days
I ain't gon' slow down, I speed up and mash on your section
Ain't no time to kick your feet up, I'm past the agression
They taught me, world is like a pussy—nigga, play and get fucked
I'm out here mindin' my own bidness, niggas pressin' their luck
And I'm like stuck in the middle of a rock and a hard place
Makin' my money rappin' and I won't stop till the song lays
Movin' by the lord's grace, tryna win the long race
End up in the wrong place on any given day, nigga

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone +

It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"
It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"
It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"
It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
My rent ain't paid
My shit ain't straight, I'm ready to flip
I'm goin' insane because my kids ain't ate, they lookin' at Daddy, askin'
Why ain't no food on they plate, tryna have faith
But I don't know how much more I can take before I risk it all
Forget the law, get in my car, head to
The local liquor store, now stick 'em up—fuck all
Ya'll, somebody gotta explain to me
How I'm workin' a nine-to-five and still can't get the things we need
My anger leads to me pullin' a double-
Barrel-barrel shotgun—bitch, give everything to me

It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder

It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"
It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"
It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
Hit 'em hard and leave—Momma who you can see
Fuck the law, niggas draw, yeah, but who gon' bleed?
In the middle of this funk-beat shit in the trunk
I provide it, but if you really want—let's get jump
Granny says, "Slow it down 'cause you really got somethin'
And you need to stick around"
But I hustle, 'cause they got dough and my mind's blown
I'm a stick-up kid, better watch in you rearview
'Cause they got issues, fuck around and they will miss you
Hurtin' up but fuckin' up—lucky if I miss you

It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"
It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder
"Something that can make you do wrong—make you do right"
