[Chorus]
Chopper so big, it'll knock down a wall
I take her home and I knock down her walls
'Fore a nigga walked, I had to crawl
I know how it feel to lose it all
That's why I ain't tryna lose it all
We'll take them straps and shoot at y'all
Swiping and drugs, I did it all
Swiping and drugs, I did it all
How can you live with yourself if you not loyal?
I put my freedom at risk for it
I had to break down a brick for it
I had to pull out a stick for it
Baby girl, come and fuck a don
I got her wet like a pond
He not a king, he a pawn
I got that green like a lawn
I got that green like a yard
He not a G, he commitin' fraud
Identify theft, that nigga, he a fraud
She looked at me and said that she loyal
I looked at her and said, "You might get spoiled"
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 1]
No, he not loyal, that nigga fake
Yeah, he a motherfuckin' snake
Shoot him in the motherfuckin' face
You need to pump your goddamn brakes
'Fore I leave you in a neck brace
Chop up a brick, but I don't know karate
I get that check, I don't hate on nobody
I take my hands and I feel on her body
Just blew a check when I went up to Follies
I'm in the trap every night
Ran up a bag and I got me some might
Run up a bag and I flew out to Denver
I know them plants ready in September
Sticks everywhere like we cut down some timber
Bitch, I'm a G, I go knock off a killer, yeah
I had to swipe a lil' bit
I ruined my life for this shit
I paid the price for this shit
Sold a lil' white for this shit
How can you live with yourself if you fake?
If you not loyal, then you a disgrace
I started growing and made somethin' shake
Bag up a bale and I sweep up the shake

[Chorus]
Chopper so big, it'll knock down a wall
I take her home and I knock down her walls
'Fore a nigga walked, I had to crawl
I know how it feel to lose it all
That's why I ain't tryna lose it all
We'll take them straps and shoot at y'all
Swiping and drugs, I did it all
Swiping and drugs, I did it all
How can you live with yourself if you not loyal?
I put my freedom at risk for it
I had to break down a brick for it
I had to pull out a stick for it
Baby girl, come and fuck a don
I got her wet like a pond
He not a king, he a pawn
I got that green like a lawn
I got that green like a yard
He not a G, he commitin' fraud
Identify theft, that nigga, he a fraud
She looked at me and said that she loyal
I looked at her and said, "You might get spoiled"
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 2]
Pop me a Xan' and reminisce
Lord knows I been through some shit
Lord knows I had to do some shit
I went to Cali and found a plug
Bought a hundred, then made it flood
Pop a seal, then sip some mud
I got this shit out the mud for real
I did this shit without a deal
Ain't have a OG for real for real
But I got OG for real for real
Stood in the trap and made a quarter mil'
I'm sippin' Actavis out the pint
I'm tryna ball for the rest of my life
Could've been dead, I know how to maneuver
We got a check, but we came from the sewer
I'm smoking loud while my girl smokin' hookah
Yeah, I'm a boss, but I ride with the shooters
I pick up that Draco and aim it and shoot it
If he disloyal, we gotta remove him
I had to work for it, so I'ma cherish it
These niggas so fake, I swear it's so embarrassing
I don't conceal it, I show it and carry it

[Chorus]
Chopper so big, it'll knock down a wall
I take her home and I knock down her walls
'Fore a nigga walked, I had to crawl
I know how it feel to lose it all
That's why I ain't tryna lose it all
We'll take them straps and shoot at y'all
Swiping and drugs, I did it all
Swiping and drugs, I did it all
How can you live with yourself if you not loyal?
I put my freedom at risk for it
I had to break down a brick for it
I had to pull out a stick for it
Baby girl, come and fuck a don
I got her wet like a pond
He not a king, he a pawn
I got that green like a lawn
I got that green like a yard
He not a G, he commitin' fraud
Identify theft, that nigga, he a fraud
She looked at me and said that she loyal
I looked at her and said, "You might get spoiled"
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
