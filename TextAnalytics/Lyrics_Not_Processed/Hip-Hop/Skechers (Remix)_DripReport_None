[Intro: DripReport]
I tried to stop, but I can't stop
I just can't stop thinking about her
I don't know, all I remember was she wear the Skechers
The light-up ones

[Chorus: DripReport & Tyga]
Shawty bad with the Skechers on
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl
Light-up, light-up Skechers
Light up, light up my world
Shawty bad with the Skechers on
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl
Light-up, light-up Skechers (Hah)
Light up, light up my world (Woo)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ayy, shawty bad with the Skechers on
Walking in the bank like: 'Honey, I'm home'
We tryna quarantine, she won't leave me alone
I got Yeezys, you got them Sketchers on (Haha)
Kicks like a hypebeast, but I don't wait in line
You got the moves when you move, when you whine
You can call me up, let it ring one time (Brrt)
1-800-Big-Vibe bling my hotline (Brrt)
I don't want to share you
Only want to wear you
Ooh, I think I like you
Skate and slide beside you (B-i-b-l-e)
I ball like Kyle Kuzma, I'm runnin' it up
She a stallion like Meg when she liftin' it up
Can I get two of you for the price of one?

[Chorus: DripReport and Tyga]
Shawty bad with the Skechers on
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl
Light-up, light-up Skechers (Light it up)
Light up, light up my world (Light it up)
Shawty bad with the Skechers on (Shawty bad)
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl (My girl)
Light-up, light-up Skechers (Light it up)
Light up, light up my world (Light it up)

[Verse 2: DripReport]
I like your Skechers, you like me, my Gucci shoes
I'll buy you the purse, only if you show me your boobs
I like your Skechers, you like me too
Bring your friends, all of us in the pool
Bad lil' bitch, all my drip make her drool
Brand new whip, come and sit in the coupe
I just wanna make you mine, hop inside the ride
Nina by my side, promise you it all be fine
I-I just wanna make you mine, hop inside the ride
Nina by my side, promise it's gon' be alright

[Chorus: DripReport]
Shawty bad with the Skechers on
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl
Light-up, light-up Skechers
Light up, light up my world
Shawty bad with the Skechers on
Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl
Light-up, light-up Skechers
Light up, light up my world
