[Chorus: Big B & Bizzy Bone]
I was born in the Ghetto, raised in the Ghetto
Ain't nobody takin' that from me (Born in the Ghetto)
This time it's gonna get better, get better with this chedda
I need someone who'll do this [?] (Born in the Ghetto)

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
The Ghetto would always gon' hold me down
Pickin' me up when I'm flat on the ground
Liftin' me up through the dirt that I found
Takin' me well beyond leaps and bounds
Sold to the [?], souls of the clown
Little window out in the park
It don't get no better when I get it in
Got any Henny for my kinfolk, some Indo
Dead in my tracks like Kimbo, slam back another six-four
Sip slow, got lifted, out on my mind, flippin', I'm fine
Back to that ghetto smhetto
Back to the basics, back to the missions
My niggas, no kiddin', I get on this plane and I'm goin' insane and I'm sharin' my rhythm
Been working on second winds
I'm second to none, seconds to win, seconds to run
First to lose it, worst to come
Sippin' on booze, forever young
That's real talk, come at you young
You can hear my real heart, it's real dark back where I'm from
That's cause they'll kill ya
Mamma told me get money, boy, don't be no dummy but she was so caught up I thought I was nothing
I'm probably something, [?] method is complex
It's ghetto, I'm ghetto
Fuck it, what, I'm ghetto
Buckets, what
Shawty know how to party
Little ghetto in all of us

[Chorus: Big B & Bizzy Bone]
I was born in the Ghetto, raised in the Ghetto
Ain't nobody takin' that from me (Born in the Ghetto)
This time it's gonna get better, get better with this chedda
I need someone who'll do this [?] (Born in the Ghetto)
I was born in the Ghetto, raised in the Ghetto
Ain't nobody takin' that from me (Born in the Ghetto)
This time it's gonna get better, get better with this chedda
I need someone who'll do this [?] (Born in the Ghetto)

[Verse 2: Flesh-n-Bone]
I was conceived in the back seat of my Grand daddy's Caddy
Momma had me, she was 17 and my Pappy was a Marine
Big dreams livin' in the ghetto, brick cities, seven levels
Roses don't grow through concrete, streets loaded with heavy metal
Chase paper or chase the devil
We can dance up under the moonlight
We can all fight, fuck it, bars and stripes, red blue and white
Listen at the shit I say, 'bout to sway as I convey
Everyday it's payday no they ain't fuck around
My thugs persuade
These niggas you see me wit' bitch
We got way more to lose
They call me Sticky, got an itchy trigger finger niggas hog all your booze up
We can kick it like trues, man, get it in
Wit' a known motherfucker how to win
This is a trend, we said it again and again, I guess I'm going to win
I keep plenty of guns on deck, it's plenty niggas that's from my set
Sign a motherfucker's check you can't even cash, well, that's your ass fool
Bet, I'ma let it rest
7/11 I'm breaking the bank
Makin' it out the Ghetto I'm livin' swell now-swell now

[Chorus: Big B & Bizzy Bone]
I was born in the Ghetto, raised in the Ghetto
Ain't nobody takin' that from me (Born in the Ghetto)
This time it's gonna get better, get better with this chedda
I need someone who'll do this [?] (Born in the Ghetto)
I was born in the Ghetto, raised in the Ghetto
Ain't nobody takin' that from me (Born in the Ghetto)
This time it's gonna get better, get better with this chedda
I need someone who'll do this [?] (Born in the Ghetto)

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
I was born with a strike against me
Then they told me that life was empty
I don't like it but the fight is in me
Never ever would I give 'em my rights, don't tempt me
Move forward, tunnel vision
I channel my energy without a collision
They feelin' the synergy, all the decisions I'm makin' broadcasts like a television
It's all in the ether
It's either I make it or somebody dead
Cause I'm tired, I'm humble, no pride
I'm ready to ride, rebellin' 'cause Satan a lie
I'ma sit back, exhibit some patience for the Lord, no limits, no waitin'
All the boys, single women, and babies depart from the ghetto with Layzie
Too long we been dealin' wit' the stress and the pressure of workin' with lesser and less
I knew momma would struggle and no one would help her
The drama was too much to measure
Pleasure only came when we could make her smile
Treasure every day, I could make her proud
Better one day, wait, how 'bout now?
Together we pray, all out loud
I'm down, I'm not out
I found a way to get out
Said I couldn't do it put my mind to it
Look Stuart, we found a way out
Tryna come up, not to stay out
Really to bring back the love for the kids
Like look what I did, you can do this
You always can make it wherever you live

[Chorus: Big B & Bizzy Bone]
I was born in the Ghetto, raised in the Ghetto
Ain't nobody takin' that from me (Born in the Ghetto)
This time it's gonna get better, get better with this chedda
I need someone who'll do this [?] (Born in the Ghetto)
I was born in the Ghetto, raised in the Ghetto
Ain't nobody takin' that from me (Born in the Ghetto)
This time it's gonna get better, get better with this chedda
I need someone who'll do this [?] (Born in the Ghetto)
