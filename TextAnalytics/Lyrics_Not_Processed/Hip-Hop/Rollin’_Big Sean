Ass shake, ass shake
Yeah, I like that ass shake
Y'all bitches gon' show me love
I know ya'll hoes ain't that fake
A real G, believe that
Feelin' like Outkast
I'm already big, now I'm finna be on 3 stacks
She on that superman, blue and red cop car
Can't sing a lick, now she finna be a pop star, pop off
And I can't feel shit but my dick in your bitch
So guess what, there's only one thing left to pop off
Feelin' like a vegetable, with sexy hoes and sexy clothes
They best dressed, yeah I guess they recognize who they dressin' for
She step in the hall to call her man and say she just at home
But my hotel is Valentines, all you see is X and O's
And I can't feel my cardio
Motha fuckas walkin' in with shrooms, now I'm finna feel like Mario
Man I'm livin' with these niggas, fantasizin' life
And I'm prayin' that I make it through the night
Cause a nigga straight rollin'
Hell yeah, nigga, rollin'
Finally famous, niggas, rollin'
(Rollin', rollin', rollin', we ain't slept in weeks)
(Rollin', rollin', rollin', we ain't slept in weeks)
