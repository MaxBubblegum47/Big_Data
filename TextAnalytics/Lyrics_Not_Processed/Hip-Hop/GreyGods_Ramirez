[Intro: DJ Paul]
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz

[Verse 1: Ruby da Cherry]
Flip my fuckin' cross, I don't need a Messiah
Fuck that crown of thorns, I got a crown of barbwire
Burn a fuckin' church, light a blunt with the fire
Fumes got my head spinnin' like a fucking tire
Me and my whole clique are pariahs
Hittin' C notes like the choir
Hittin' C notes like Mariah
Your bitch wanna give me her saliva
Addin' six more bitches to the dick, now that's the Hydra
Pride to the Odyssey, I fucked your mom's vagina
She was soft and wet like papaya
Suicide for hire, holes in my designer
Haters scope me like a fuckin' sniper
Me and $lick are rippin' blades, waitin' to retire

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz

[Verse 2: $crim]
It's the corpse creepin' up the graveyard, snort an eight-ball
Bullets fall like a raindrop on a stable
51/50 psych ward killer
Northside Gorilla, Grey*59 militia
I'm a punk, get the picture, shootin' junk through' my tissue
Walkin' solo with you chillin', sippin' lean with no filler
Triple the six, fuck a bitch, I get that itch I gotta scratch
You just a bitch, you never scrap, I got the demons on my back
They tellin' me is time to fuckin' kill tonight
Ridin' with the lights dim and the scope on sight
What a thrill, what a thrill when the trigger finger pull
Bound for hell, fuck the law, pussyboy, fuck you

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz

[Verse 3: Ramirez]
Creepin' out the jungle, it's the Silverback Gorilla, mane
Beatin' on my chest, I pull up then I blow your fuckin' brains
Throw your ligaments inside a pit and then I watch em' burn
Dancin' 'round the flames, I'm spittin' out these sacrificial words
Roll me up a blunt with the page that I ripped out of the bible
I been feelin' homicidal, grippin' on my fuckin' rifle
Bitch, you thinkin' that you safe but I find out where the fuck you stay
Pull up to your neighborhood and let the fuckin' gauge spray
Boy, I'm saucin', I do this often, I lay inside my coffin rottin'
I sit here plottin', I'm skatin' down through Compton
Caution that when I'm chartin', I'm 'bout to fucking rob 'em
Hang him from the crucifix and leave his family just to watch 'em

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you, this for all you playa hataz
