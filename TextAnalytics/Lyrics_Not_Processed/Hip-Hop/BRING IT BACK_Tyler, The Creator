[Hook: Trouble]
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Don't wanna have to chase you down 'bout them stack
'Cause I will blow ya back, bring it back, this ho here throw it back

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, Converse selling out they got their thumbs tied
Re-up on my deal, let's make it 1-5
And I ain't talking point, that gorilla if I point
He gon' get you, that's the point no lie
Hit the gas and we outta there (skrrt)
Like it's mountain wear, lately, I've been dolo in this bitch
Shoutout Solo, that's big sis, shoutout Frankie, that's big bro
Ya lil' homie running shit, no question
Casio the mothafuckin' watch
800 in a day, my boy, that's just one drop
Invest in stocks, that's the other plan
Two-story bed, I hit the running man
Baby boy, no photo, long sleeve, my polo
Casio, no Rolo', Parmesan, my bolo
VVS my necky, necky heavy flooded
We done broke them levees, anything for Fetti
But don't let it get to you, these niggas tripping
They shoe in the gutter, they gonna ruin their future shit that
They doing like, flexin' on the 'Gram about a bank deposit (hmm)
Yeah, that shit addicting, shit is hypnotizing (hmm)
Claiming that you rich, like, bitch we know you lying (yuh)
What yo backyard look like? What your mama driving?
Mane, call me flame, I'm lighting niggas I'm an animal, fuck is tame?
Young wild nigga, it's the WANG (it's them GOLF boys)
G boy, jeez boy, he that boy, boy, you a decoy (yuh)
Fuckboy, heard you want beef, bitch, you eat soy
Us and them and we ain't got time, bitch, I'm Pink Floyd, yuh
Sapphire's gelatin, niggas is repetitive
AmEx 'cause my pockets is what I can't fit my cheddar in
Sleeping on me, sedative, who these niggas better than?
Is the answer me? Hmm? Uh, no, negative, yuh

[Outro: Trouble & Tyler, The Creator]
Ounces in my mothafuckin' pantry (yeah)
Diamonds on a young nigga, dancin', yeah
Just dropped some bandos on some glasses, yeah
(Golf boys in this shit)
Just dropped your bitch off, man, that hoe so nasty
(Shout out to Trouble)
Huh, all about that paper, can't miss a beat, yeah
(Shout out to Drake, shout out to Mike WiLL)
I'ma get some Cho-Cho, one thing 'bout me, yeah
Gossip all that hoe shit, miss me with that
I could put you front line, just bring it back
