[Intro]
Do do do do do do do

[Verse 1]
A song like you
Is a ripple of the waves
That rises to a hurricane
Oh woah oh oh, oh woah oh
A song like you is a whispered lullaby
That's drowned out by a baby's cry
Oh woah oh oh, oh woah oh

[Pre-Chorus]
A song like you would never tell me the truth
It would turn me on, break me down, make me feel like there is nothing outside this room
A song like you would have me lost in my youth
Oh, baby, a song like you

[Chorus]
I play it every night
I play it every night
A song like you
A song like you

[Verse 2]
A song like you is a ballet black swan dance
That's brought down by a shot-gun blast
Oh woah oh oh, oh woah oh
If I wrote a song that was anything like you
It would turn from color into blue
Oh woah oh woah, oh woah

[Pre-Chorus]
A song like you would never tell me the truth
It would turn me on, break me down, make me feel like there is nothing outside this room
A song like you would have me lost in my youth
Oh, baby, a song like you

[Chorus]
I play it every night
I play it every night
A song like you
A song like you

[Bridge]
Can't get you out my mind
When I'm alone at night
I've been wasting so much time
And it's killing me inside
A song like you

[Chorus]
I play it every night
A song like you (song like you)
I play it every night (every night)
A song like you (song like you)
A song like you

[Outro]
Do do do do do do do
