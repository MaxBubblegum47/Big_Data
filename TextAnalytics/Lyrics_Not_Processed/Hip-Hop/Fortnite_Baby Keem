[Chorus: Baby Keem]
Tell me that it's mine
Tell me that it's mine
When you wanna taste it, I'll let you decide
I'ma play with it, like it's Fortnite
On the way with it, yeah, it's on sight
Tell me that it's mine
Tell me that it's mine
When you wanna taste it, I'll let you decide
I'ma play with it, like it's Fortnite
On the way with it, yeah, it's on sight

[Post-Chorus: Baby Keem]
Uh, wait
Uh, wait

[Verse: Baby Keem]
Lemme see some things, I want all of you, okay
I'm not tryna feel a way
I just want you to feel comfortable, ayy
When you wanna know, I'm on the way
You gon' know when I'm on my way
Fuck that, get dressed, I'm on my way
You gon' know when I'm on my way
When I'm on my way
Pushin' on the gas, I'm a speed addict (addict, ayy)
Runnin' to your ex, he ain't want no static (no static)
When I touch down, I want you ready, ayy
I'ma bust it down, wanna see that fatty
Know a nigga love it when you call me daddy, ayy
20 on the dash, 50 in the backseat, ayy
Goin' this way, I love your ways
Walk around, my bitch on ten

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
Tell me that it's mine
Tell me that it's mine
When you wanna taste it, I'll let you decide
I'ma play with it, like it's Fortnite
On the way with it, yeah, it's on sight
Tell me that it's mine
Tell me that it's mine
When you wanna taste it, I'll let you decide
I'ma play with it, like it's Fortnite
On the way with it, yeah, it's on sight

[Post-Chorus: Baby Keem]
Uh, wait
Uh, wait
