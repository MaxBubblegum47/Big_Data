[Intro: Drego]
Jose the Plug
Man

[Verse 1: Drego & 
Sada Baby
]
My dog just caught the bag, I ain't runnin' from the grams
You got that internet beef, you run straight to the 'Gram
Pussy nigga got shot and he ran to the Gram
If I get shot I'ma shoot 'til it jam in my hand
You in your phone all day, ain't makin' no bands
I told my lil' dawg count it as fast as he can
Soon as he run, it's off with his head
I need that bag, end your life like fuck is you sayin'?

[Verse 2: Sada Baby]
Like I'm that one nigga, fuck the other side
Percocet and new Patek made me come alive
Like how you bomin' Game? I got the chop on me
Ooh, I got the drop on him, JJ up the Glock on him

[Verse 3: Drego]
Man, I got to sneak it in the party, pocket rock' on me
My baby meet you on the side, Chris Rock for you
Boy, I can see the whole field right off Belle Isle
I know he tried to slide 'cause his car loud

[Verse 4: Sada Baby]
Big brick of white look like Brock Lesnar
Got testers, slidin' everywhere because I'm off tether
I might fuck a Cardi B, Ruccis offsettin'
Diamonds wet, look like pee, Skuba R. Kelly

[Verse 5: Drego]
Man, I might sing for the pussy just like R. Kelly
I told her pull up to Club 'Icky, I'ma change the weather
I got her out her Vickys, she won't let me let up
We been in and out them wars, I swear we need some medals

[Verse 6: Sada Baby]
I ain't never had time for no arguments
Big ass shotgun look like Lauri Markkanen
Tooda got the ten, AR with the cartridges
Moncler, Rollie arm-wear, that's my starter kit

[Verse 7: Drego]
Do you believe in my dreams like Coretta, bitch?
Don't let him come in that door, dawg, we measuring
This lil' bitch like Keyshia Cole, dawg, she heaven-sent
Drego lay low and get them extras then

[Verse 8: Sada Baby]
Get to preachin' to you niggas like I'm Malcolm X
And we got powder everywhere, just took it out the press
She hit the road with my load, took it out her dress
She turn me on, now I want to do it
I'm lit, in a foreign whip
Auntie got a script, I'ma flip the bitch
Sweet chin music, watch me kick the shit
Yes I can move it, I be whippin' it
I will pull my gun and get ignorant
I will fuck the party up with my dance moves
I want to take me a trip out to Cancun
But I gotta sit still 'til this bag move
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto
If he know like I know, my niggas we got those
Drums with the hollows, drugs in my poncho
I been wanting big bands since a snot nose, huh

[Verse 9: Drego]
The bag is so feminine, my MT hitters they some gremlins
The narcs hit the block, still gon' hit the fence in my Timberlands
The smoke on the floor, alright, inhale it then
The way you talk you need a show, David Letterman
You ballerina all on it, it's not sellin', damn
I called my baby, whip it quickly, ain't gotta touch my hands
I know some young niggas really eatin' in the ten
All this blood from the streets, I need to wash my hands
You never know who out to get you, better watch your mans
Before you get to blowing cheese, better make a plan
First night again, it wasn't in her plans
Boogie told me fuck the city, bro, we want the rest
Who gon' be there in the end? All this shit a test
All my old hoes say I still hit it the best
Get your mans, dawg, I heard his watch, it tick tick
