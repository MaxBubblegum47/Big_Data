When I was a little bitty boy
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hangin' on a string
She told me it was my ding a ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
And then mother took me to Grammar School
But I stopped all in the vestibule
Every time that bell would ring
Catched me playin' with my ding a ling

[Chorus]
Once I was climbing the garden wall
I slipped and had a terrible fall
I fell so hard I heard bells ring
But held on to my ding a ling

[Chorus]
Once I was swimming cross Turtle creek
Many snappers all around my feet
Sure was hard swimming cross that thing
With both hands holdin' my ding a ling

[Chorus]
This here song it ain't so sad
The cutest little song you ever had
Those of you who will not sing
You must be playin' with your own ding a ling
My ding a ling Your ding a ling, your ding a ling
We saw you playin' with your ding a ling
My ding a ling everybody sing
I want to play with my ding a ling
