[Verse 1 - Stanaj]
I'm stumbling home again
I always have too much
Don't know how but I'm standing
I never can understand it
I can't keep my head on straight
I'm useless at your touch
You know just how to leave me stranded
Don't know why I even try, try, try

[Chorus - Stanaj]
You're bulletproof, ain't no getting to you
I can't break through, anything that I do
It's like I'm playing to lose
You're dangerous, don't know which way to move
I should give up when I give in to you
It's like I'm playing to lose

[Verse 2 - Stanaj]
Eyes open, broken down, I'm hopeless at your door again
I say that I'm cold just to get in
The story, it's old, but it don't end
Your smile speaks miles
It tells me to go, but stay instead
It's like you've been slipping in to my head
Don't know why I even try, try

[Chorus - Stanaj]
You're bulletproof, ain't no getting to you
I can't break through, anything that I do
It's like I'm playing to lose
You're dangerous, don't know which way to move
I should give up when I give in to you
It's like I'm playing to lose

[Bridge - Stanaj]
You're bullet, bullet
You're bullet, bulletproof
You're bullet, bullet
I can't win, I just can't win (I just can't win with you babe)
I can't win, I just can't win (I just can't win with you babe)
I can't win, I just can't win

[Chorus - Stanaj]
You're bulletproof, ain't no getting to you
I can't break through, anything that I do
It's like I'm playing to lose
You're dangerous, don't know which way to move
I should give up when I give in to you
It's like I'm playing to lose
You're bulletproof, ain't no getting to you
I can't break through, anything that I do
It's like I'm playing to lose
You're dangerous, don't know which way to move
I should give up when I give in to you
It's like I'm playing to lose
