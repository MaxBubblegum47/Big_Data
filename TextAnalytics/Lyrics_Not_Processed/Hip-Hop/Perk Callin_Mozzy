Shoutout my nigga Lor Scoota went bananas on this motherfucker
Baltimore fuck that shit do like

[Hook]
I've been thinking about my past and what I had to do
Please don't judge me but this jungle full of animals
They took my nigga and my nigga shit I had to move
I took that trip with hella niggas that's a bad move

[Bridge]
And I can hear them perkys calling
I wish my brother perk could call me
Leazy beat a murder charge
Michael Wise knocked that murder off him

[Verse 1]
Shoutout to snitches that belong in coffins
I'm smoking dodi with the homie and she got me coughing
I got some shottas out in Stockton and we fully rocking
Don't try to pull up in Vallejo cause they get it popping
I love the city all my San Francisco niggas got me
Oakland Raiders function with it we been in the locker
My environment be slimy I'm the living product
We out in Fresno getting slimy with my nigga produkt
Limit your days tryna run off with a nigga product
I think they found that boy shot up homie never got up
I need some forces I'm too grimy for them Balenciagas
I see you Nano that my brother we got different mammas
Got LA Lakers if I call them they pull with yappas
Try use them on my bitch but she don't fuck with condoms
Politics is politics is problem after problem
And I ain't passing out no xanny unless you finna pop 'em
I ain't passin out no blammy unless you finna pop 'em
Teary eyed about my partner when I think about him
Get teary eyed about my daughter when I think about her
I stay inside that prison cell all day dreaming about her
But now we back to balling mamma
That's on my twin sister Meka got them labels calling
Shoutout to Unda Turf they been my people since a toddler
My Aunty Fara told me run it up and get them commas
Stretch already helped a nigga touch 100 thousand
What type of baller let his people live in public housings
You lost a soldier back to back and ain't do nothing about it
You took that hooker on a date ain't got no money out it
They say they love me but swear don't give no fucks about me
They say they love me but swear don't give no fucks about me
When gangsta shit be kicking off you never come around us
Now that we popping with this music stay the fuck from around us
Ya I been popping up and using all these drugs around me
I damn near fainted in Tacoma so much love around me
San Diego went banana that's my type of party
Had Bladadah come on and niggas went retarded
All this jewelry got me looking like an easy target
I'm from 4th but on the Trays I used to bleed the market
Fuck the prisons and the court and the police department
That nigga talking like he activated he just barking
We leave your momma house and show up to your bitch apartment
I swear I love life but I've been living heartless
We leave your momma house and show up to your bitch apartment
I swear I love life but I've been living heartless

[Bridge x2]
And I can hear them perkys calling
I wish my brother perk could call me
Leazy beat a murder charge
Michael Wise knocked that murder off him

[Hook]
I was thinking about my past and what I had to do
Please don't judge me but this jungle full of animals
They took my nigga and my nigga shit I had to move
I took that trip with hella niggas that's a bad move
