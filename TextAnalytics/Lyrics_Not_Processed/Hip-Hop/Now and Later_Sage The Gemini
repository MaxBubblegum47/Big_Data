[Hook]
I can be ya lifesaver
Treat me like a jawbreaker
You got 31 flavors, baby
You can get this now and later, now and later
You can get this now and later, now and later
It's your choice

[Verse 1]
Stop playin', you actin' like I don't do this
Build an empire, you Cookie, I'ma be Lucius
Give you good head until you get a contusion
If you don't come back, I think I'mma lose it
I think I'mma lose it
If I ever had ya number, I think I would use it
I'm feelin' some way, you know I hate losin'
If ya heart was in a bank, I'd rob it just to prove it
C'mon, you a mean diva
I'll grab your problems by the neck like I'm John Cena
You got a past, I ain't get to go to prom, either
So don't make it hard to believe that I ain't need ya

[Pre-Hook]
You're beautiful like spring time
Let me know you in the meantime
Hopefully, if things seem right
I'mma be needing your ring size

[Hook]
I can be ya lifesaver
Treat me like a jawbreaker
You got 31 flavors, baby
You can get this now and later, now and later
You can get this now and later, now and later
It's your choice

[Verse 2]
I love attitudes, but not the drama
You made it to my heart, hamdoullah al salama
Salam aleikoum you leave maa salama
You know my charm, you say it brings problems
Let me love you, put nothing above you
If we see your ex, I'll overly kiss and hug you
Make him jealous, now he's overzealous
Tryna act cool, I think he's over-selling
I don't mean no harm
I'm always there, Sage from State Farm
Whatever you do, don't ban me from your heart
I pray to God he don't keep us apart cause

[Pre-Hook]
You're beautiful like spring time
Let me know you in the meantime
Hopefully, if things seem right
I'mma be needing your ring size

[Hook]
I can be ya lifesaver
Treat me like a jawbreaker
You got 31 flavors, baby
You can get this now and later, now and later
You can get this now and later, now and later
It's your choice

[Bridge]
Let me see what you came to do
You're the sugar rush to my sweet tooth
You're the sugar rush to my sweet tooth
You're the sugar rush to my sweet tooth
Let me see what you came to do
You're the sugar rush to my sweet tooth
You're the sugar rush to my sweet tooth
You're the sugar rush to my sweet tooth

[Hook]
I can be ya lifesaver
Treat me like a jawbreaker
You got 31 flavors, baby
You can get this now and later, now and later
You can get this now and later, now and later
It's your choice
