[Verse 1: Navia Robinson]
Hard work's always faceless (faceless)
It shouldn’t matter what your gender or race is
Show me someone who is better
And we can watch them when they crumble under pressure
Girl, you got a story
It's something for the whole wide world
No guts no glory
There's strength in every girl

[Chorus: Cozi Zuehlsdorff, Kylee Russell, Olivia Rodrigo & Every Artist here]
All I’m asking
Is you open your mind
Do the right thing
Don't give up the fight
'Cause we didn't come here to cheer
We came to lead,and we're right here
So open your eyes and see
You can be legendary
You can be legendary
Yeah, yeah
Just open your eyes and see
We can be legendary

[Verse 2: Meg Donnelly w/ Navia Robinson]
No fight's ever easy
But we can win when we all start believing
We're stronger when we come together
Never runnin', no retreat, no surrender
We’re part of a movement
Let’s take it to the whole wide world
Stand tall, let's prove it
There’s strength in every girl

[Chorus: Cozi Zuehlsdorff, Kayla Maisonet, Olivia Rodrigo]
All I'm asking
Is you open your mind
Do the right thing
Don't give up the fight
'Cause we didn’t come here to cheer
We came to lead, and we're right here
So open your eyes and see
You can be legendary
You can be legendary
Yeah, yeah
Just open your eyes and see
We can be legendary

[Verse 3: Sky Katz]
Yo!
Now all my independent girls, stand up
Stand up
And all my strong girls, time to speak up
Speak up
We need to show the whole world that we're here to stay
This is legendary, so remember our names

[Verse 4: Devore Ledridge, Kayla Maisonet, Madison Hu & Jenna Ortega]
Make history into 'herstory
'Cause we can be anything that we wanna be
And since we're all sisters, all races and creeds
Let our battle cry be victory

[Chorus:]
All I'm asking
Is you open your mind
Do the right thing
Don't give up the fight
'Cause we didn't come here to cheer
We came to lead, and  we're right here
So open your eyes and see
You can be legendary
Yeah, you can be legendary
Yeah, yeah
So open your eyes and see
We can be legendary

[Chorus:]
All I'm asking
We can be legendary
Is you open your mind
We can be legendary
Do the right thing
Don't give up the fight
'Cause we didn't come here to cheer
We came to lead, and we're right here
Just open your eyes and see
You can be legendary

Oh Oh
Yeah, yeah
So open your eyes and see
