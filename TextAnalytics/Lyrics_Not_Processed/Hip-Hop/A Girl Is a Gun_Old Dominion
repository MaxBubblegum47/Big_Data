[Verse 1]
Seems innocent enough when your buying the drinks at the bar and you're both getting loaded
Don't even know just the danger you're in cause you're so caught up in the moment
But you shoot a smile cuts through the smoke
Hits you before you even know

[Chorus]
A girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So before careful when you're holding one
Cause a girl is a gun

[Verse 2]
She's cold and she's hot
She's fun but she's not some play thing two dollar pistol
Say the right thing she'll go off with a bang
But be careful cause she kicks a little
Hold her just right don't let her down
You're gonna get hurt if you mess around

[Chorus]
A girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So before careful when you're holding one
Cause a girl is a gun

[Chorus]
Yeah a girl is a gun
She's harder to handle than you think son
You feel safe when you're with her
Think twice before you pull the trigger
She feels good in your hand from the first little spark
But guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
Heartbreak's a bitch
She'll kill you with a kiss
So before careful when you're holding one
Cause a girl is a gun
Yeah a girl is a gun
