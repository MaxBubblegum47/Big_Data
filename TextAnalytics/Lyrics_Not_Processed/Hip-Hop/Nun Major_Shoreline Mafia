[Intro]
After FOX 11 first aired this story promo, members of Shoreline Mafia posted to their Instagram account this response: Expletive FOX, we sippin' juice for life
Beat Boy taught me
Ron-Ron do that shit

[Chorus: Ohgeesy]
I been ballin' out, boy it ain't nothin' major
I can never switch, I can never be a hater
Tryna hit a lick, you get hit with the lasers
I'm smoking hella pack while I count up this paper

[Verse 1: Ohgeesy]
Ballin', this ain't no free throw
Got your bitch on my dick, she a freak ho
Pour a six, I remix while she deep throat
Drop the top off the whip but bitch this ain't a Jeep though
Fast whips, bad bitch, you knowing how we go
I'm a migo, I ain't talking 'bout the trio
And the pack hella musty, smell like some BO
You buying more than one, then I might cut a deal
For real, that's for real
And the pack hella musty, smell like some BO
You buy more than one, then I might cut a deal for real

[Chorus: Ohgeesy]
I been ballin' out, boy it ain't nothin' major
I can never switch, I can never be a hater
Tryna hit a lick, you get hit with the lasers
I'm smoking hella pack while I count up this paper
I been ballin' out, boy it ain't nothin' major
I can never switch, I can never be a hater
Tryna hit a lick, you get hit with the lasers
I'm smoking hella pack while I count up this paper

[Verse 2: Ohgeesy]
I be fucking hoes but it ain't nothin' major
Oh what baby, you ain't know I was a player?
Runnin' around the city, think I should run for mayor
Let a bitch choose up, you the type of nigga save her, damn
All you niggas disappointments
Nut on your bitch, rub it on her like some ointment
Got your bitch on the way, she got a dick appointment
And all my niggas finna join
You be worried 'bout a bitch, I be worried bout some coin
Good steak on my plate, you be eating sirloin
Good lean in my cup, every sip I enjoy
I don't trick on a bitch, she a bitch I employ, ayy
But she gotta trick on me
Its a fee for the 'Gees, make her G off her knees
I ain't tryna be the P, but she begged on her knees
So she run that shit up and run it right back to me, ayy

[Chorus: Ohgeesy]
I been ballin' out, boy it ain't nothin' major
I can never switch, I can never be a hater
Tryna hit a lick, you get hit with the lasers
I'm smoking hella pack while I count up this paper
I been ballin' out, boy it ain't nothin' major
I can never switch, I can never be a hater
Tryna hit a lick, you get hit with the lasers
I'm smoking hella pack while I count up this paper
