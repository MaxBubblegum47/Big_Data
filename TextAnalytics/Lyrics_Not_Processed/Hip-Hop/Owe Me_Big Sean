[Chorus]
All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
For ever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Verse 1]
Feel like you owe me checks, owe me time, owe me sex
Long nights, no reply, I got no regrets
You disrespect, disrespect, 
only time I seen you now's on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to, you got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals, now you back it's our revival
They don't make you feel like I do, they didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me
Cause you know you got that walk from me
How you dress and how you talk from me, yeah
Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya
It took us being over to see all I did for ya, damn

[Chorus]
All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gonna take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Verse 2]
I'm just trying to let the past pass
Ain't no future in that, yeah
I stay 100 like my dash, yeah
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass, glass
Honestly, I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play the blame game
Point the fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust, I don't wanna have a fake us

[Chorus]
But all that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Outro]
My friends say I should be over you
Getting hurt every time I'm close to you
I think me and you are overdue
I think this is what we supposed to do
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line
