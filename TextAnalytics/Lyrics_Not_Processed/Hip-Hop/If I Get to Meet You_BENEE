[Verse 1]
It was nice talkin' to you
I'm still thinkin' about it
A message from you in the morning
I'm surprised you even called me
I really can't predict what you'll do
I'm scared I might start to annoy you

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't seem to figure you out
Still my words spill out of my mouth
You're listening, how could I not want you now?

[Chorus]
If I get to meet you
Will you tell all your friends about it?
I still can't figure you out, no
All these words spill out from my mouth

[Verse 2]
Your eyes are a pale blue
But still, I can't see through you
So why can't I see through you?
I find it hard to talk to all
The other boys start to reach out to me
Only want to talk to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't seem to figure you out
Still my words spill out of my mouth
You're listening, how could I not want you now?
Can't seem to figure you out
Still my words spill out of my mouth
You're listening, how could I not want you now?

[Chorus]
If I get to meet you
Will you tell all your friends about it?
I still can't figure you out, no
All these words spill out from my mouth
If I gеt to meet you
Will you tell all your friends about it?
I still can't figure you out, no
All thеse words spill out from my mouth
