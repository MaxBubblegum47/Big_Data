[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus 1]
You come around girl I get weak you put me in a trance
I want your love, I know it's worth it, just give me a chance
I know you angry at my actions when they hit the fan
Just want your love, I know you scared, baby just hold my hand

[Verse 1]
Cause you come around girl I smile
You on your way but I need you right now
We run a race but it took us some miles
We can just vibe and just chill for a while
People gonna talk they just hate cause they mad
You left me before baby girl just come back
I know you the baddest I don't mean to brag
I need your love so just stay where your at (yeah)
It's been too long I need your love you got what I'm fiending for
And if you feel alone just hit up my phone cause pain is like rain and it pours
It ain't been the same since you been away I need you Your all that I adore
I hate to waste time this could be the climb You know I could never ignore you
Your style and persona I love you
We make us a pack if you want to
You need some love if you want to
We need to lay down some ground rules
We need to lay down some ground rules
Bae hit my line I need round two

[Chorus 2]
When you come around got my heart get to speeding
I need you I love you they hate for no reason
I'm only six feet but I fell in the deep end
I know sometimes my actions feel so misleading
You only got one chance to give me your love
I pour my heart out to you sometimes, girl I feel like I'm giving up

[Verse 2]
Cause you come around girl I smile
You on your way but I need you right now
We run a race but it took us some miles
We can just vibe and just chill for a while
People gonna talk they just hate cause they mad
You left before baby girl just come back
I know you the baddest I don't mean to brag
I need your love so just stay where you're at (yeah)
It's been too long I need your love you got what I'm fiending for
And if you feel alone just hit up my phone cause pain is like rain and it pours
It ain't been the same since you been away I need you, Your all that I adore
I hate to waste time this could be the climb You know I could never ignore you
Your style and persona I love you
We make us a pack if you want to
You need some love if you want to
We need to lay down some ground rules
We need to lay down some ground rules
