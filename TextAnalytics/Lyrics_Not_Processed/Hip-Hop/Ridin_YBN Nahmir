[Intro: Yung Bans]
Yeah yeah, huh, ayy

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Ridin' with that .40, ridin' with that .40 with a beam (Hey, yeah)
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah
If it ain't 'bout the money, huh, ayy
Ridin' with that .40, ridin' with that .40 with a beam (Hey, yeah)
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah
If it ain't 'bout the money

[Verse 1: Yung Bans]
Hmm, I'm on the beach with my feet up, ayy
Everybody say I'm switchin', I don't speak enough, hmm, ayy
I just turn my speakers up, hmm, ayy
I just turn my speakers up, huh
I'm movin' on just like my lease was up, ayy
And I'm still poppin' these Percs, lil' bitch, I'm geekin' up, huh
I might fuck that lil' ho if she freak enough, ayy
Then I have a new bitch 'fore the week was up (Ayy)

Ridin' with that .40, ridin' with that .40 with a beam (Hey, yeah)

If it ain't 'bout the money, huh, ayy
Ridin' with that .40, ridin' with that .40 with a beam (Hey, yeah)

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
Now I grind for that money, I got that green, yeah
I'm grindin' for that cheese, yeah, that cheese, yeah
I run off with your honey, she off the bean, yeah
She wanna stay the week, I make her leave now (Ayy)
Gettin' high, yeah, on the West Side, yeah
All my life, yeah, think that I'ma die here

[Verse 3: YBN Nahmir]
One day they caught me loafin' after droppin' off my bitch (Droppin' off my bitch)
They sent a couple shots but I'm just glad that nigga missed (He got no aim, nigga)
Ducked down, started clapping, tried to flip that whole whip (Grrah, pow, pow, pow)
But I'd rather take a life before my mama see me stiff (Ayy, that's on my mama)
So I'm clutchin' on that .44 when I'm trippin' (Ayy, grrah, pow, pow, pow)
Trey paralyzed, but I'm just glad that nigga livin' (Ayy, I'm just glad that nigga livin')
Please don't come to me when that nigga granny end up missin' (When that nigga end up missin', and)
I was coolin' out in Cali, workin', bitch, I was gettin' it (Ayy, workin', bitch, I was gettin' it, huh?)

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
Ridin' with that .40, ridin' with that .40 with a beam (Hey, yeah)
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah
If it ain't 'bout the money, huh, ayy
Ridin' with that .40, ridin' with that .40 with a beam (Hey, yeah)
Dollar signs all I see
If it ain't 'bout the money, I ain't worried 'bout it, yeah
If it ain't 'bout the money
