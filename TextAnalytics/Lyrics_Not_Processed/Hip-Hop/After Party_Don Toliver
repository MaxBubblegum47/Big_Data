[Chorus]
Okay, I pull up, hop out at the after party
You and all your friends, yeah, they love to get naughty
Sippin' on that Henn', I know you love that Bacardi (

1942, I take you back in that 'Rari
Okay, I pull up, hop out at the after party
You and all your friends, yeah, they love to get naughty
Sippin' on that Henn', I know you love that Bacardi
1942, I take you back in that 'Rari

[Verse 1]
Switchin' lanes and I'm seein' lights, you know I watch the curb
Smokin' weed, you know I'm gettin' high, you know it calm my nerves
Trappin' hard, pumpin' non-stop, the bag I had to earn
You can try, but you might fail again, you know you never learn

[Pre-Chorus]
Came in with a bottle, I was trippin'
And I took a couple shots and now I'm dizzy
It got me burning up, burning up
Insides burning up, burning up (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Okay, I pull up, hop out at the after party
You and all your friends, yeah, they love to get naughty
Sippin' on that Henn', I know you love that Bacardi
1942, I take you back in that 'Rari
Okay, I pull up, hop out at the after party
You and all your friends, yeah, they love to get naughty
Sippin' on that Henn', I know you love that Bacardi
1942, I take you back in that 'Rari

[Verse 2]
Uh, poppin' meds (Uh) out in the meadows (Yeah)
She like a little red (Uh), in her stilettos (Yeah)
Anytime you live (Uh) out in the ghetto (Yeah)
You try to duck the feds (Uh), they need to let go

[Pre-Chorus]
Came in with a bottle, I was trippin'
And I took a couple shots, it got me dizzy
It got me burning up, burning up
Insides burning up, burning up (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Okay, I pull up, hop out at the after party
You and all your friends, yeah, they love to get naughty
Sippin' on that Henn', I know you love that Bacardi
1942, I take you back in that 'Rari
Okay, I pull up, hop out at the after party
You and all your friends, yeah, they love to get naughty
Sippin' on that Henn', I know you love that Bacardi
1942, I take you back in that 'Rari

[Outro]
Okay, I pull up— (Okay, I pull up)
Okay, I pull up— (Okay, I pull up)
Okay, I pull up (Okay, I pull up), hop out at the after party
Okay, I pull up (Okay, I pull up), hop out at the after party
Okay, I pull up (Okay, I pull up), hop out at the after party
Okay, I pull up (Okay, I pull up), hop out at the after party
