[Verse]
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done

[Chorus]
Now we’re at square one
And we wait too long
'Til we’re at square one
We never done...

[Verse]
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done

[Chorus]
Now we’re at square one
And we wait too long
'Til we’re at square one
Til we’re at square one

[Verse]
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life round here
We're never done
