[Intro: Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up, wait a minute

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone & (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony)]
(Hold up, wait a minute)
I never need no other loving but yours
And like a drug out of a habit keep me coming for more
'Cause you're so potent, level-headed it's a habit nigga
Just floatin', coasting, so know so
Meet me in the sky, we fly like shining stars
We outta here, might as well be climbin' Mars
I was riding in my car when I saw you hit the bass like
(Hold up, wait...)
We need to love another
Tell the one they're everything you need
Living reality within your dreams
Iâ€™m not trynna be hassled by ratchets, that shit's the worse
I'd rather be with my bad bitch
She the whole reason I left my last chick
She was living for the future so she past tense. I told her--
(Hold up, wait a minute)

[Chorus: Zhu & (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony)]
I don't want no other
Girl you gotta give me more
I don't want no other
So what you waitin' for?
I don't want no other
Ooh, do you know for sure?
I don't want no other
(Hold up, wait a minute)

[Trumpet interlude: Trombone Shorty]

(Hold up, wait a minute)

[Trumpet riff: Trombone Shorty]

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone & (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony)]
I'm addicted to her sex, damn she hot
I'm fiendin' for the the love that she got
I tie her legs up around me like a knot
Like baby boy, wind, I've been doin' the squats
Ooh, spontaneous as soon as I'm in the spot
If you're lucky you'll watch and then she don't stop
She made the choice handcuffs and the freaky props
We disturbin' the peace (I called the cops)

[Bridge: Zhu & (Bizzy Bone)]
(Girl you know that I know)
You know that I am the one
(Don't give me that act like don't you know)
I'll give you all that you want
(Girl you know you feel me too)
You know that I am the one
(Gotta get you back in that birthday suit
That birthday suit)
(Hold up, wait a minute)

[Chorus: Zhu & (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony)]
I don't want no other
Girl you gotta give me more
I don't want no other
So what you waitin' for?
I don't want no other
Ooh, do you know for sure?
I don't want no other
(Hold up, wait a minute)

[Trumpet interlude]

[Outro: Zhu]
Don't look too good for me and you
I would trade in all I got just to love you
Don't look too good for me and you
I would trade in all I got just to love you

Yeah---

Don't look too good for me and you
I would trade in all I got just to love you
Don't look too good for me and you
I would trade in all I got just to love you
