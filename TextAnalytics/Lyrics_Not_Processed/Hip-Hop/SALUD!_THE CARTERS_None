Uh, uh, uh

[Chorus: Beyoncé &

Put it on ice (ice, ice, ice), celebrate that we made it
I put it on Christ (that's on God, yeah)
Lord knows it takes hella patience
When your name is a verb and these comments absurd
And they swear they know you better than you know yourself
'Cause you control yourself,
  cheers to me and you, 
salud!
Baby, look me in my eye, take a cheers to you and I, 
cheers to you
Baby, look me in my eye, make a cheers to you and I, salud!

I'm convinced that I'm truly the GOAT (GOAT, GOAT, GOAT)
Sosa, the Elohim intervene like boy you the truth
Don't die (don't die, don't die)
Angels on both sides, toast with mimosas (both sides, both sides)
Your president tweeting about Hov like he knows us
My road to the top was to take what you owe us
I give a fuck what that man find vulgar
Just look in my eyes when you toast us

Mazel tov, put up your glass
Put up your last, put up yo bag (put up yo bag)

Let them all know (salud)
This what we ball for, yo
