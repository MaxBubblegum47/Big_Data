[Intro: Baby Keem]
This feel like revenge love to me
I wanna say torture
Been harder to hide behind my dreams
Begin at a broken

[Verse 1: Dominic Fike]
I see you askin' for war, I look for whom to call
Baby, you're talkin' to ghosts, I'm not here anymore
I'm at the speed of sound, will take too long
I'd weigh you down with all my love and you start

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
This feel like revenge love to me
I wanna say torture (I wanna say torture)
Been harder to hide behind my dreams
Begin at a broken (Begin at a broken)
This feel like revenge love to me
I wanna say torture (I wanna say torture)
Been harder to hide behind my dreams
Begin at a broken (Begin at a broken)

[Verse 2: Baby Keem]
You're toxic, stand back
Baby like the lights on, stare attack
I reckon I'm wrong, I reckon I wack
Mentally, you're not grown, you got no class
Where'd you get that outfit? I bought you that at Saks, huh
I don't need your apology, you ain't me and that's trash
My heart like a fortress, kicked out, you can't get back
So I don't want your analogies, you kicked me and that's wack

[Outro: Baby Keem]
This feel like revenge love to me
I wanna say torture (I wanna say torture)
Been harder to hide behind my dreams
Begin at a broken
