[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah my bruddah
Yeah, meet me at Costco
Yeah I need to borrow your Costco card
I need to buy a bag of rice for my mudda
Yeah, yeah
Car park, Costco yeah
My bruddah y'know

[Verse 1]
Hey
It's been a minute
Hey
Back with a vengeance
Come like I'm back from a sentence
Prayed up, repentance
Slim down, did I mention?
I found this girl interesting
So I started investing
Yeah, I thought that was a drop
Did I miss the drop?
Anyway

[Chorus]
Girl you look good but your morning breath anti
Keep on your panty
Ghana man, Ashanti
With a little bit of Fante
Makeup was Fenty
She was wearing plenty
Let me call auntie
For the Jollof rice

[Verse 2]
That man discombobulated
We pulled up like it's orchestrated
Saw that whip, it was so frustrating
The girls see us, now they're concentrating
Yo babes
Met a girl from East
Name was Elise
She was Sudanese
Had on grey jeans and a little white tee
So, so pretty
Could be wifey on some M1llionz ting
I thought why pree?
Then, why not?
She could be a opp, she's just chillin' on the block
Had a hole in her sock
I put the girl in obbo
And head back like N'Golo Kanté
Always with her friend, Shanté
Said I look like Sadio Mané
I bought the jacket with a fleece
Add five g's
Went overseas, splashed it on my jeans
And a pair of double C's
LV on a fleece
I bought it for my niece
She tore up my keys, how I run it?
Made some losses but we still in profit
Said you're ballin' but you're not, let's be honest
Said you buy that whip, you ain't coppin'
All these fibs, I need a room in the Tropics

[Chorus]
Girl you look good but your morning breath anti
Keep on your panty
Ghana man, Ashanti
With a little bit of Fante
Makeup was Fenty
She was wearing plenty
Let me call auntie
For the Jollof rice
Girl you look good but your morning breath anti
Keep on your panty
Ghana man, Ashanti
With a little bit of Fante
Makeup was Fenty
She was wearing plenty
Let me call auntie
For the Jollof rice

[Outro]
Hey, mans got the rice
Mans finally got the rice, cuz
Mans got the rice
