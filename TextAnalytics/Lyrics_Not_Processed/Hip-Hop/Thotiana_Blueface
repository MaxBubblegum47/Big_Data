[Intro]
Blueface, baby
Yeah aight
Bust down, Thotiana
Yeah aight
I wanna see you bust down

[Chorus]
Bust down, Thotiana (Bust down, Thotiana)
I wanna see you bust down (Over)
Pick it up, now break that shit down (Break it down)
Speed it up, then slow that shit down, on the gang (Slow it down)
Bust it (Bust down), bust down, bust it, bust it
Bust down, on the gang (Over)
Bust down, Thotiana (Bust down, Thotiana)
I wanna see you bust down (Over)
Pick it up, now break that shit down (Break it down)
Speed it up, now slow that shit down, on the gang (Slow it down)
Bust it (Bust down), bust down, bust it, bust it
Bust down, on the gang (Over)

[Verse]
Blueface, baby
Yeah aight, I'm every woman's fantasy (Blueface, baby)
Mama always told me I was gon' break hearts
I guess it's her fault, stupid, don't be mad at me (Don't be mad at me)
I wanna see you bust down (Bust down)
Bend that shit over, on the gang (Yeah aight)
Make that shit clap
She threw it back so I had to double back, on the gang (On the gang)
Smackin', high off them drugs (Off them drugs)
I tried tell myself two times was enough (Was enough)
Then a nigga relapsed, on the dead locs
Ain't no runnin', Thotiana, you gon' take these damn strokes (Thotiana)
I beat the pussy up, now it's a murder scene
Keep shit player, Thotiana, like you ain't never even heard of me (Blueface, baby)
Bust down, Thotiana, I wanna see you bust down (Bust down)
Bend that shit over (Bend it over)
Yeah aight, now make that shit clap, on the gang (Make it clap)
Now toot that thing up (Toot it up)
Throw that shit back (Throw it back)
I need my extras, on the dead locs

[Chorus]
Bust down, Thotiana (Bust down, Thotiana)
I wanna see you bust down (Over)
Pick it up, now break that shit down (Break it down)
Speed it up, then slow that shit down, on the gang (Slow it down)
Bust it (Bust down), bust down, bust it, bust it
Bust down, on the gang (Over)
Bust down, Thotiana (Bust down, Thotiana)
I wanna see you bust down (Over)
Pick it up, now break that shit down (Break it down)
Speed it up, now slow that shit down, on the gang (Slow it down)
Bust it (Bust down), bust down, bust it, bust it
Bust down, on the gang (Over)
