[Verse 1: Summer Walker, Summer Walker & Jhené Aiko]
If them bitches 'round you, better be blood
If it ain't me or your mama, shouldn't be showin' you no love
Please forgive me, I know that I'm stingy
'Cause baby, I'm gang 'bout you
Ain't playing no games 'bout you
I'll go to Hell or jail 'bout you, boy, I
I'll go to Hell or jail 'bout you, boy
I'll go to Hell or jail 'bout you, boy
I'll go to Hell or jail 'bout you, boy

[Chorus: Summer Walker, Summer Walker & Jhené Aiko]
I've been waiting so long for a love like this
I've been waiting so long for a love like this
I've been waiting so long for a love like this
Waiting so long, yeah

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
That's on my mama, yeah, that's on the hood
Don't want no problems, I wish a bitch would
Try to come between us, it won't end up good
You know I love you like no one else could
I'd go to Hell and back for ya
Bend over backwards, acrobats for ya, yeah
I'd go up to bat for ya
Even when shit lookin' bad for ya
I been waiting so long for a love like this
It's a feeling so strong, I don't wanna resist
Like you can't do no wrong, got me losin' my shit
Gotta loosen my grip, nah
Fuck that, my baby, you all mine
Greatest of all time
You better tell them hoes fall in line
I do not play about mine
You know this energy so right
Don't put up no fight
You know I never tell no lie
I want you for life

[Verse 3: Summer Walker]
Don't have me lookin' foolish
Don't have me feelin' stupid
Choose a lover, you got me all tied up
Sometimes you just, you get me all fired up

[Chorus: Summer Walker & Jhené Aiko]
I've been waiting so long for a love like this
I've been waiting so long for a love like this
I've been waiting so long for a love like this
Waiting so long (So long)

[Outro]
Your lovin' can't be too much, for me, too much
We got London on the track
