Part 1: Prod. by [?]

[Intro]
Hold tight Max Branning, my slime

[Verse]
I counted like three, two, one (One, one)
Santa, are you dumb?
You just cussed my mum (Mum, mum)
Your jaw will get spun
Rudolph left, he run (Run, run)
Trust, he didn't want none
The reindeer had a gun
Something’s gonna get bun’ (Bun’)
Bunsen burner, yeah, we light it
Pork on the table, I don't bite it
Is that bacon?
Give it to Jason
He's Jafaican
Fam, he's Asian
Talkin' 'bout bumba, bumba, bumbaclit
This brudda, what a neek
Yo, Shafique, pass the turkey
He said, “I can't, it's doing burpees”
Who's in the room? Let me see
Is that Asznee kissing Dafnee who has acne on her forehead?
All this happening on a moped
I turn left
I see Santa holding a panda drinking Fanta from Uganda
You think it's banter?

Part 2: Prod. by Gotcha

[Intro]
Ayy, lemme switch dis
You dun’ know
Ayy, Young Potassium, I see you
Carbon Monoxide, you dun’ know the ting

[Verse]
One, two, three, four, five
Once, I caught a fish alive
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Then I let it go again
And again and again, then that fish went pen
I saw Kesha, I saw Ken
He was holding a skeng under his skirt
He called it “kilt”
Big man, I don't kill
Holding my drink
It got spilt
That was coconut milk
Man, I go ching-ching-ching for the Chingford
See your ex in Bedford
Hold tight, man like Pickford
Duck man down in dat Ford, Ford, Ford
I went Barking
Couldn't find parking
Kinda jarring
Had the .44, long like biscuit (Biscuit, biscuit)
'fore bed, I drink Nesquik (Nesquik, Nesquik)
Yo, yo
Man's black, my hair is black
Tracksuit black
Your girl is zapped, she's got a back
Your sister’s clapped
What is that?
Round of applause, clap-clap-clap
Flex with a stack? It ain't yours
Big man, put your lies on pause
Stay in your lane, sit with Jane
Man got a Twitter, troll insane
Bring the tissue, I need Andrex
High school prom, your mum wore spandex
Where's my ex? I don't call her
Where's my next? I don't know her
Uh, uh
It's a good time now, I wanna celebrate
Good time now, I don't wanna be late
Good time now, I don't wanna be rude
Good time now, uh, where's the food?
It's in ching-ching-ching for the Chingford
Duck man down in a big Ford
Fly your girl like Concorde
143 on the dashboard (Board)
It's in ching-ching-ching for the Chingford
Duck man down in a big Ford
Fly your girl like Concorde
143 on the dashboard (Board)

[Outro]
You dun’ know

Pain in my left chest
Volume 40
