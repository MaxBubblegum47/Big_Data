[Chorus]
I need a bad bitch (Okay), uh, Addison Rae
Lil' shawty the baddest (Yeah), yeah, and she got her ways
Lil' shawty a savage, yeah, lil' shawty don't play

Lil' shawty a savage, yeah, lil' shawty don't play
I need a bad bitch, I need me some bad shit, Addison Rae

[Verse 1]
I'ma take you out
Let me show you all the things that I'm about
The last girl that I was with kinda left me down
And I wish her well, but baby, now it's time for ours
She told me that I'm not enough, not enough
She caught me out a couple times, couple times
She told me that she done with me, done with me
She told me this the last time, and that's why (That's why)

[Chorus]
I need a bad bitch (Okay), uh, Addison Rae
Lil' shawty the baddest (Yeah), yeah, and she got her ways
Lil' shawty a savage, yeah, lil' shawty don't play
I need a bad bitch, I need me some bad shit, Addison Rae
I need a bad bitch (Okay), uh, Addison Rae
Lil' shawty the baddest (Yeah), yeah, and she got her ways
Lil' shawty a savage, yeah, lil' shawty don't play
I need a bad bitch, I need me some bad shit, Addison Rae

[Verse 2]
I remember times I would come over, we was fuckin' on your sofa
Funny how times change, now I'm onto bigger and better, damn, who told ya?
That I was fuckin' on your friends?
I know that we left off on the wrong foot, but I'm tryna make amends
Not talkin' a TV show, but she breaking bad, yeah
You got me reminiscin', takin' it back, yeah
Back when they loved me for me, not my bag, yeah
Now all shawty want is a Gucci bag, yeah, Louis bag (Bag, bag, bag)

[Chorus]
I need a bad bitch, uh, Addison Rae
Lil' shawty the baddest, yeah, and she got her ways
Lil' shawty a savage, yeah, lil' shawty don't play
I need a bad bitch, I need me some bad shit, Addison Rae
I need a bad bitch, uh, Addison Rae
Lil' shawty the baddest, yeah, and she got her ways
Lil' shawty a savage, yeah, lil' shawty don't play
I need a bad bitch, I need me some bad shit, Addison Rae
