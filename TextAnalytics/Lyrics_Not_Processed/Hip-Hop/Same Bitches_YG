[Intro: Post Malone]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I been in L.A. too long
How I see the same bitches everywhere I go?
It don't really matter where they from
Actin' or a model, heard it all before
Population four million, how I see the same bitches?
(How I see the same bitches?) Yeah, yeah
Population four million, how I see the same bitches?
(How I see the same bitches?) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I hit your DM, baby
Took the screenshot, yeah, you tried to play me
I bet this shit was good for your reputation
I just let it go, so I could see you naked
Holy moly, look at what you rolled in
Million followers, but your bumpers broken
What's your focus? Tell me what your goal is
I know you only like me
'Cause I just spent a hundred bands in one night
Spent a hundred bands in one night
I know you wanna live this life
But I can't make a ho a housewife (Oh, no)
What's your name? Who's your daddy?
Is he rich like me? Is he rich like me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone & 
G-Eazy

I been in L.A. too long

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Everywhere I go I see the same ho
Always post selfies on the 'Gram from a angle, a Catfish
Hollywood devil, not a angel
Her bag is Chanel, but she drives a Durango
Yeah, and I'm gettin' to the queso
Woke and I'm hip to the game, so I'm thankful
OGs put me on tours, so I'm laced, bro
Real recognizin' that you don't speak the lingo
Clothes all new, not a wrinkle
Givin' you the game, gettin' sprinkled
Bottles on deck and my drink full
I turn into a beast, I'm a dog, I'm a pitbull
This life did it to me, I can't switch back
If I take her then you'll never get your bitch back
Yeah, the beat knockin', yeah, this shit clap
Welcome to the west it's where people gettin' rich at, ayy
