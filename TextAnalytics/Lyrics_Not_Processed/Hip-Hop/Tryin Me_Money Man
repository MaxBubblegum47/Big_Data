[Intro]
Hold on
Trauma Man, Trauma Man
Hold on
Trauma Man, Trauma Man
Money Tone
Money Tone

[Chorus]
I get that check and I stack it
My money blue like it's Crippin'
Sell you a brick and I'm dippin'
Weigh that shit up in an updated kitchen
Fuck that lil' bitch on an island inside of the kitchen
I ride with dead people, I'm superstitious
She give me head on her knees, she religious
No, I'm not Thug, but I ran up them digits by using my digits
They wanna fuck with the kid like I'm Billy
They wanna fuck with the kid like I'm Sy Ari
These the Moon Rocks, you not high as me
You not 'bout that life, don't you lie to me
Just like a horse, she gon' ride me
BC a secret society
Draco for niggas who trying me
Draco for niggas who trying me

[Verse 1]
I buy a house, then start a grow in it, lil' mama throwin' it
I pour a four in it, I'm going slow in it
Living for now, we live for the moment
She say when I touch her, she wet as an ocean
I crack the seal on some purple potion
Play with the boss and get demoted
Fuck with the boss and get promoted
We just some hooligans, we just some savages
Who living lavish, no, I'm not average
How you gon' win if you never stacking?
How you gon' win if you always losing?
He tried to rob me, I had to shoot him
BC the army and we recruiting
BC the army and we recruiting
BC the army, we might recruit you
You won't believe it
Every week I gotta fly to Phoenix, then I repeat it
I told my nigga hold the bale
Then he reminded me, I told him keep it
He told me take it back, boy, I don't need it
Why would you try me up like I'm not eatin'?
We both BC, so we eat the same
This shit is more than letters on a chain

[Chorus]
I get that check and I stack it
My money blue like it's Crippin'
Sell you a brick and I'm dippin'
Weigh that shit up in an updated kitchen
Fuck that lil' bitch on an island inside of the kitchen
I ride with dead people, I'm superstitious
She give me head on her knees, she religious
No, I'm not Thug, but I ran up them digits by using my digits
They wanna fuck with the kid like I'm Billy
They wanna fuck with the kid like I'm Sy Ari
These the Moon Rocks, you not high as me
You not 'bout that life, don't you lie to me
Just like a horse, she gon' ride me
BC a secret society
Draco for niggas who trying me
Draco for niggas who trying me

[Verse 2]
Look what I did
They wanna fuck with the kid
That's just the way that I live
That's just the way that I operate
You can get shot or cooperate
Ran up the bag, filled up a duffel
Fuck all these niggas, no, I can't trust 'em
We just be hustling
I live the life of a G, I'm accustomed
He run off with a pack, then I'ma bust him
Money Man Chapo, I trap in the gutter
Money Man Chapo, I knock off your brother
Chop up a brick in a gourmet kitchen
Just hit a dime in a gourmet kitchen
I am a boss, look how I'm living
Every strap on me, clip got inches
Every strap on me got extensions
No, I'm not Thug, but I ran up them digits
I call up bro and he sendin' the shipment
I want lil' mama mouth like a dentist
I had to flood that Black Circle pendant
I'm sellin' packs just to feed my dependents
Fuck her so good, I might break her appendix
BC the circle, our spirits is kindred
BC the circle, our spirits is kindred

[Chorus]
I get that check and I stack it
My money blue like it's Crippin'
Sell you a brick and I'm dippin'
Weigh that shit up in an updated kitchen
Fuck that lil' bitch on an island inside of the kitchen
I ride with dead people, I'm superstitious
She give me head on her knees, she religious
No, I'm not Thug, but I ran up them digits by using my digits
They wanna fuck with the kid like I'm Billy
They wanna fuck with the kid like I'm Sy Ari
These the Moon Rocks, you not high as me
You not 'bout that life, don't you lie to me
Just like a horse, she gon' ride me
BC a secret society
Draco for niggas who trying me
Draco for niggas who trying me
