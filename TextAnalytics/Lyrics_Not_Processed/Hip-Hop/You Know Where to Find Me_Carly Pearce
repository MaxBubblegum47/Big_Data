[Verse 1]
Down that no name county road, past where the cigarettes grow
And city dreams start turning into dirt
Underneath the sky so black, backseat of your Pontiac
Got me breathing secrets no one's ever heard

[Chorus]
When I'm feeling lost, when I'm feeling weak
You know how to bring me back to what I really need
That little bit of wild that no one ever sees
When I'm on the edge of losing who I wanna be
You know where to find me, find me
You know where to find me, find me

[Verse 2]
When I don't know where to go and life feels a lot like a tornado
Spinning me around without a place to land, oh-oh
There in chaos, we lock eyes, you always show up right on time
Swear you calm the storm at the touch of your hand

[Chorus]
When I'm feeling lost, when I'm feeling weak
You know how to bring me back to what I really need
That little bit of wild that no one ever sees
When I'm on the edge of losing who I wanna be
You know where to find me, find me
You know where to find me, find me

[Bridge]
I'm never too far gone for you
I'm never too far gone
No matter where I go, it's true
I'm never too far gone

[Chorus]
When I'm feeling lost, when I'm feeling weak
You know how to bring me back to what I really need
That little bit of wild that no one ever sees
When I'm on the edge of losing who I wanna be
You know where to find me, find me
You know where to find me, find me, yeah
You know where to find me, find me
You know where to find me, find me, yeah
