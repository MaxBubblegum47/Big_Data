[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah
Nah, man, you gotta be kiddin' me, man, c'mon
You cheat me, you cheat yourself, alright? (Yeah)
Straight up

[Chorus: Big Sean & 
Travis Scott
]
Signal goin' in and out (Prr), swimmin' at the house (Wait)
Live with no doubts (Woah), zen the fuck out (
Yeah
)
Big dawg plays (Big), the pay offs in route (Swerve)
Laid across the couch (Wow), I'm zen the fuck out (
It's lit
)
Zen the fuck out (Prr), zen the fuck out (Wait)
Laid across the couch (Couch), I'm zen the fuck out (
Yeah
)

[Verse: Big Sean & 
Travis Scott
]
Hol' up, I'm losin' my mind 'cause people keep talkin'
Niggas be lyin', bitches be cryin'
I be like "God, please, slow down, one at a time" (God, 
let's go
)
And they all want dibs and they want percents
They comin' at you and they comin' at them
But they not ever comin' for mine, no
I can't invite you random hoes to my house 'cause your energy is too whack
I can't waste the sex on you (Woah, woah) and give you everything you can't give me back (
Straight up
)
If we don't have the same vision, then we can't exchange contacts (Brr)
I don't get mad, I don't react, I just relax (Relax, 
yeah
)
Good vibes or no vibes, my vibes
I cut the cords, no hooks, no sides (Woah)
Yeah, no road blocks, kill that off road side
I'm more like coach, how I motivate mine (Coach)
You more like ref how you play both sides
Can't sit around, let the day go by
Can't sit around, let opps take your spot
Eat your food, fuck your wife
Look down and say fuck your life
Have you been down? You stayed up all night? (Woah)
Sleep deprived, but wake up alright
Fuck it, you gotta be tired (Tired)
I done survived things I shouldn't survive
So, what? That gotta be God (My God)
Top five, number one, quit tryna even the odds

[Chorus: Big Sean & 
Travis Scott
]
Signal goin' in and out (Prr), swimmin' at the house (Wait)
Live with no doubts (Wow), zen the fuck out (
Yeah
)
Big dawg plays (Big), the pay offs in route (Swerve)
Laid across the couch (Wow), I'm zen the fuck out (
It's lit
)
Signal goin' in and out (Prr), swimmin' at the house (Wait)
Live with no doubts (Wow), zen the fuck out (
Yeah
)
Big dawg plays (Big), the pay offs in route (Swerve)
Laid across the couch (Wow), I'm zen the fuck out
Zen the fuck out (Prr), zen the fuck out (Wait, 
let's go
)
Laid across the couch (Couch), I'm zen the fuck out (Zen)
Zen the fuck out, zen the fuck out (Swerve)
Laid across the couch (Couch), I'm zen the fuck out

[Outro: Big Sean]
You either in or you out (Out)
You either sure or you doubt (Doubt)
They'll be bringin' all that fucked up energy 'round through to my house
This shit's a meditation, medicate on dedication
Atop my reservation
