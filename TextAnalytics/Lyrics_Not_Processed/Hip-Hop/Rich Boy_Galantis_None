[Chorus]
I don't need a rich boy
I don't want your money
No, you don't gotta spend nothing on me
All I want is sweet, sweet love, sweet, sweet love 
(hey!)
I don't need a rich boy
I don't want dollars
No, you don't gotta be a high roller
All I want is sweet, sweet love, is sweet, sweet love 
(hey!)

All I want is sweet, sweet love
I don't need a rich boy

No, you don't gotta be a high roller
All I want is sweet, sweet love, is sweet, sweet love
