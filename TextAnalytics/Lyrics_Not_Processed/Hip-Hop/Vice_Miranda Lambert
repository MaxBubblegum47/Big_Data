[Intro]
Sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
33, 45, 78
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice

[Verse 1]
All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's gone before it ever melts the ice
Another vice

[Chorus 1]
Another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh

[Verse 2]
I wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice

[Chorus 2]
Another town, where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mmm, another vice

[Verse 3]
Standing at the sink, not looking at the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

[Outro]
Mmm another vice
Yes, another vice
Ooh, another vice
Another vice
Another vice
Another vice
