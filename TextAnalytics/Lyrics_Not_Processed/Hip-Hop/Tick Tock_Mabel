[Intro: Mabel]
Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock

[Verse 1: Mabel]
I don't need no other, I'm satisfied
Doing it on my own
Only takes one lover to change your vibe
Ain't that the way it go?
I don't need nobody, but you're on replay
Caught in the memory
When you touch my body and you say my name
Giving me what I need
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

[Pre-Chorus: Mabel]
Every minute, so lost in it
Like you're in my bed
Every hour, give you power
I'm losing mine instead
(Tick tock, tick tock)

[Chorus: Mabel]
24/7, got you on my mind
Think about you all the time
My body wants you night and day
But my head is screaming, "Go away"
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
24/7, got you on my mind
Darling, I don't have the time
My body wants you night and day
I'm losing all control of me

[Post-Chorus: Mabel]
Na na, na na na
(Tick tock)
Na na, na na na na na
Na na, na na na na na
(Tick tock)
Na na na na na na na

[Verse 2: 24kGoldn]
Hey!
24/7 I got a place with your name on it
Just in case you decided you're coming out, mmh
No time for thinking, too busy dancing and drinking
Know you been meaning to gеt up out of the house, mmh
Baby, throw that Fendi on the floor
Addicted to your loving, need some more
Heard you want my body, I want yours
You already know that I already know

[Chorus: Mabel, 24kGoldn]
24/7, got you on my mind
Think about you all the time
My body wants you night and day (And day)
But my head is screaming, "Go away" (Away)
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick)
24/7, got you on my mind
Darling, I don't have the time
My body wants you night and day (And day)
I'm losing all control of me (Of me)

[Post-Chorus: Mabel, 24kGoldn]
Na na, na na na
(Na na)
Na na, na na na na na
Na na, na na na na na
(Yeah yeah)
Na na na na na na na

[Bridge: Mabel, 24kGoldn]
Every minute, so lost in it
Like you're in my bed
Every hour, give you power
I'm losing mine instead
Tick tock, mhm
Tick tock, tick tock, mhm
Tick tock, yeah
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

[Chorus: Mabel]
24/7, got you on my mind
Think about you all the time
My body wants you night and day (Day, day)
But my head is screaming, "Go away" (Go away, go away now, now)
24/7, got you on my mind (My mind, yeah)
Darling, I don't have the time
My body wants you night and day (And day)
I'm losing all control of me, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Mabel]
Na na, na na na
(Tick tock)
Na na, na na na na na
(Tick tock)
Na na, na na na na na
(Tick tock)
Na na na na na na na
(You got me losing all control of me)
Na na, na na na
(Tick tock)
Na na, na na na na na
Na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Tick tock, yeah
