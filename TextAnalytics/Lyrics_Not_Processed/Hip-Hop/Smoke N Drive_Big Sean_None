[Hook:]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn my music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

[Verse 1:]
All black car (car)
Three percent tint
I can clearly see out
But you can barely see in
The end and on the end
We blowing Indonesia
And I'mma let it hit til I get amnesia
I'm crazy the haze got me hazy I'm lazy
Tell Ben that it something about Mary and clearly (what)
I'm so outta here you can say a nigga spacey (damn)
Pocket full of papers so I'm finnin to get some papers (yeah)
Bout to inhale like I'm finnin to see Satan (what)
Bout to exhale like I'm finnin to see my savior
So get the leaves and trees like it's autumn
Have them windows all rolled up rolled em and told em man

[Hook:]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn the music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive
