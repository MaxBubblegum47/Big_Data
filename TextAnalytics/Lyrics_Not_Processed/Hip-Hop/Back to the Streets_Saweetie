[Chorus: Saweetie]
Pull up in my hood best dressed
Next thing, upgrade, who's next?
Rich boy, got him on deck
Good boy, tell that nigga "fetch"
I put my new man on a leash
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease
I ride around town 'til I leave
I gave the boy a round, spit him back to the street
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da, yeah
I spit him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Back to the streets

[Verse 1: Saweetie]
So clean when I pull up to the scene
Big goals, and I put that on me
What you thinkin'? What's good?
Fuck how you feel and I wish a nigga would
Had to hit the Heisman on ya homies
Steppin' in here, bad bitches only
My ex used to act like he owned me
Ain't enough just to treat me like a trophy
I had that, passed that, knew I had to trash that
Bounced on his ass, turned that boy into a flashback
I'm a five-star bitch with a price tag
Gotta find me somebody that could match that
The last one got on my last nerve
Made me go change my passwords
I hit the curve with that swerve
You know I get the last word

[Chorus: Saweetie & 
Jhené Aiko
]
Pull up in my hood best dressed
Next thing, upgrade, who's next?
Rich boy, got him on deck
Good boy, tell that nigga "fetch"
I put my new man on a leash
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease
I ride around town 'til I leave
I gave the boy a round, spit him back to the street
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da, yeah
I spit him back to the streets
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da (
Yeah
)
Back to the streets

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
Back to the streets, send you back to your old hood
On hood, baby, this is for your own good
I'm a player-ass bitch and you knew it
Had a good time, now I'm ready for some new dick (Haha)
Pass it to Saweetie, now you hit it
Through with it, there ain't really nothin' else to do with it
Yeah, you know I leveled up
I can't be stuck, I wish you luck, though
Consider yourself blessed
You got to fuck with the baddest
You know that I can't be kept
No, I gotta dip out

[Chorus: Saweetie, 
Jhené Aiko
 & 
Saweetie & Jhené Aiko

Pull up in my hood 
best dressed
Next thing, upgrade, 
who's next?
Rich boy, got him on deck
Good boy
, tell that nigga "fetch" (
Yeah
)
I put my new man on a leash (
On a leash
)
Traded in my old nigga, he was just a lease (
Ooh
)
I ride around town 'til I leave (
'Til I leave, oh
)
I gave the boy a round, spit him 
back to the street
Like la-da-dee-da-dee-da, yeah
I spit him 
back to the streets
Like 
la-da-dee-da-dee-da
Back to the streets

[Outro: Saweetie]
La-da-dee-da-dee-da
Back to the streets
Back, back to the streets
La-da-dee-da-dee-da, yeah
Back to the streets
Put my new man on a leash
He was just a lease
Ride around town 'til I leave
