[Chorus: Young Thug & 
Rich Homie Quan
]
(
Ooh
) I'ma pull up, eat on that pussy and dip (And what?)
(
Ayy
) I'ma keep one inside the chamber like Wilt (Gah gah)
(
Ooh
) Baby girl spoiled and she spoileder than milk
(
Ayy
) And keep her on my side like a fuckin' hip (Hey)
She gon' make sure I survive, she gon' do it well
(
Ooh
) Baby I just want them thighs right under that belt
(
Ayy
) She just want me to keep them lies all to myself
(
Ooh
) Word, she gon' help me like she's Santa's elves (Woo!)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
She gon' look over these bitches like terms and conditions (And what?)
I'ma move her out the trenches and buy her a Bentley (And what?)
I'ma fuck her then hold on to her like she gon' miss me (And what?)
I'ma pull on that wavy hair 'cause it's Indian Remy (Swoo)
I grab the key, she wanna ride with me (Skrrt)
She tied the knot so she can die with me (And what?)
She say she can do the same thing as 5 bitches (So what you do?)
So I went and fired them 5 bitches (Damn)
She the B-E-S-T, best (She the best, she the best)
She ride me, 200 on that pussy like a T-Rex (Better than the rest)
I won't stop lovin' her, no way (Ayy)
No way, I'ma invest (Swear for God, I'ma invest)
In her

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I had to hit her from the back then dip up out it (Hey)
I don't know what it is but it's somethin' about her (Ooh)
When she around she do somethin' to me, I can't doubt it (Ayy)
I don't know what it is, but it's some' 'bout her
Shawty got me fucked up, blowin' O's, no Audi (Skrrt)
Her ex nigga, he fucked up and I don't give no fuck about him (Nah)
But I'll do whatever when it come down to shawty (Yeah)
The feds askin' questions, I don't know shit about it
Somethin' 'bout lil' shawty that I can't put my finger on (Ayy)
It's somethin' 'bout lil' shawty, she rather text, she don't be on phones (Nope)
It's somethin' 'bout lil' shawty, say it, that got Rich Homie gone (Hahaha)
Shawty the best in my eyes and I know (I do)
She don't do fashion and she don't even go outdoors (Nuh-uh)
Before she was ready you already knew I know (I swear)
Shawty made me sick, I'm feelin' like I got a cold
Can't forget about my bro

Ayy

She got my life, I don't want no one to rob her (Don't take it)
Not Young Scooter but all she know is count up
 (She counting)
Ayy, I'm on her front end like a fuckin' blouse (Big B)
I'm on her head like a fuckin' bounty
