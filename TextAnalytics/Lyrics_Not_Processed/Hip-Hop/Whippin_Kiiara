[Intro]
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin', whippin'
Whippin'

[Verse 1]
Don't hit me past one 'cause I might come
Pop a yellow bus, now I'm goin' dumb (Yee)
If it's past two, I can't look at you (Fuck it)
But I will 'cause you're too true
Too real, fuck the world, that's how you make me puke
No-no-no, hey, I still fuck with you
It's good luck when I'm like, "Girl, what's up with you?"
Wrist, wrist, wrist, whippin' in the car with you

[Chorus]
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Wh-whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin' in the car with you
Whippin' in the car with you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you

[Verse 2]
Phone lit, past three, see you say what's up
Fuckboy, thought I told you not to hit me up
I got a problem and it sucks, boy
O.T., I'm in love with the fuckboys
I'm just bein' real, can I keep it real?
Way too many feels, way too many feels
Chanel bag, cop it, I don't fuckin' want it
I don't need that bullshit in your wallet

[Chorus]
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin', whippin'
Whippin' in the car with you
Whippin' in the car with you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin', whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin', whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
Whippin', whippin' in the car with you, you, you

[Outro]
Whippin' in the car with you, you, you
You, you, you, you
