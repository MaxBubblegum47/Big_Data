[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
I take a sniff of her
She one hell of a drug
And if it's no shame
I'm one hell of a love
You knew exactly what you do, hurt you do if you abuse it, you'll be eleven o'clock on news
She can be used and it'll get me up and move
But if I love her, nothing above her makes my music better in tune
It's like when I lose it, she's in use and I can use her
Seducin' us, confusin', it's in blood, me body move her
She smells me, have this perfume, nobody tells me
What I can do, sizzlin' lovely
Like I'm gonna feel, give me some bubbly
That's how I do, That's how I do

[Chorus: Jesse Rankins]
Oh, I need your love
Your cocaine love
'Till I feel it in my bloodstream
Your cocaine love

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Say man, I asked her if she do it like it's really nothing to it
A deeper type of love so you gotta be true to it
She's my shotgun soldier, hold me down on the highway
Hit the interstate on the regular going my way
Pretty when she's dry but when wet she's it's even better
Put her in your life, I swear that you'll never forget her
Swear that you'll never regret her, but she's cold so bring you a sweater
She grab a hold, you better keep it together
She'll have a motherfucker feelin' like a million bucks
But she'll leave you high and dry
She couldn't give a million fucks
Now you recognize you lookin' at yourself
And I sit back laughing cause I'm the bitches pimp

[Chorus: Jesse Rankins]
Oh, I need your love
Your cocaine love
'Till I feel it in my bloodstream
Your cocaine love

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
It's the most potent love I ever had
It's like a different dope I never had
She like two daily doses of whatever's bad
And make me feel so good, I ain't never mad
Oh please, oh please, can I get just one mo hit, huh?!
I don't mean to be greedy but I need me just one mo fix, ma!
I think I'm addicted cause dog I forever be in it, a fiend to the finish
This shit is ridiculous, I'm sick with it, I need intervention, detox
To claim myself what she got is something else, I relapse
It just keeps calling me back no matter how hard I try
These things, ya'll got all ya'll offtrack but I need more
I'm coming back, I'm running back

[Chorus: Jesse Rankins]
Oh, I need your love
Your cocaine love
'Till I feel it in my bloodstream
Your cocaine love
