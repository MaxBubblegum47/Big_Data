[Intro: Mike Mike]
See I worship–
See I worship–
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind

[Verse 1: $WITCHBLADE $CRIM]
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Lucifer keep speakin' to me, triple six up on my time
Paranoid, anxiety, prescriptions always fill my mouth
Fuckboys keep on tryin' me
Now I'm bringing Satan out
Candle lit séances and black witches
Them demons come and posses me now
Devil laughs and black ski masks
I'm hearing footsteps through my house
Got that redrum in my mind
That murder, murder 'till they dead
AK-47 cocked and ready, filled to the top with lead
You can see it in my eyes when that devil shit takes over me
No remorse, them drugs I snort got falling angels controllin' me
(
See I worship—
)
Now I'm thinkin' $uicide, who am I?
Done sold my soul just for a hit
See I worship, see I worship...

[Chorus: Mike Mike]
Devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
See I worship

[Verse 2: YUNG PLAGUE]
It's the *59 $uicidal great white
Cruisin' a tidal wave on a late night
Lake-like white boy, yah
Refusing to loosen the noose
Bitch, I'm losing my mind
'Cause you losers choosing to abuse what I say in my lines
You need to get a life–matter fact, take mine
Make wine out of all the bullshit that you hear through the grapevine
What you heard?
That my flame shines way bright?
Bitch, I be that shark swimmin' in the dark
Never bark, bitch, you know I bite
Each tooth like a steak knife
Put this bitch in park
Here's the part when I spark up the blunt
The mark of the devil displayed on the front
Got a hunch you ain't coming out until the daytime
Evil Knievel
, bitch
I stunt like a fake spine
Bitch, I take mine
Souls and all I'm like a leech, bitch
The devil lay me down to sleep
My Chevrolet is gowned in sheep
Heading to hell, yeah the road is steep
If I had a soul, It was never mine to keep
(
See I worship—
)
Yung Plague, bitch
I was sent to preach
Fuck Πάτερ ἡμῶν ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς

[Chorus: Mike Mike]
See I worship–
See I worship–
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
See I worship

[Verse 3: RVMIRXZ]
Creepin' out the cut
This a cold-blooded killer
Not givin' a mother fuck, let me rep this shit
It's the six digit, children of the corn
Call me Malachai, got the spiritual powers
I'm taking over this bitch
I got the scythe on my hand
Take a life in my hand
The devil came out the flame and gave me the master plan
Knuckin' and buckin' and servin' the fiends
Stackin' my money and countin' my greens
Black on these busters, I'm takin' they neck
As I creep in the middle of the night with my TEC
Don't run your mouth, don't disrespect
Because I'll take a nigga's life with a motherfuckin' quickness
Yea, you know who it be
It be the wicked one from the West Coast
Got a double barrel shotgun, point it at your chest
Drink a nigga’s blood
Then I eat a nigga’s flesh because you already know
See I worship devil shit, therefore, them demons creep my mind
Angels try to speak to me but bein' Godly ain't my kind
(
See I worship—
)
Creepin' out the dungeon blowin' on that fuckin' indo
Blow a nigga's brain, triple six my nigga you should know

[Outro: Mike Mike]
See I worship–

Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my ain't my

Angels try to speak to me but being Godly ain't my kind
