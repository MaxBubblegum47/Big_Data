[Intro: K Camp & (Too $hort)]
It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
(Bitch you know me, it's daddy)
It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
(I brought you in this world, and bitch I'll take you out, it's nothin')
So what you sayin', ho? You know I'm the man, ho
Nothin', but a bird, I'ma leave you where you stand, ho
Heard you got a man ho, hope he understand though
You ain't nothin' but a creeper baby, I'm just sayin', though
Sayin' though, aye, it ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
(I cut a bitch off) It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
I had a super bad chick, she kept runnin' her mouth
Kept talkin' all bitch, so I cut that bitch off
Fire, ho, these hoes know I'm the man when I walk through
Alex just paid me 80 grand for a walkthrough
30 chains on, Boosie keep these hoes lookin'
I could have the whole strip club, so I don't need your pussy
My exes talkin' 'bout when 
I was young and moved that dope
They ain't got me no more, you a woulda coulda shoulda ass ho
I'm so hot, so hot, you know, since I've been home they call me hot sauce
Straight goon, it ain't nothin' to get you knocked off
Foreign with the top off, runnin' since I got out
I can't get that fire head, I'ma cut your ass off
Period, you say I ain't the man then you're delirious
"Boosie, you just gon' cut me off?" I told you I was serious
Told you take the shot, girl, so you can't have no period
But you ain't listen, it's consequences - bye, ho!

[Chorus: K Camp]
It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
So what you sayin', ho? You know I'm the man, ho
So what you sayin', ho? You know I'm the man, ho

[Verse 2: YG]
Bitch I'm from West Side, Tree Top Bompton
You ain't shit, actin' like you faithful but you're everybody's bitch
Everybody done hit, everybody did somethin'
Your ass butt naked, that's why I cut you off
I know the situation, I don't need no explanations
Lyin' to me like I was slow, bitch this ain't The Matrix
I got the naked pictures, yeah the ones you sent to everybody
You was hoin' so much, a nigga couldn't care about you

[Verse 3: K Camp]
You thought I was playin' when I cut that bitch off
I'm just tryna get inside that hole like you're golf
Oh that girl too nasty, she gon' suck it 'til it's soft
Runnin' 'round with balls, woulda thought this was lacrosse
You can't tell me ain't the hottest in your city, that I know
I see these niggas hatin' but they love it on the low
Every city that I hit, them bitches, they're in the front row
I asked myself "Why he mad", but I found out that's his ho, that I know

[Chorus: K Camp & 
Too $hort
]
It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
 (
Real playas represent, yeah mane, you know
)
It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
 (
It's like that sometimes
)
So what you sayin', ho? You know I'm the man, ho
 (
Look, it's over, yeah it's nothin' to me
)
So what you sayin', ho? You know I'm the man, ho
 (
I fucked with you, and you fucked it all, so it's over, bitch
)

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
(It's ya boy Juicy J, let's get it!)
If she ain't making money, homie, it don't make sense
Juicy J, quick to cut her off, treat her like Sprint
Take her out, of the game
Bring her friend, off the bitch
I'm a player and the coach
I be balling out the gym
I'm so high above the rim
They all that, catch me on film
Say she just wanna kick it
Til I kicked her out my Benz
Hoe, I'm in the... Hall of Fame, 20 years and running
And my dough ain't... running out, marathon money
I bet she would run a marathon for me
Do whatever for the Benz, lick me like a sundae
She in church on Sunday; in the club Sunday night
Watch me cut this chick off; I won't even need a knife
