[Verse 1]
Are you one of them girls that peels off the Bud Light label? Just might run a pool table?
Roll your eyes if I call you an angel, ain't you one of them girls?
Ask you to dance, you say "No" just to see how far I'll go
Your song comes on and your eyes close, that's when I know, yeah
You got your heart on lock down, got a wall I gotta knock down
Kinda wanna do a shot now, come on now

[Chorus]
And you're one of them girls that ain't tryna meet nobody
You're just here for the party, if I'm wrong then stop me, yeah
You're one of them girls that ain't handin' out your number
You like to make us want you, you like to make us wonder

[Verse 2]
If you're one of them girls, 'cause I'm one of them boys
Would trade his whole world, hm, yeah
For one of them girls who likes to act all quiet, sexy, not even tryin'
Yeah, you know I ain't lyin', damn right
You one of them girls, broke every heart in your hometown
On the day you rode out, got 'em all wishin' on stars now

[Chorus]
If I find one of them girls that ain't tryna meet nobody
You're just here for the party, if I'm wrong then stop me, yeah
You're one of them girls that ain't handin' out your number
You like to make us want you, you like to make us wonder

[Post-Chorus]
If you're one of them girls
Well, I'm one of them boys
Would trade his whole world, hm, yeah
For one of them girls

[Bridge]
You're one of them girls
I wanna put my lips on
Hold all night long
Write a little love song

[Chorus]
For one of them girls that ain't tryna meet nobody
You're just here for the party, if I'm wrong then stop me, yeah
You're one of them girls that ain't handin' out your number
You like to make us want you, you like to make us wonder

[Post-Chorus]
If you're one of them girls
Well, I'm one of them boys
Would trade his whole world, his whole world
For one of them girls

[Outro]
Hmm, one of them girls
