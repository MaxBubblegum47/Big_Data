[Intro]
Walk like him
Walk like him
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Mama says I walk like him, feet at 10 and two
My uncle says I talk like him, I get my point across the room
And if he were here today, he'd just laugh out loud when they say
'Cause he knew that his boy was just like him

[Chorus 1]
So I cuss a little bit when the game's on TV
Got Eagles in the truck on repeat
Know how to use a hammer and nail
Don't whine about my problems
He was better at puttin' that bottle down
But I spend every day tryna make him proud
If I said that I didn't, I'd be lying
But I'm tryin' to walk like him

[Verse 2]
Papa said I'm stubborn like him, and I guess that he would know
My daddy got it from him, and I make three in a row
Well, ain't that how it goes? A bloodline keeping him alive
One day, my babies'll look at me and see what he was like

[Chorus 1]
So I cuss a little bit when the game's on TV
Got Eagles in the truck on repeat
Know how to use a hammer and nail
Don't whine about my problems
He was better at puttin' that bottle down
But I spend every day tryna make him proud
If I said that I didn't, I'd be lying
But I'm tryin' to walk like him
Oh, walk like him (Walk like him)

[Bridge]
I remember when he sat me down and told me he was sick
Said, "Son, don't worry 'bout me, you've got your life to live"
He started talking to God again
It'd been a while, like old friends
And when the time came for him, I know where he went

[Chorus 2]
So I pray a little more today than I used to
Call Mama every day like he said to
Know how to treat a woman right and how to live a life
He was better at puttin' that bottle down
But I spend every day tryna make him proud
If I said that I didn't, I'd be lying
But I'll keep tryin' to walk like him
Oh, walk like him, yeah (Walk like him)

[Outro]
Mama says I walk like him, feet at 10 and two
