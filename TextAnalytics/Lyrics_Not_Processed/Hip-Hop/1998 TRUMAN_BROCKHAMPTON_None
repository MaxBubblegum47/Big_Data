[Intro: Jim Jones]
"
You’re not free with your Cadillac! You’re doing just exactly what the Man wants you to do: Buy his goods, so you’ll never have any real economic f
reedom. He wants you to buy everythi
ng he advertises on TV, so he’ll keep you perpetually owing your soul to the company store. You’re not free, you’re a slave—!
"

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz

[Verse 1: Joba]
What's with these superficial people from my past?
Dancin' 'round the fact that I did everything the motherfuckers bet against
They be like, "Gather 'round, place your bets!
This young man won't ever be shit!"
Well my bad, I guess I just pursued this shit
While you chose to settle down to have some kids
I mean, it's okay to fall in line, just don't look back
That's a long ass line that I'm not in
I just never found the time, or had the chance
Truth is, you can kiss my ass
Never been the one to bow down
Never been the one to air out any situation, but right now
When it's all your fault, I'm here now

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Thrift like a five hundred discount
I move it, I move it like Madagascar
Flip it like eight ball to inside of nose, it get raw
Bloody leaf color like fall
When you were calling, they said I'll be nothing
Well, suck on my dick and then lick on my balls
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Th—th—they want to boot up my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
Look what we did in a year
You need a neutral career
I hate on myself when I look in the mirror
Piddling voices all up in my ear
Why do I care how I look?
Why do I care what they say?
I do not care what they say! (Rrrah!)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk (niggas talk too much!)
They forgot how to listen (listen!)
'Til the prophets arisen
We mix New Edition with nuclear fission
I don't do auditions, I don't ask permission
Ain't no politician, don't ask my opinion
You got an addiction to what ain't your business
Make the admission, 
I make like magicians and hit my Houdini
Why they so soft like linguine? I murder this music routinely
I know that you see me, don't see you searching the meaning
I think that’s why you won't believe and the future is leaning
Revolutions started streaming
The reason why you see me beaming
I'm dreaming of making moves like the government
You better think about who you fucking with, get back!

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't

[Bridge: bearface & dijon]
(Freak, ah, ah) Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (Free, free)
Oh yeah (Yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah (Yeah)

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
And if I could erase who you thought I was
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
And if I could erase who you thought I was
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
