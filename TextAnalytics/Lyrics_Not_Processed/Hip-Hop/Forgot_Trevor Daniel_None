[Intro]
Must've slipped your mind
Must've slipped your mind
Must've slipped your mind

[Verse 1]
I'm fine now that I'm without you
You burned me down, played me for a fool
Now you hit my line like everything is cool

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Baby, I don't got the time to remind you
That you'll never find no one as good as I was
Putting me through hell, you threw me in the fire
Must have slipped your mind, that I said "I'm done with you"

[Chorus]
You must have forgot that I don't need you no more
Must have forgot that I caught you creeping on the low
Must have forgot that I'm better since I moved on
You must have forgot that I don't need you no more
Must have forgot that I caught you creeping on the low
Must have forgot that I'm better since I moved on

[Verse 2]
You must not remember (No)
You threw me in the fire (No)
Just to watch me burn (No)
Still think I should put you first (Must've slipped your mind)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I don't got the time to remind you
That you'll never find no one as good as I was
Putting me through hell, you threw me in the fire
Must have slipped your mind, that I said "I'm done with you"

[Interlude]
(No, no, oh-oh)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(No, no, oh-oh)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(No, no, oh-oh)
Must've slipped your mind

[Chorus]
You must have forgot that I don't need you no more
Must have forgot that I caught you creeping on the low
Must have forgot that I'm better since I moved on
You must have forgot that I don't need you no more
Must have forgot that I caught you creeping on the low
Must have forgot that I'm better since I moved on

[Outro]
(No, no, no, nooo
No, no, no, nooo
No, no, no, nooo)
