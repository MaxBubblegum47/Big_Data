[Intro]
(Trauma Tone)
(Progression Music)

[Chorus]
I had to boss up for a check
I had to step on these niggas' neck
I had to go and get a couple stripes
I had to trap all day and night
I remember them cold nights
I hit her like I just got out the pen'
I buy a brick, then I go get it in
I'm a boss, I can override you
Come here, girl, let me get inside you
Come here, girl, let me jump behind it
Play with me and I'ma come and find you
I had to go and get a couple stripes
I had to trap all day and night
I had to boss up for a check
I had to step on these niggas' neck

[Verse 1]
I had to boss up for a check
I had to shoot a nigga for respect
I had to step on these niggas' necks
Just to show these niggas I got next
I went and put that gold on my neck
I had to show these hoes what they were missin'
Bought Giuseppe, nigga, just to kick it
Bought a hundred pounds, then I flipped 'em
Poured the eight and then I start sippin'
Took a whole P and started burnin'
Took a whole brick and then I served it
I started off with a plan
Then turned myself to the man
Really, I ain't have a helpin' hand
Just blew your favorite rapper advance
Just had to choke a little nigga out
'Cause the little nigga ran his mouth
Just had to spray up a nigga house
'Cause he ran off with an ounce
I'm a plug, nigga, I'm a grower
R.I.P. to my nigga Sosa
Fuck these niggas who hatin' on me
This mixtape for real niggas only, BC

[Chorus]
I had to boss up for a check
I had to step on these niggas' neck
I had to go and get a couple stripes
I had to trap all day and night
I remember them cold nights
I hit her like I just got out the pen'
I buy a brick, then I go get it in
I'm a boss, I can override you
Come here, girl, let me get inside you
Come here, girl, let me jump behind it
Play with me and I'ma come and find you
I had to go and get a couple stripes
I had to trap all day and night
I had to boss up for a check
I had to step on these niggas' neck

[Verse 2]
I had to show these niggas I'm the truth
I had to transform to a wolf
I had to go and get a couple stripes
I had to go and splurge on ice
I remember them cold nights
I was trappin' hard, selling white
Swipin', swipin', yeah, it changed my life
Come here, girl, I can change your life
Come here, girl, come and fuck a boss
Had to cut these lame niggas off
Got a a thousand P's in the loft
Had to shoot it out with the neighbors
'Cause them lil' niggas owed me paper
I don't owe nan' nigga no favor
I got like eighty rounds for the takers
I had to muscle up in these streets
I had to sell a brick just to eat
I had to knock out a nigga teeth
I had to work hard, no sleep
Niggas tried to come and cast doubt
'Til they seen a nigga cash out
Niggas thought I wouldn't make it out
I live the life niggas rap about

[Chorus]
I had to boss up for a check
I had to step on these niggas' neck
I had to go and get a couple stripes
I had to trap all day and night
I remember them cold nights
I hit her like I just got out the pen'
I buy a brick, then I go get it in
I'm a boss, I can override you
Come here, girl, let me get inside you
Come here, girl, let me jump behind it
Play with me and I'ma come and find you
I had to go and get a couple stripes
I had to trap all day and night
I had to boss up for a check
I had to step on these niggas' neck
