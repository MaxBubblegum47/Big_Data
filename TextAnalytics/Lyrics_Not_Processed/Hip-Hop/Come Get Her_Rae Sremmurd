[Intro: Swae Lee]
Trippin'
Mike WiLL Made-It
Somebody come to the floor, it feels like we've met before

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chopped and screwed up
I'm a pothead, true enough
At your ex crib and you're boo'd up
Take it slow, baby, we in no rush
Hennessy or Don Q? that's a very hard choice
For the diamonds on my pinky, need a gang of cool points
And the drop head make 'em drop dead, yeah
Ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, yeah
Believe me, I'm outchea
You see me, in action
I've heard a lot, a lot about you
Passin' 'round blunts like a hot potato
And you dancin' on the table, gushin' like volcano

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper (Yeah, Slim Jxmmi)
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
You got girls in here? I'm recruitin'
And they fine, hop the line
I've been sippin' on Patr√≥n and wine
I'm just tryna have a good fuckin' time
I was chillin' with the open container
Grabbed her arm, told her not to be a stranger
I was blowin' on the dank with my niggas
I was lookin' for the girls who willin'
Baby girl, if you fuckin' with me, then we gettin' bands
If you smokin' with me, then we on dabs
I don't fuck with local hoes, I told you that
How you movin', you deserve a couple racks

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
Somebody come get her (Shit, shit), she's dancin' like a stripper (Hey!, Ayy, ayy, ayy, you better get your girl outta here, man)
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper (I thought she just wanted a picture, ayy)
Somebody come tip her (Don't try me like no lil' nigga now), she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor (SremmLife!)

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Hunnids on your face, baby girl
Come and do that little thing that you was doin'
Ayy, they was in this mothafucka trippin'
What the hell they think we was doin'?
It seems like we fuckin' in this club
Baby girl, what they think that we're doin'?
You gettin' on my nerves with them questions
Girl, you know I'm tryna start a little movement
I ain't got no business fuckin' with you
Out the blue, you actin' brand new
Washingtons mean nothing to you
Same way with us

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor
