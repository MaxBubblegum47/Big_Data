[Verse 1]
Nobody's ever called me shy before
Blame it all on the butterflies that you're giving me
This must be what nervous feels like
Whatcha thinking little miss talkative?
Keeping secrets behind the smile on your lips
I'm not a mind reader but I think you're reading mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatcha say we take a little trip to the liquid courage store?
Pick out a bottle, stir the conversation 'til it pours

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm afraid we're never gonna cut to the chase if we stay sober
So let's get drunk and tell each other all the things we hesitate to say sober

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm into you, you're into me
Why should we be intimidated?
It's obvious there's more to us than we're communicating
We coulda kissed at "Hello," I'm just saying

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatcha say we take a little trip to the liquid courage store?
Pick out a bottle, stir the conversation 'til it pours
(We shoulda kissed at "Hello")

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm afraid we're never gonna cut to the chase if we stay sober
So let's get drunk and tell each other all the things we hesitate to say sober

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm afraid we're never gonna cut to the chase if we stay sober
So let's get drunk and tell each other all the things we hesitate to say sober
