[Verse 1: 12tildee]
It took me some time I got over you
I told them I would be and I'm over here
Cookin', workin', doin' the hell I'm supposed to do
Makin' nothin' out of something, watch nigga show you
I be workin' hard cause a nigga gotta get money
Look at these blues and these commas
Lemme count on it, lemme count on, lemme count it
I'mma clock in and I'mma give it to you in the morning

[Hook: 12tildee]
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over

[Verse 2: Famous Dex]
Tell me sometimes I got over
Young nigga pull up in a Rover
'member last year ridin' 'round broke
Now this year I ridin' 'round with the money
You can't hide nothin' lil dummy
All these lil bitches want money
Put my dick right down in her tummy
Why you keep laughin'? nothin' funny
I can't trust on these hoes
I don't love on these hoes
Cool with my bros
Have to pour me a 4
Have to pour me a 4, whoa
And you know how that goes
Yeah, Dexter, yeah
What? oh

[Hook: 12tildee]
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
Took me some time I got over
