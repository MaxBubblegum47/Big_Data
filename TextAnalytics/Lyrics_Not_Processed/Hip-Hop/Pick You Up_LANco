[Verse 1]
I heard from a friend of a friend
That you been staying home a lot lately
Just thought you should know you're not alone
I've been driving myself crazy
Thinking about the good times
Back when you were all mine
We were flying so high
Nothing but a blue sky
And my passenger seat misses you with me

[Chorus]
I still got that '04 V6 and I ain't seeing anyone
I'll pick up the broken pieces
I can pick you up
I can pick you up

[Verse 2]
Don't you think by now
We should've found some way to be over eachother
Maybe our goodbye wasn't right
You and I ain't come and go lovers
Ain't no reason now for you to still be down
I'm on your side of town
Can you hear the sound of my engine running
Hey girl, I'm coming

[Chorus]
I still got that '04 V6 and I ain't seeing anyone
I'll pick up the broken pieces
I can pick you, I can pick you up
I dont remember where we lost it
But I miss when we were us
Let's pick up right where we left off
I can pick you, I can pick you up
Oh I can pick you up

[Bridge]
You could stay down or I'll pick you up
Shut the world out or I'll pick you up
Coming over now, gonna pick you up

[Chorus]
I still got that '04 V6 and I ain't seeing anyone
I'll pick up the broken pieces
I can pick you, I can pick you up
I dont remember where we lost it
But I miss when we were us
Let's pick up right where we left off
I can pick you, I can pick you up
I can pick you up
