[Intro]
Why switch like different seasons?
I give that shit a weekend
Hollywood don't need a reason
To make you think you look bigger than you are

[Chorus]
Mileage, politics and violence
At least somebody's drivin'
All you need to fall in love
Mileage, politics and violence
At least somebody's drivin'
All you need to fall in love

[Post-Chorus]
All you need to fall in love

[Bridge]
You won't find Heaven, not in these hills
Boy, you shouldn't be here
All you need to fall in love
You won't find Heaven, not in these hills
Boy, you shouldn't be here
All you need to fall in love

[Verse]
When she arrived, it was 2:10 at night
We had sex then you cried, was the best in your life
And the last time we spoke, if we shoot for July
You can still make your mind, but I can't save your life
Baby, sorry, but I rarely do this, you can't carry me through this
I just wanna shine like Barracuda's kid, do this shit for Mammy Sue
This shit ain't nothin' new, this, this I knew since I was a jit
Clean my room and pray for this
Eat my dinner, then go back to whatever finna make me rich
Whole lotta feelin' that you can't dismiss
I was somewhere stuck in a hotel room
We was serving to the kids, no waitresses
All this shit come back around
Homie, don't get too down
I got your back sometime
Ride 'til the wheels fall off
And if this shit don't sell
She said, "You'll still be my favorite"
And I wish I could save her, but
Do this shit for Mammy Sue, this shit ain't nothin' new, huh
Do this shit for Apollonia, bitch, I thought I told you, ayy

[Outro]
So I feel like dancing
You know, I am in a booth
Shaped like a U
