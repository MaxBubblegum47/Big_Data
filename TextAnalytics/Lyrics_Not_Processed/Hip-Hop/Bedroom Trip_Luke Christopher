[Hook: Luke Christopher]
On the vodka, vodka, take another sip
Lying in your bedroom, thinking you the shit
On the kush girl, kush girl, take another hit
Lying on the floor, just a rebel on your own
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
Lying on the floor, just a rebel on your own

[Verse 1: Luke Christopher]
I know girls like you, I know girls like you
Passive aggressive, mad at their ex's
In their own world like you
But some say love is overrated
Some say love is getting faded
I think love is finding that girl
That's gonna stick with me when the fame ends
Some say, people think it too much
But they ain't thinking enough
But she just wants a man that's lasting
I just need some damn attraction
We just need to set our boundaries
You right there, me right here
Used to be all in your ear
I could see us in a year

[Hook: Luke Christopher]
On the vodka, vodka, take another sip
Lying in your bedroom, thinking you the shit
On the kush girl, kush girl, take another hit
Lying on the floor, just a rebel on your own
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
Lying on the floor, just a rebel on your own

[Verse 2: Luke Christopher]
I know guys like me, ain't no guys like me
You know them cowards
Wannabe bouncers tryna take my ID
Well I say fuck 'em if they ain't with you
Let 'em try and reinvent you
Cause one day they gon' regret that shit
Like them flowers that I can't send you
Some say, people think it too much
But they ain't thinking enough
But she just wants a man that's lasting
I just need some midnight action
We just need to set our boundaries
You right there, me right here
Used to be all in your ear
I could see us in a year

[Hook: Luke Christopher]
On the vodka, vodka, take another sip
Lying in your bedroom, thinking you the shit
On the kush girl, kush girl, take another hit
Lying on the floor, just a rebel on your own
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
Lying on the floor, just a rebel on your own
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
On a bedroom, bedroom, bedroom trip
Lying on the floor, just a rebel on your own
