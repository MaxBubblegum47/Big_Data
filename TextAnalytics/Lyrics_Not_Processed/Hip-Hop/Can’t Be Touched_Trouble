[Intro]
In my trap house, man
I got this, y'all

[Chorus: Roy Jones Jr. (Ft. Mr. Magic & Trouble)]
Can't be touched
Can't be stopped
Can't be moved
Can't be rocked
Can't be shook
We hot
When will you niggas learn
Came to get crunk
Came to bring life
Came to get it started
Came to get it right
Turn down the music
Turn up my mics
When will you niggas learn

[Verse 1: Mr. Magic]
I mean what I speak
I do as I say
I hustle, I grind
Don't get in my way
I'm pimping my hoes
I'm checking my foes
I spit at the police and duck my P.O.'s
I ain't going to court
You can call a judge
Tell him kiss my ass
Cause I ain't gonna budge
And I ain't going back to lock up
You try and the Glock'll pop up
I ain't going back to court
And I'm never gonna stop the puffing
Not for nothing
The block they need me
The streets they need me
The club scene nigga
Is mine believe me
You don't believe me

[Chorus: Roy Jones Jr. (Ft. Mr. Magic & Trouble)]
Can't be touched
Can't be stopped
Can't be moved
Can't be rocked
Can't be shook
We hot
When will you niggas learn
Came to get crunk
Came to bring life
Came to get it started
Came to get it right
Turn down the music
Turn up my mics
When will you niggas learn

[Verse 2: Trouble]
Open your hearts for me
Look what I got for you
You in the presence of greatness
I'll make it hot for you
Pass the rock to me
Block and I'll run with it
Here for the game
And all the pussy that come with it
So full of focus
I'm insistent on keeping it going
The Franchise, I exist in a league of my own
Expect attention unfamiliar with being ignored
The truth back, came in, locking and closing the door
Brick wall in the road
I won't move
The King
I'm like Roy in the ring
I can't lose
Show the face of what compares to mine
You wanna war
Mother fucker I ain't hard to find
Now holla back, nigga

[Chorus: Roy Jones Jr. (Ft. Mr. Magic & Trouble)]
Can't be touched
Can't be stopped
Can't be moved
Can't be rocked
Can't be shook
We hot
When will you niggas learn
Came to get crunk
Came to bring life
Came to get it started
Came to get it right
Turn down the music
Turn up my mics
When will you niggas learn

[Verse 3: Roy Jones Jr.]
I move when my heart say move
Fierce like a lion
Got nothing to prove
Stubborn as a hot damn mule
God in my corner
Nigga can't lose
Trying to take me out my hot damn shoes
See how quick I jump up and give you bitches the blues
They gonna see you on the hot damn news
And I ainâ€™t leavin' nothin linking me to the crime
Not a print, not a hot damn clue
Beating these niggas down
Is what I came to do
And I ain't playing bout a hot damn rule
Shaking you niggas down
If you ain't paying your dues
We passing up yo block and ohh
My screws are loose
Don't call my hands
Cause you gonna make me act a hot damn fool
Dead discussion, you will not win
Cause I will not lose

[Chorus: Roy Jones Jr. (Ft. Mr. Magic & Trouble)]
Can't be touched
Can't be stopped
Can't be moved
Can't be rocked
Can't be shook
We hot
When will you niggas learn
Came to get crunk
Came to bring life
Came to get it started
Came to get it right
Turn down the music
Turn up my mics
When will you niggas learn
