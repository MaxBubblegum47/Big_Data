[Intro: Big Sean]
Perrier
, uh-huh
Eardrummers
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Chorus: Big Sean]
On the come up, on the come up
Sun up, bunch a young niggas on the come up
Come up, run up
All my young ones on the come up
Bunch of young niggas on the come up

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Look, all my niggas 'bout that action
Livin' the life we imagined
I cut off all my distractions, and started attackin'
Whole team gotta have it, loyalty is all I'm askin'
Wearin' diamond medallions (straight up)
My whole squad run the Atlas (look)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I feel like I was chose to
Take care of the ones I'm close to
Kitchen lookin' like Whole Foods
Got the fam' around like it's "Soul Food," damn
I do this here for the set
Working all year 'til we set
Quick to check a bitch, yeah I check her
Even though life's a game of chess
'Cause I'm living play-by-play, day-by-day
No time for her honestly
Unless her face lookin' like a young Sade
'Cause I gotta get it a hundred ways
What you know 'bout bein' down and out?
'Til niggas sayin' you the best man
Like your best friend walkin' down the aisle
When you make it, they gon' say
I owe you and all kind of vowels
When you makin' all kinda of thous
I just want the Presidential Rollie black face, Obama style
Then count the check up, E. Honda style
Boy, this the D where they be rockin' fur and crocodile
Take your risk every time you out the house
But it's all worth momma's smile
Yeah, it's all worth momma's smile

[Chorus: Big Sean]
On the come up, on the come up
Sun up, bunch a young niggas on the come up
Come up, run up
All my young ones on the come up
Bunch of young niggas on the come up (aye)

[Bridge: Big Sean]
All my niggas 'bout that action
Livin' the life we imagined
I cut off all my distractions, and started attackin'
Whole team gotta have it, loyalty is all I'm askin'
Wearin' diamond medallions (straight up)
My whole squad run the Atlas (look)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I was just on Jimmy Fallon
I just got back from the Islands
I took my daddy to Cancun
Then we went to the Bahamas
He had all they baby momma's
I had all they momma babies
Boy, I swear this life is crazy
Told that nigga sit back and be lazy, yeah
Don't worry, man, I got it, I got it, I got it
We buildin' from the ground up, it's in the block and
So the hood support us like I Mom and Pop'ed it
'Cause I bring it home like I just adopt it
5 to 10 for a lethal weapon
He ain't need that sentence, he just needs direction
No one ever told them boys to make it out of debt
You gon' need way more than street credit
I got redirected
Tryna take this lil' piece of success I got and make it bigger
You can tell I'm focused in my baby pictures
Not replyin' to texts, not even naked pictures
That's how real it gets
Whole team so hungry for the meals and shit that I can feel this shit
They askin' how we made it like the pyramids
It's like I'm livin' just to kill this shit

[Chorus: Big Sean]
On the come up, on the come up
Sun up, bunch a young niggas on the come up
Come up, run up
All my young ones on the come up
Bunch of young niggas on the come up (aye)

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Look, all my niggas 'bout that action
Livin' the life we imagined
I cut off all my distractions, and started attackin'
Whole team gotta have it, loyalty is all I'm askin'
Wearin' diamond medallions (straight up)
My whole squad run the Atlas (look)
