[Verse 1]
Okay I say that shit again, I said it once before
I just, I just, I just, I just want it all
I glist and shine with Miss Fine
Model chick, big behind
Bad enough to skip the line, but to me she just a nine
I hop up out that double O, you can call me Mr. Bond
Bitch I am a monster, I belong on District 9
Catch me in my office doin' business
The fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'
I get all the eyes when I step inside and
They all arise when I am arivin'
Bring out the Rozay and the Ciroc and
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran
I guess they on son cause my neck look like horizon
Just a million people behind me and I don't have Verizon
Man I'm chillin' wit my niggas, nigga
And a couple cool bitches
What the fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'
Me and my niggas, Say It Ain't Tone
Hundred pretty girlies singin' our song
Yeah I kick my feet up you can't say that I ain't home
And I be blowin' on that reefer you can't say that it ain't strong and
She just, she just, she just, she just want a long dick
I put it in her mouth and now that bitch look like a Conehead
When I'm done go ahead
What the fuck this is?
What the fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'

[Verse 2]
I hear, I hear, I hear man but that shit just don't compare
I tell you you the best, when I'm lookin' in the mirror
By the time y'all over here, I'm prolly over there
And by the time you ridin' what I'm ridin' on, I'm in the air
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy
My frequent flyer miles is in the thousies I'm outtie
Somewhere chillin' in Maui swimmin' with the scuba fishes
What the fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'
Nigga I be splargin
I beg my pardon
Cause y'all niggas is starvin'
Lookin for a bargain
Gone and roll that weed yeah I think it's time to spark it
Cause I be runnin' through them trees, niggas call me Tarzan
What you think we won't stop gone stop?
Silly ho I'm living out my dreams don't you dare hit that alarm clock
I'm laid up with yo' girlfriend you knockin' like what you doin' nigga?
I'm like fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'

[Outro]
I hit you with a AMC, my nigga that's a full clip
And you could be like me if you just quit with all the bullshit
