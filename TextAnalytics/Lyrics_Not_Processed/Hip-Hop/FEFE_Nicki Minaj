[Intro: 6ix9ine, Nicki Minaj & Baka]
It's fuckin' TR3YWAY!
King of New York, lookin' for the Queen
Uh, you got the right one, hmm
L-let these-l-let these b-b-bitches know, nigga
Queens, Brooklyn, brrr, ah!
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Pussy got that wet, wet, got that drip, drip
Got that super soaker, hit that
She a Fefe, her name Keke
She eat my dick like it's free, free
I don't even know like "Why I did that?"
I don't even know like "Why I hit that?"
All I know is that I just can't wife that
Talk to her nice so she won't fight back
Turn around and hit it from the back, back, back
Bend her down then I make it clap, clap, clap

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Draco got that kick-back when I blow that, they all do track
They don't shoot back, one shot, close range, red dot
Head tight, yeah, I did that, yeah, I live that
Call a Uber with my shooter, with a Ruger, we gon' do ya
Niggas say they killin' people, but I really fuckin' do it

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
He-he tryna 69 like Tekashi, call him papi
Word to A$AP, keep me Rocky, I'm from New York, so I'm cocky
Say he fuckin' with my posse, copped me Khlo√© like Kardashi'
Keep this pussy in Versace, said I'm pretty like Tinashe
Put-put it all up in his face, did I catch a case?
Pussy game just caught a body, but I never leave a trace
Face is pretty, ass for days, I get chips, I ask for Lay's
I just sit back and when he done, I be like, "Yo, how'd it taste?"
(Yo, how'd it taste?)

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, Draco got that kick-back
When it kick-back, you can't get yo shit back
In fact this that bitch that
"I hate small talk, I don't fuck with chit-chat"
AC just stopped workin'
So they hit me, told me bring my wrist back
Come through rockin' fashions
That got all these bitches like "Yo, what's that?"
(Like "Yo, what's that?")

[Chorus: 6ix9ine & Nicki Minaj]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Bridge: 6ix9ine & Nicki Minaj]
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
I catch a ho right by her toe
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki
Kick that ho right through the door (TR3YWAY)
I don't really want no friends, my old ho just bought this Benz
Nicki just hopped in this shit, now I won't see that bitch again
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe (no)
I catch a ho right by her toe (no)
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki
Kick that ho right through the door (no, TR3YWAY)

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & 6ix9ine]
Mmm, Young Money, Young Money bunny
Colorful hair, don't care
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no
Scum Gang!
