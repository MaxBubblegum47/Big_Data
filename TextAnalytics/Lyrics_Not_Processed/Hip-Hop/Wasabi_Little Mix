[Chorus: Jade]
Stick like toffee, sip like coffee
Wake up, change your mind and drop me
Love to hate me, crazy, shady
Spit me out like hot wasabi
Lick me up, I'm sweet and salty
Mix it up and down my body
Love to hate me, praise me, shame me
Either way, you talk about me

[Verse 1: Jesy & 
All
]
Oh-oh,
 I love the way you talk about me
Oh-oh,
 look at how far it got me
Oh-oh,
 the shit the papers write about me
Oh-oh,
 I fold it up like origami
Oh-oh,
 like, "She ain't wearing no clothes"
Oh-oh,
 "When she goin' solo?"
Oh-oh,
 "I bet they gonna break up"
Oh-oh,
 but what the hell do you know?

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne w/ All, 
Jesy Nelson
]
Ooh, baby, ooh (Yes, you)
I can feel you hatin' on me
Ooh, baby, ooh (Yeah, you)
I'm glad to be your inspiration
Who, baby, who's (Guess who)
The topic of your conversation, I am (I am)
All the ugly things you say
Come and say 'em to my face

[Chorus: Jade & 
All
]
Stick like toffee, sip like coffee
Wake up, change your mind and drop me
Love to hate me, crazy, shady
Spit me out like hot wasabi
Lick me up, I'm sweet and salty
Mix it up and down my body
Love to hate me, praise me, shame me
Either way, you talk about me

[Verse 2: Perrie & 
All
]
Oh-oh,
 watching me
Oh-oh,
 I ain't watching you (I'm watching you)
Oh-oh,
 what you see
Oh-oh,
 I hope you like the view (Check it out)
Oh-oh,
 best believe
Oh-oh,
 you'll never get into me
Oh-oh,
 all these words run through me (
Oh-oh,
)

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne w/ All & 
Jesy
]
Ooh, baby, ooh (Yes, you)
I can feel you hatin' on me
Ooh, baby, ooh (Yeah you)
I'm glad to be your inspiration
Who, baby, who's (Guess who)
The topic of your conversation, I am (I am)
All the ugly things you say
Come and say 'em to my face

[Chorus: Perrie & Jade]
Stick like toffee, sip like coffee
Wake up, change your mind and drop me
Love to hate me, crazy, shady
Spit me out like hot wasabi
Lick me up, I'm sweet and salty
Mix it up and down my body
Love to hate me, praise me, shame me
Either way, you talk about me

[Outro: Jesy]
You know I love the way you talk about me
Look at how far it got me
You make up shit to write about me
I fold it up like origami
Like, "She ain't wearing no clothes"
"When she goin' solo?"
"I bet they gonna break up"
But what the hell do you know?
 (Ah!)
