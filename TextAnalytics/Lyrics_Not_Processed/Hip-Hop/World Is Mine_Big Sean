[Intro: A$AP Ferg & 
Big Sean
]
Yeah
Better get the fuck out my face
You always tellin' me I got the world
Talkin' all that shit
Bitch you better the fuck out my face
But I don't have half of what I want to achieve
Na-na-na-na-na-na, fuck is you sayin'
I got to get it

[Chorus 1: Big Sean & A$AP Ferg]
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain’t true
And even though I want it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain’t true
And even though I want it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
But you know it ain’t true, you know it ain’t true
I’m tryna make a dollar, get my ass up out of Harlem
Cause you know the haters watching and the bullets ain’t cool
Ain’t you, attracted to a powerful motherfucker
Don't wanna be compared to these rapper dude motherfuckers
Who turnin' so passionate when they battling motherfuckers
But never get a crib up in Malibu motherfucker
And I don’t want to wind up like him
He can't afford that Tom Ford, you won’t like that man
Grinding that old food, no AC or fan
No trips to Jamaica, babe you gets no tan
I wanna pull up pull up in a 4-4 or Benz
A Sprinter van, with the TVs in
Your crew jump in, I’m getting those jeans
If we keep on, fuckin’ fly to Japan
You say that this shit mami, ‘cause you my girl
You say you just need me and need no one else
But I'm full of ambition to take over the world

[Chorus 2: Big Sean & A$AP Ferg]
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
And I know its true
And even though I got it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain’t true
And even though I got it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Funny how it all go go, you never could know though
What happened to Tiger was Kobe, you know hoes
Get caught in a photo, lipstick on your polo
And all the trust that you builds right out the door door
Y’all went from lovebirds to looking like Dodos
And that shit gon’ last, for months it’ll go go
And that shit gon’ drag, drag on like Komodo
Over a bitch that look like Quasimodo, god!
Now you calling and checkin' in
All the time like your ass still on parole though
Wondering if you just better off solo
You paying a price, but is that what it owe though?
Praying up to god about shit that’s not even holy
You like “she tripping over bitches saying that they know me”
Then she put the pussy on me, swear that shit control me
That shit control me, man that shit control me

[Chorus 2: Big Sean & A$AP Ferg]
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
And I know its true
And even though I got it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain’t true
And even though I got it all
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
I’m young, man, and I got everything to lose
