[Chorus]
Sometimes when you gone, I feel so alone
Keep it a hunna
Party to the sun up
Top shelf, ya you know, check freight gotta go
Keep it a hunna
Party to the sun up

[Post-Chorus]
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah I notice
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah I notice. Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been lovin' you for some time
But I gotta focus on me right now
Shawty fell in love with my pimpin'
Fifteen for the G's I'm drippin'
Undersea in her see my whip, yeah
All I had to do was listen

[Chorus]
Sometimes when you gone, I feel so alone
Keep it a hunna
Party to the sun up
Top shelf, ya you know, check freight gotta go
Keep it a hunna
Party to the sun up

[Post-Chorus]
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah I notice
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah I notice. Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Laid up, yeah you know that shit is paid out
Made up, yeah you know this shit cap now
In the vet, and she drive when I'm faded
Direct deposit can't afford no delays; yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes when you gone, I feel so alone
Keep it a hunna
Party to the sun up
Top shelf, ya you know, check freight gotta go
Keep it a hunna
Party to the sun up

[Post-Chorus]
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah I notice
I know that it's all alright
I notice, yeah yeah I notice. Yeah, yeah
