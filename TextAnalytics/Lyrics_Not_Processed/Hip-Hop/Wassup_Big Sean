[Chorus: Logic]
I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out
Never know, who's really down or just down and out
Never know, who's really down
I-I-I-I-I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out
Never know, who's really down or just down and out
Never know, who's really down, I-I-I-I-I'm like

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Bitch, I'm the one, I consistently prove
I stuck to the code like a finishing move (Yeah)
I hit a groove that they can't undo
And over the years all I did was improve
Don Life, toss dice
On on my off night, I left the doubts and now I'm alright
Yeah, I'm a new me, they haven't seen this shit like Vader wearing all white
Like I detonate you, hold it down, I levitate
I like a woman that's all-natural
I give her good energy and let it reciprocate (Yeah, yeah)
A young nigga that's tryna innovate
I been that way since Em and Jay did "Renegade"
You niggas hold up, don't get no closer
I try and told ya, bitch, we the closest
High powers chose us, we never froze up
You lucky if you get to see us close up (Straight)
'Cause people depending on me like (Ugh)
Tryna put a hit out on me, nah (Ugh)
How many times that shit work? None!
So blessed I might just make a whole gospel album (Yeah)
Perform at Sun Daze 'til it's time to rapture
Sean Don and Logic, instant classic

[Chorus: Logic]
I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out
Never know, who's really down or just down and out
Never know, who's really down
I-I-I-I-I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out
Never know, who's really down or just down and out
Never know, who's really down, I-I-I-I-I'm like

[Verse 2: Logic]
I'm finna tell it like it is
Game in a headlock like Stizz
Everybody know the deal, yeah, that boy—he keep it real
Higher than ever with no pill
I just updated my old deal
Told Def Jam no less than 20 mil'—and they cut that shit!
Yeah, I been at it like "Wassup, bitch?"
Put ya favorite rapper deep in a ditch
Ya favorite producer get murdered by 6ix
We touring the world from Japan to The Six
Nah, tryna get paid in full, call me syre like Jaden, fool
Uh, yeah, that's the power of will (Woo!)
Yeah, that's the power I feel!
I got so much in the bank
That I just called my lawyer to work on my will
Hold up, wait a second, chill
Hold up, wait a second, chill
Uh, I mean to Maryland, DC, Virginia
What J. Cole he mean to the 'Ville
Uh, don't do this shit for the thrill
Uh, I am coming for the kill
Tell me how you want it, gotta pedal to the metal
I'm a gunner like a semi-automatic, I'm bringin' the static
I had it, I had to get a unhooked like an addict
And yeah, I'm glad that it went the way it did
Never thought the radio would play the kid
They never care 'til you make it big
Now they say triple platinum
Finger-fuck the people said that never would happen
Came a long way from the trap
Where they was cookin' up crack
I'm still here, RattPack keep it real here
Big boy money, Uncle Phil here
Only "Fresh Prints" in my pocket
I came from nothin', no hater can stop it
Only the illest, you know that I got it
Sean Don and Logic, yeah

[Chorus: Logic]
I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out
Never know, who's really down or just down and out
Never know, who's really down
I-I-I-I-I'm like, "Wassup ho? Where you been? What you know about?"
Oh no! Who let 'em in? I'ma show 'em out
Never know, who's really down or just down and out
Never know, who's really down, I-I-I-I-I'm like
