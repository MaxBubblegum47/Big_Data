[Verse 1]
I've been holding this in
From the very first kiss
And I've been losing my mind
Tryina' keep up like this

[Pre-Chorus]
But we both know that there comes a time
And I hate to sound harsh, or unkind

[Chorus]
Love me or leave me alone
Hold me or just let me go
Cause I’ve felt this fire for so long
So baby love me, love me
Love me or leave me alone

[Verse 2]
If we’re just playin' along, then we’re just playin' ourselves
And I don't want you to know where somebody is
Cause there’s magic between you and I
And I hate this impatience of mine

[Chorus]
Love me or leave me alone
Hold me or just let me go
Cause I’ve felt this fire for so long
So baby love me, love me
Love me or leave me alone

[Bridge]
Cause we both know that there comes a time
And I hate to sound harsh, or unkind

[Chorus]
Love me or leave me alone
Hold me or just let me go
Cause I’ve felt this fire for so long
So baby love me, love me
Love me or leave me

Just love me, love me, love me or leave me alone
