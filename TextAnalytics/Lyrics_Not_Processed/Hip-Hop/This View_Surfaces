[Chorus: Forrest]
We live, and we lie, and we fall, and we fly
We win, and we lose, so, for now, let's all enjoy this view
We live, and we lie, and we fall, and we fly
We win, and we lose, so, for now, let's all enjoy this view

[Verse 1: Forrest]
Let it be, let it be as it is
Remember me, all we got are memories in the end
I wanna be humble, be a good friend
Give more slack than I'm bringing in
Cherish all the good times, learn from the rest
Heart on sleeve and head in chest

[Chorus: Forrest]
We live, and we lie, and we fall, and we fly
We win, and we lose, so, for now, let's all enjoy this view
We live, and we lie, and we fall, and we fly
We win, and we lose, so, for now, let's all enjoy this view

[Verse 2: Forrest]
Life can be so amazing, if we stop all the chasing
Good times are always waiting, so take a look around
And you'll never see them wasted
Turn the other cheek, switch your angle
Get out of the loop that's got you tangled
There's a sunset and a sunrise, so open your eyes

[Chorus: Forrest]
We live, and we lie, and we fall, and we fly
We win, and we lose, so, for now, let's all enjoy this view
We live, and we lie, and we fall, and we fly
We win, and we lose, so, for now, let's all enjoy this view

[Chorus: Forrest]
We live, and we lie, and we fall, and we fly
We win, and we lose, so, for now, let's all enjoy this view
We live, and we lie, and we fall, and we fly
We win, and we lose, so, for now, let's all enjoy this view
