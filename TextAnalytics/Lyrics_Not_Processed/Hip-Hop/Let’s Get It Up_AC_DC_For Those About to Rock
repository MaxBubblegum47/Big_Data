[Verse 1]
Loose lips sink ships
So, come aboard for a pleasure trip
It's high tide, so let's ride
The moon is rising and so am I

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up
Cruisin' on the seven seas
A pirate of my loving needs
I'll never go down, never go down

[Chorus]
So, let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it right up
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now

[Verse 2]
Loose wires cause fires
Getting tangled in my desires
So, screw him up and plug him in
Then switch it on and start all over again

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up, no
Ticking like a time bomb
Ooh yeah, blowing out the fuse box
I'll never go down, never go down

[Chorus]
So, let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it up, ow-ow
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now

[Bridge]
Get it up
Come on and

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
So, let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it up, ow-ow
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now
