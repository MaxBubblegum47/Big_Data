God was keepin' time there on the tin roof
The sky had built a night we can't forget
The flash flood found us underneath my jacket
Go runnin' there for cover, soakin' wet

That August water washed away her makeup
Never looked more beautiful to me
She fell asleep that night, there on my shoulder
Wrapped up in a towel there on the swing

She'll fill you up
Make you whole
Soak you down to the bone
Make you feel alive and keep you sane
She'll heal your heart
Feed your soul
Cover you and make you grow
Bring you back to life
And wash away the pain
God love the rain

That summer rain showed no sign of stopping
We waited out the storm between the sheets
And while the wind was whisperin' through the window
We did everything but fall asleep

She'll fill you up
Make you whole
Soak you down to the bone
Make you feel alive and keep you sane
She'll heal your heart
Feed your soul
Cover you and make you grow
Bring you back to life
And wash away the pain
God love the rain

When morning broke
That muddy river couldn't take another drop
And I pray to God
He'll never let it stop

She'll fill you up
Make you whole
Soak you down to the bone
Make you feel alive and keep you sane
She'll heal your heart
Feed your soul
Cover you and make you grow
Bring you back to life
And wash away the pain
God love the rain
God love the rain
