[Interlude: MC Serch]
Hey, what's up?
It's your boy MC Serch, talking about my man, Big Sean
You know, first time I met Big Sean, it was at the Kanye concert
With NERD and Keri Hilson and, um
He was just mad cool, he came up to me
Real big chain, lotta ice on his neck
I thought he was gonna have an ego
"Yo Serch, I'm Big Sean, big fan
I just wanna say, 'What's up'
You know I'm signed to G.O.O.D. Music"
It was mad cool and my wife and kids were with me
And my wife turns to me, she goes, "Who's that?"
I said, "Oh, it's Big Sean, you know, he's signed to Kanye"
She said, "Wow, he's a good kid"
I was like, "Yeah, nah, definitely a grown man"
And then he comes to the show and he's just- he killed it
He kills it off the head, he kills it free-styled
You know, it just shows why he was signed
Why Kanye signed him, man, he's a good dude
And I really hope he has the impact I believe he's gonna have
In upcoming years, in this-this culture
And in hip hop, so make sure you pay attention
