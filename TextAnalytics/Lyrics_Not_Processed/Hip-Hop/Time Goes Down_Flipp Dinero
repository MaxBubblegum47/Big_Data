[Intro: Flipp Dinero]
Yeah, yeah
I'm just kinda caught up wit' myself (yeah)
Livin' 'til my time goes down like it's supposed to
I can't really trust nobody else (yeah)
Either way my time goes down like it's supposed to

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it

[Verse 1: Flipp Dinero]
I, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whip the foreign like a drive by, Nina sitting with me that's for nine lives
I ain't really with the Allahs, pray to God to bless and judge our lives
Teachin' niggas 'til they're so fine, nigga see what I mean, yeah it's all mine
And niggas searchin' 'til they all find, niggas see you doin' good, it's all fine
And niggas fakin', yeah that's all time, bitches front and fakin', that's a small line
See I can't trust a soul, no, see I just want this dub, yeah
See I can't love these hoes, yeah, I stack it up and go, yeah
I wanna look wild when I flex it, get diamonds all up in my necklace
Got foreign all on me like Tetris
, get mama the crib she requested
Niggas hatin' that's their occupation, they can't stand to see another nigga make it
This shit here like history in the makin', this a fuckin' [?] so I'ma fuckin' take it like

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it

[Verse 2: Flipp Dinero]
I just want it all, I just wanna ball, Ima get it all, roll up to my guard
Vision hundreds doin hundreds in the car
Pain I'm feelin turn me all into a star
Tunnel vision mainly [?] the cars, Ima get it I can not show no remorse
I don't understand these niggas, no
They tryna imitate the difference, yeah
Ain't never complement the differents, no
It hit me cause I'm really gettin it, yeah
I can't get the hate that's coming from em I been really chasin' and it's all grind
Mansions in the hills I'm whipping foreign visas and I just wanna say it's all mines
I would know, I will really make it, I will really take it, I ain't with the fakin', I ain't with the play shit
I would know, I will really get it shinin' like a star, know my name with niggas knowin' who I are

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it
I would know, either way my time goes down like it's supposed to
I would know, money on my line, oh my gosh, yes I'm going to it
