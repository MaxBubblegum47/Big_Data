[Verse 1]
Ballin' since I was jit
Way before Oakland and filmin' the skits, I had a goal to get rich
Momma was strugglin' paying the rent
I couldn't help her wIth shit
Hate that I'm feelin' so stuck in this bitch 
(
Devo this shIt hard
)
Car broke down, can't fix that shit
I cried at night, I'll admit that shit
O2, old, I'll whip that bitch
She left me 'lone but I miss that bitch
If she text right now, I'll hit that bitch
Old friends like "How you get that lit?"
Same old me but they think I switched
Fuck old friends I don't know that bitch
Racks too big, can't fold that shit
Hand get numb when I hold that shit
Momma I told you we gon' be okay
Whippin' that Benz and she live in L.A
Tryna thank God but don't know what to say
Lot of square footage where DDG stay
Bought in August I'm movin' in May
Hop out the foreigns and black as my race
No it's not rented, It's facts in the bank

[Pre-Chorus]
Spent four hunnid on beanies, easy
She want dick, she needy, freaky
I like Wraiths, no Lamborghini
She off X, she sleepy, sleepy, yeah
Make me a wish no genie, genie
Vanish on niggas just like Houdini

[Chorus]
Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louie bag gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mm, got some millions but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamin's, we don't fuck with Jackson's

[Verse 2]
Bet when I drop, they don't post that shit (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
All good though, I'ma note that shit
When I blow you'll owe me bitch
Humble ass nigga but I know I'm rich (Yeah, rich as fuck)
Fuck that shit i know I'm lit
If we beef I fuck your bitch
All of the niggas I beef on the internet
I hit up all of they bitches and get 'em wet
Call her a Uber, I hit 'em and send 'em back
Do it in silence cause players' ain't in to that
No, oh, I hit his bitch on the low, oh
She said your dick game was so-so
And she had told me your broke (That's tough)
I got a blicky it sit on my hip because L.A is trickey
They tryna come get me
Bought some Balenci's they don't even fit me
They 950 but fuck it no biggie
I'm with a biddie she tryna get busy
She kiss on my neck but told her no hickey
Tryna get with me, I told her she silly
She just for the night cause my bitch is too pretty

[Pre-Chorus]
Spent four hunnid on beanies, easy
She want dick, she needy, freaky
I like Wraiths, no Lamborghini
She off X, she sleepy, sleepy, yeah
Make me a wish no genie, genie
Vanish on niggas just like Houdini

[Chorus]
Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louie bag gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mm, got some millions but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamin's, we don't fuck with Jackson's

[Outro]
Benjamin's, we don't fuck with Jackson's
I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
