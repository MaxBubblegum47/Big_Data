[Chorus: Jaden]
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I could fall asleep or stare in your eyes
You're right by my side
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I wrote you a poem for your surprise
It's right by your side

[Verse 1: Jaden]
Top off, when I'm not with you, I feel awful
She likes my ideas, she say I'm thoughtful
Look, look, I was zonin' in the whip
It's because of you I can exist, I swear
I just don't want to get my heart broke
This path is mine, I know (This path is mine)
I'm asking for your love

[Chorus: Jaden]
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I could fall asleep and stare in your eyes
We'll dance all night
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I wrote you a poem for your surprise
It's right by your side

[Bridge: Jaden & 
​¿​T​e​o​?
]
I hop out, ooh
I don't wanna go home
I hop out, ooh
I don't wanna go home (
So come on over
)

[Verse 2: Jaden, 
with WILLOW
]
Summertime is meant to fall in love
Why won't you confess to all of us?
Drip drop on my neck, that's octopus
I ain't get those texts, you know what's up
Sorry, honest
, you need to hear my side of the story
Let's talk, get low to highs, let 'em off
Sit at home, reading Vogue with a centerfold
Love is simple, it's all good 'til the crescendo
'Til they wake up and switch, we ain't playin' Nintendo
That's why when the sun sets I just stare at the window

[Chorus: Jaden]
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I could fall asleep and stare in your eyes
We'll dance all night
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I wrote you a poem for your surprise
It's right by your side

[Verse 3: WILLOW]
Oh, only you, only you, only you
Yeah, you make my heart race, yeah
Yeah, you make my heart race, yeah
Oh, only you, only you, only you, oh
Yeah, you make my heart race, yeah
Keep me from my dark place, yeah, from my dark place
Now I got my own place
Yeah, we were in love but we just
Yeah, we were in love but we just homies
We just homies
Only you, only you, only you
Yeah, you make my heart race, yeah
Keep me from my dark place, yeah, from my dark place
Now I got my own place, yeah

[Bridge: Kris Wu]
她说是
他摘一眼
Only tell me to answer 'til you say it right
她一眼
你的眼
If you don't know I'm about to tell ya

[Chorus: Jaden]
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I could fall asleep and stare in your eyes
We'll dance all night
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I wrote you a poem for your surprise
It's right by your side
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I could fall asleep and stare in your eyes
We'll dance all night
Summertime is meant to fall in love
I wrote you a poem for your surprise
It's right by your side

[Outro: Jaden]
And it's summertime
