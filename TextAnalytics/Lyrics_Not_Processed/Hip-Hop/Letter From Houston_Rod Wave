[Intro]
Your eyes staring back at me (Back at me)
My heart starts to skip a beat
I pray that you will never know
 (Never know)
I fall and then you look in my eyes
(Pipe that shit up, TnT)
(Tahj Money)
Hello?
What you doin'?
Laying here
Oh, just chillin'?
Just chillin'
You sad right now?
Yeah, I'm sad
I love you
I love you too
Hahaha

[Verse]
I wrote this song for you, so you should pay attention
I was just staring at the ceiling and got in my feelings
Reminiscing about us fighting, fucking, and chilling
Right now, I'm riding through Memphis, passing through the city
I'm with my niggas, but I miss you, girl, don't get it twisted
And I cannot wait 'til I see you, hug you, and kiss you
Remember when I had first met you how I used to sweat you
I used to call your phone and text you and tell you you're special
Like girl, you're special, you the kinda girl that I need
I actually made you mine, sometimes, I can't believe
Wonder what your nigga was thinking when he let you leave
You try to leave, I might get down on my hands and knees
I'm still a G, please believe, but girl, you make me weak
You make me feel something I never felt, the reason I never left
A lot of hoes want your position, but they tripping
You been with me since the beginning and that's the way I'ma end it

[Chorus]
But just in case you feel you cannot stay, babe
Cars, clothes, and hoes, I'd trade it all
For a guaranteed spot in your heart
Wonder do you miss me when I'm busy on the road?
Wonder do you hear me? I'm in Houston all alone
And I'm thinking 'bout you, yeah, yeah
I been thinking 'bout you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just in case you feel you cannot stay, babe
Cars, clothes, and hoes, I'd trade it all
For a guaranteed spot in your heart
Wonder do you miss me when I'm busy on the road?
Wonder do you hear me? I'm in Houston all alone
And I'm thinking 'bout you, yeah, yeah
I been thinking 'bout you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
