Ok I say that shit again, I said it once before
I just, I just, I just, I just want it all
I glisten and shine with miss's fine model chick
Big behind, bad enough to skip the line
But to me she just a nine
I hop up out that double o you can call me Mr Bond
Bitch I am a monster I belong on district 9
Catch me in my office, office, doin business
The f*ck you doin? Bullshitttin
I get all the eyes when I step inside and
They all arise when I am arivin'
Bring out the Rose, Nuvo, Ciroc and
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran
I guess they on somthin cause my neck look like horizon
Just a million people behind me and I don't have verizon
Man I'm chillin with my niggas nigga
And a couple cool bitches
What the f*ck u doin? Bullshitttin
Me and my niggazzz say it ain't Ton
Hundred pretty girliess singin our songgg
Yea I kick my feet up you can't say that I ain't home
And I be blowin on that reefer u can't say that it ain't strong and
She just, she just, she just, she just want a long dick
I put it in her mouth and now that bitch look like a conehead
When I'm done go ahead... what the f*ck this is? !
What the f*ck you doin? Bullshitttin
I hear, I hear, I hear man but that shit just don't compare
I tell you you the best, when I'm lookin in the mirror
By the time ya'll over here, I'm prolly over there
And by the time u ridin wat I'm ridin on I'm in the air
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy
My frequent flyer miles is in the thousies I'm outtie
Somewhere chillin in Maui swimmin with the scuba fishes
Wat the f*ck you doin? Bullshitttin
Nigga I be splargin
I beg my pardon
Cause yalll niggas is starvin
Lookin for a bargain
Gone and roll that weed yea I think it's time to spark it
Cause I be runnin through them trees niggas call me tarzan
Wat u think? we won't stop! gone stop?
Silly hoe I'm livin out my dreams don't you dare hit that alarm clock
I'm laid up with yo girlfriend u knockin like wat u doin nigga? !
I'm like f*ck YOU doin? ! Bullshitttin!
I hit you with an AMC, my nigga that's a full clip
And you could be like me if you just quit with all the bullshit
