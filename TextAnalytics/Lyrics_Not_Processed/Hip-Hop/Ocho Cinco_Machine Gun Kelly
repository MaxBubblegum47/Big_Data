[Chorus: French Montana]
I see you niggas from the side watchin'
Got a hundred grand in my side pocket
All the hustlers love it, you know I speak the lingo
Tell a bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Face down, ass up
Pull up in that spaceship with that top down
Bitch pass out, chain light up, they blackout
I'm like "haaanh,"
 
Ocho Cinco, that's a head-banger
I see a bitch lookin' thirsty, told her go and drink up
I head hunt, that new nigga, and what
Shorty got that ocho, good head, and butt I'm like "haaanh"
All I got for bitches is pipe water
I done came up off a night order

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Bitch gave me head till my legs shake (burrr)
She gave me the brain, but that doesn't explain
Why these lames be lovin' and cuffin' these bitches
I don't know shit about 'em but they head shape
Fuck that pussy 'til her legs break
Bustin', got a dirty dozen of them brown things
Waitin' in a room like an egg crate, uhh
B-A-D boy ho
And I got B-A-D bitches for my boys so
Treat 'em like pollo, serve 'em, black Suburban
Swervin' through the hood, gettin' head like turbans
Any job a good job, so she got a blowjob
Suckin' it from nine to five, that bitch workin'
Kells

[Chorus: French Montana]
I see you niggas from the side watchin'
Got a hundred grand in my side pocket
All the hustlers love it, you know I speak the lingo
Tell a bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco

[Verse 3: Los]
Man I say pimps up, hoes down
I say that to say that I only recognize these bitches
With they limbs up, or from the nose down
I tell her nose dive, then watch 'em go down
Bitch I'm cold as ice water
Put dick way down your throat until your eyes water
Lemme get that for you, lil mama cause you workin'
The way you twerkin', you gon' fuck around and get a Birkin
She like to crack the dutch down the middle, drop a purp in
Let me fuck her in the telly, screaming open up the curtains like
(Don't stop! Pop that, pop that!)
You know French cut,
 she got on French cuts
I don't French kiss, I let my friends cut
Me and Red in an all-red Benz truck

[Verse 4: Red Cafe]
I told French, I told Los, I get good head while I'm chauffeured
Momma told me, "get a nice girl with a good head on her shoulders"
Shake down, shake down, came up on them back blocks
Her face on my belt buckle, that's what I call laptop
Side niggas from the side watchin', guess they got a side view
Puff got me in this penthouse,
 that's my view
That's my crew, they shinin'
She only came so she could come, boss
And her first choice was the number one boss

[Chorus: French Montana]
I see you niggas from the side watchin'
Got a hundred grand in my side pocket
All the hustlers love it, you know I speak the lingo
Tell a bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco

[Verse 5: Diddy]
Yo bitch, I'm a motherfuckin' livin' legend
I'm 'bout to send these niggas through they fifth depression
In my absence niggas speaking silly
I could stand on the mountains and the streets'll feel me
Feel the rush and that Bad Boy
OBG that OG, don't OD cause that's bad boy
She feel royal when she 'round this
King Combs, now give me crown, bitch
