[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah, yeah
I get it, I get it
Yeah, yeah, I love Detroit
I get It, I get it, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
It's no young'n that's lyrical, uncomparable
Mine's is historical, they's is hysterical
Man my bank account is so numerical
I guess because I save like miracles
Oh, they tend to un-lie me, I been paid
Mr. West just signed me
They hoes love my money what I care if they like me
They probably rather have my green poke like palm trees
Ooh yeah, here in-come income
However I end up it'll be with my ends up
Isn't it ironic that the models on the posters that I used to pin up
Is the ones I pin up?
They looking at a nigga like oh my Jesus
I been a man, bitch, ever since I's a foetus
You bound to go broke trying to match what my fee is
It's evident and clear as a cheer to see that

[Hook]
I get money, money I got
I get It, I get It, yeah, yeah
I Love Detroit
I get it, I get it

[Outro: Big Sean]
