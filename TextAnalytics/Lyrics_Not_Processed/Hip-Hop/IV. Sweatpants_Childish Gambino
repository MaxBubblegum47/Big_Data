[Verse 1: Childish Gambino & 
Problem
]
Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked (Yeah?)
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok
 (Yeah?)
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP
Bino so insensitive, she askin' “Why you say that?!”
I'm chillin' (Yeah), real nigga feelin'
Rich kid asshole, paint me as a villain (Ma!)
Still spitting that cash flow, DJ Khaled
I got a penthouse on both coasts, pH balance
Real nigga, I rep those
Why though? 'Cause I said so
Hip deep in that Pepto, 
I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo
 (What)
You faker than some Sweet'N Low (Why?)
Yeah, you got some silverware
But really are you eating though? (Yeah)
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so E-M-O?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese (Yeah?)
Your girl, she jockin' these (Yeah?)
No hands like soccer teams 
and y'all fuck boys like Socrates
You niggas ain't coppin' these, niggas ain't lookin' like me (Nah)
Nah, I ain't checkin' I.D. (Nah), but I bounce 'em with no problem
Tell 'em, Problem (
Problem!
)

[Bridge: Childish Gambino & 
Problem
]
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (
What?
)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (
What?
)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (
What?
)
Rich kid, asshole, paint me as a villain

[Chorus: Problem]
What?
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' do? (What?!)

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Different color, my passport
Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my day wear
, and 
your girl drank my day care
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair, 
it's silver spoon coon, ho
Ain't nobody sicker in my Fisker, “vroom-vroom,” ho
Ain't nobody—
(Fiskers don't make noise when they start up, just so you know)
Top of the holy totem
Ri-ri-ri-rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, 
trippin' off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods
And I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that A-K-A
White hood, white hood, O-KKK
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
Show Maserati, you whippin' a Kia
Spendin' this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Wakin' up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dopeman, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
“
Err-eh-err-eh
,” onomatopoeia
Ohh, I got my cool on! (Tailor-made!)
I'm winnin' so they had to dump the Gatorade (Gatorade)
And I don't give a fuck about my family name

[Chorus: Problem]
What?
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' do? (What?!)
