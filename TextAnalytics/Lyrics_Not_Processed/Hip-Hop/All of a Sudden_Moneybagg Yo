[Intro: Moneybagg Yo]
Ugh ugh ugh
Fed shit
Ayy, gangster shit only nigga
Lil Baby, what's poppin'?
DMac got me too bangin'
All four of my pockets full now

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo & 
Lil Baby
]
I can't be totin' no handguns (Glock)
Unless that bitch come with a thirty (With a thirty)
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy (With a friend)
I can't be drivin' no regular cars (Skrt)
That bitch gotta come with a button (A button)
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of a sudden
I can't be rappin' for free, they gotta send me the budget (Send me that)
I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber (Slip in that)
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my cups be muddy
I just came home with nothin' (Woo)
Now I'm up all of a sudden
 (Hey)
Now I'm up all of a sudden (Hey)
Now I'm up all of a sudden
 (Hey, hey)

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Moneybagg, Moneybagg (Fuck with it)
I'm in the booth with a money bag
Here go the bricks, where the money at?
Give me a load, I ain't comin' back
I make 'em shoot where your stomach at
We gon' pull up where your mama at
Runnin' through hoes like a running back
We can fuck but you can't call this number back
If you knew better, baby you'd do better
I got plenty hoes, call me Hugh Hefner
I'm with Moneybagg, we went four federal
Four Pockets, Bread Gang, who better?

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo & 
Lil Baby
]
I can't be totin' no handguns
Unless that bitch come with a thirty
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy
I can't be drivin' no regular cars
That bitch gotta come with a button
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of a sudden
I can't be rappin' for free, they gotta send me the budget
I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my cups be muddy

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
If I said fuck you I meant that
I'm whippin' this coupe, I ain't rent that
The shit that you savin', I spent that
And if you want smoke you can get that
I just want proof of the backend
Any time I fuck her I hit from the back end
I'm pullin' her hair while I dig in her
She like hold up baby, keep my tracts in
I can't hit that bitch raw, got a glove on me
I'm in the trap with the drugs on me
I just went bonkers all up, Exclusive Game
Fly as fuck like a dove on me
Diamonds wet like a tub on me
Hurricane Harvey, flood on me
Left the spot with a dub on me
Walk in the spot, bitches tug on me

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo & 
Lil Baby
]
I can't be totin' no handguns
Unless that bitch come with a thirty
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy
I can't be drivin' no regular cars
That bitch gotta come with a button
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of a sudden
I can't be rappin' for free, they gotta send me the budget
I can't be fuckin' these hoes raw, I had to slip on a rubber
I can't be rockin' no plain jane, both of my watches be flooded
I can't be drinkin' on regular soda, all of my cups be muddy
I just came home with nothin'
Now I'm up all of a sudden
Hey, now I'm up all of the sudden, hey
Now I'm up all of the sudden
I just came home with nothin'
Now I'm up all of a sudden
Hey, now I'm up all of a sudden, hey
Now I'm up all of a sudden
