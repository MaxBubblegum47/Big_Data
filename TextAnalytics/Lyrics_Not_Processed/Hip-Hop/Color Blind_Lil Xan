[Chorus]
I've been so color blind
And I've been so color blind (haha, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, trips to the mall, I just tripped in the fall
I think I might really be the one after all, yeah
The one to rule them all, I'm the chosen one, the savior
But all these triple six, yeah
Make it look like I was up to no good
At least that's what my momma said, yeah
Now I'm the one givin' momma 
bread
Done with the pain, I'm just so heartless

[Chorus]
I've been so color blind
And I've been so color blind

[Break]
(I said)
(I said)

[Verse 2]
Love don't cost a thing, yeah
So all my girls need diamond rings, yeah, yo, yo
Text that I sent that you never ever read
Got me feelin' like you never ever ever really cared, yeah
But that's okay though
I hope you feel okay though
They used to call me Diego
My favorite drink is Faygo

[Chorus]
I've been so so so-

[Break]
(I said)
(I said)
I've been so color blind
I've been so color blind

[Chorus]
I've been so color blind (i said)
I've been so color blind
