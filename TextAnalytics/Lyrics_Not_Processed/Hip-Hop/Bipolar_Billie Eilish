[Intro: Billie Eilish]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
I lost myself again
But I remember you

[Verse: TheYoungestVI]
I lost myself again
When I felt alone in a room full of friends
I try to forget the tears I've shed
But I still remain blue despite all I do

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & TheYoungestVI]
Our love is six feet under
I canâ€™t help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Again
Again 
Again
Again 

[Outro: Billie Eilish]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
