[Intro]
Yeah, nigga like me, you know I love this shit homie love ya
A lot of hustle homie
If niggas know me then niggas know
If niggas know me then niggas know
If niggas know me then niggas know
I said if niggas know me then niggas know

[Verse 1]
If niggas know me they know I ain't with the fuckery
You say you need the job done? You know you 'posed to come to me
Grittin' for the girly face so she can live comfortably
Crazy how the mainy shit I done keep on huntin' me
We gon' sit outside his mama house until we thunder him
I don't fuck with fuck niggas, real nigga fuck with me
Ferragamo on me still saggin' when I buckle him
Grab the plate, draw a single file line and snuffle him
Bitches be in love with me, I don't love 'em bitches though
Cattin when it's spunky so I had to let them niggas go
Livin' grounds critical, flockin' at your physical
It's deeper than the punchline and tryna sound lyrical
You don't wanna live like this, my life difficult
It is what it is, I'm all in and I ain't trippin' though
Murder was the case, that's what all the shooters sittin' for
Still slide for my brother Zilla Zoe everyday
Pour baking soda in the pot and let it marinate
Snitchin' is a style now, niggas wanna narrate
Dope spot barricaded, task force Tuesday
Macintosh hangin' from an Airforce shoe lace
I was Jay Jonah'd up on every back to school day
Nookie niggas just a new addition to the food chain
Sippin' hella glue gang, pour another eight up
Don't wiggle through this motherfucker, get your shit ate up
I'm just bein' straight up, why you put the K up?
Twenty thousand got me feelin' like 100k up
All easy money like a layup, pay up
Them Zannies don't be helpin' when a nigga tryna stay up
You can ask the last ho I fired, I don't cake up
Transform a hooker with the Marc Jacob make-up
Breakin' up the dice game, let a thottie pipe drain
All this funk'll have you fallin' off like a bike chain

[Interlude]
I get love out here in Harlem man. I done sold coke on these streets man; hash, weed, heron. As long as niggas is feelin' it a nigga like me can hustle. That's my gift in life man, you know?

[Verse 2]
Murder is the mind state, boosted up the crime rate
If you gon' fuck around you gotta do that shit the right way
I be on my lonely, scared of what a nigga might say
Still a rat even if you dry snitchin' light weight
How you good homie, nigga? That ain't what the kite say
It's just another square from the hood like Radante
Clutching on picante, aim it at your noodle pack
Gave the kata back cause he ain't know what to do with that
Four finger banger baby and I'm still true to that
Give up anything if I could bring one of my shooters back
Zillas doin' videos with suckers, I ain't cool with that
If Perk was here he wouldn't approve either, why you doin' that?
Act like you don't knowin' them the humans that we loomin at
Fuck it up for all the real niggas with your stupid ass
40 in the Gucci bag, posted where it's boomin' at
Yellin' "free my level four niggas doin' super max"
Move a pack toot, a pack toot, a pack move a pack
Loyalty is everything, I'm tryna not to ruin that
Rich nigga always told me all you gotta do is stack
But every time the bitch is in it, I be runnin' through the stack
Wiggled out the hood for a minute and I'm movin' back
Hella niggas started dyin' I'm the one that influenced that
Gun shots'll never cease, gotta stay strapped for it
If a sucker catch me leakin' that just means I asked for it
Movin' at a fast pace accordin' to the dashboard
Cousin got a SK, blood tryna tax for it
I ain't tryna spend nothin' more than a rack for it
Doin' somethin' right now so I'ma double back for it
Rap about real shit, real niggas feel this
They don't comprehend it when I talk about a kill switch
All that in the field shit take you on a field trip
My lil niggas sick, he drill shit until the steel click
