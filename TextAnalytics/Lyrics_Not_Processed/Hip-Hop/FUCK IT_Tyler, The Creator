[Verse]
Yo, I've seen a lot of niggas
So when them niggas start talkin' reckless, I get offended
I get it, they try to keep a image
But look real closely at the pictures and you see that they chameleons
How you doin'?
You in the motherfucking building?
Nigga, I'm a architect, got another crane and I don't know if I'mma park it yet, you ain't even start one yet, fuck off my property
Tell Australia I'm sneaking in with a mic in my damn hand
Instead of the vegetables that I packed in my backpack
When Marshall had this problem, what the fuck was they telling him?
Is it cause of status or his melanin lacks black? Huh?
I think people love to be mad
How can I be misogynist? I love titties and ass
How can I be homophobic when my boyfriend's a fag?
And we been hiding in the closet like our passion is fashion
Still trying to come out
Couldn't deal with niggas who decide to take the fun out
Probably cause I like to be in places where the sun out
So comparing niggas lights is a motherfucking bum out
Thought y'all niggas nudists but y'all clothes
I was 'bout to tee off and putt-putt till the end
Now it's Anti-Golf Boys cause I don't fuck with my friends
Worse thing they gave me was an opportunity and a pen
Look, freedom of speech? My freedom was breached
Border Patrol put me on streets immediately
For shit I said when I was a virgin repeatedly
Posting on Hypebeast cause nobody would listen to me
My child is a product of me, very honest
Left of center, very different, they didn't want us
They didn't get us, didn't fit enough for their standards
Diverse and loud, so they ignored us
You put your life in a child that everybody hates
Now everybody hates papa despite that papa's great
But that's your favorite child boy that's your favorite one
(Got kids, nigga?) Nope, I'm talking 'bout that Cherry Bomb
I don't think they hear it, I was fearing deteriorating
Almost ate my spirit til the children cheered along
Watching them sing the songs
Eyeballs inspired from Pilot to 2Seater, I couldn't steer them wrong
That's why I rode the McLaren, couldn't stop at the Bimmer
"Tyler losing himself, and that nigga turned to a diva
That nigga preaching and wildin', that nigga smilin' and breathing
Tryna inspire all the little niggas that wanna be him
But fuck that!, We want:
Cats cats daddy problems
Kickflip fuck fuck, cupcakes buttrape
Golf Wang, daddy problems fag fag dad dad
Bike lake everything that I hate, plus being sad"
Y'all can cry about your year's top rap new albums
Golf did a quarter million in about two hours
Money money ain't the motive, but it is up for discussion
Niggas frontin' niggas wish that they could fuck with my production nigga
Saying you the plug, get your chords up
I was writing string sections on my tour bus
They adore me, my little birds
Be free, go flap your wings, I encourage it
Look, I wish I had a fucking xanax problem
So y'all talk about how I deep I am
Man-child in the flesh, bitch, I'm Peter Pan
You captain tier hook  muthafuckas won't ever be the man
I got a muthafucking vision, I don't see your plans
So shut your muthafucking mouth when I be speaking, man
Cause T the only sober nigga that be tweaking, fam

[Outro]
Fuck
I don'tâ€”I don't like rapping like that
