It's all because of brew
I'm feelin fresh and new
I bless a forty a day
So now I never have to have another sober day
When blessin' 40's I'm a pro
I just thought I'd let you know
You Can't take my brew away from me...

[Bizzy]
I down my 40 kinda slow; I like to savor it
And while the niggas try to down it
I like to save my shit
See, brew's a must to me, so put your trust in me
Yeah, I'm a stone-cold alcoholic for eternity
If you're an alchy and you know it, take a swig
If you're an alchy and you know it, take a swig
If you're an alchy and you know it
Takin' a swig will surely show it
If you're an alchy and you know it, take a swig
Now take a muthafuckin' gulp for the Bones, swig it
Hog it, dog it, or just leave that shit alone
I gotta get my buzz on: Olde, Gold, P.M., and Ides
I dip the joint into the brew so I can get high
And well, ya know what they say

Pass the 40, back the fuck up, bitch
You think I spent 2 dollars just to let you slop in my shit?!
And niggas swore I be stiffin', but niggas

I got influenced by foam because it gets me pumped to get a 40
Cause they love it when me pissy drunk
Yeah, my bitches be trippin' to see the film of my brew, shit
See what I'm a do, is, get rid of you, bitch

And since I drink St. Ides, yo

Bone's gettin' drunk and freakin' hoes
I'm chillin' with my niggas as I bless my forty O's
I'm poppin' off the cap, I down my shit and act a fool
You know we always brewed in the morning just for school
And if you have a party with the drink we hit it first, G
I knew I was a drunk when double-A couldn't help me, yeah
Niggas be trippin', ain't gave a sip, but they want a sip
Well, fuck that freebie shit;
You ain't got no money [broke bitch] you broke bitch!
The Bone works hard to get brewed all day
And we don't give a fuck about what sober niggas say
I stumbled into the house and people ask why
I dip the joint into the brew, so I can get high
My nigga Krayzie Bone hooked me with that bomb bud
Now roll me up a huddah, I'm about to hit the bud
Cuz, you know a friend with weed is a friend indeed
But a friend without a doubt is the one that bless da 40 ounce
Gotta bless my 40 or my crew will put me out

Who's next to bless da 40?
I don't wanna put you out
So Layzie Bone, bless da 40 ounce!

[Layzie]
Straight from the muthafuckin thieve land
Where you cop a 40 (you want a 40?)
Ounce for a dollar ninety, even
And drink a brew, I'll be a true nut and a alcoholic
You gotta problem, I gotta problem
But my brew will solve it
Don't try to stop me; I get drunk than a skunk
Cause I be rollin with the brew in the trunk
So, now you know that I be way past tipsy
Because my lips be steady takin sips, G
So many sips that I be drinkin' till my sud's gone
Because the Bones love to get they buzz on
And I'm a show you how to bless it like this
Hit to the bottom, to the top, and a smooth twist
Now check this: I'm a drink it 'til a nigga die
I dip the joint into the brew so I can get high and higher
Now I's think it's time a nigga announce that all day
Everyday, we just be blessin' da 40 ounce
