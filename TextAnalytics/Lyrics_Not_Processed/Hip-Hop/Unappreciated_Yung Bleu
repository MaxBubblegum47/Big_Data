[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Let me tell you about this situation
I been feeling so unappreciated
Everything I do, it ain't enough
I done been lied to, I done fell in love
You can't trust me and I can feel it baby
I been feeling so unappreciated
Everything I do, it ain't enough
I done been lied to, I done fell in love, love

[Verse 1]
Fuck these bags, fuck this cash
You was the only one I let go with my stash
Why the fuck you mad, all in your feelings
Tryna start some shit, we 'posed to be chilling man
I hate when you like that, why you acting like that
What the fuck is up with you, don't make me slap the fuck out you
Push me to the limit and I might go

[Chorus]
Let me tell you about this situation
I been feeling so unappreciated
Everything I do, it ain't enough
I done been lied to, I done fell in love
You can't trust me and I can feel it baby
I been feeling so unappreciated
Everything I do, it ain't enough
I done been lied to, I done fell in love, love

[Verse 2]
I'ma put your business in the street
I'm finna expose your ass
How many times I told your ass
Snappin' like you hard, actin' like you god
You ain't perfect by a long shot
Tell the people what you talkin' 'bout
Tell the people how you insecure
Stay startin' shit 'cause you not sure
Yeah, what the fuck I did to make you so ungrateful?
I'm steady bringing food to the table
Yeah, and I know everybody ain't able
Plus you ain't worked since I got with my label
And you my baby so I ain't ashamed
Say I saved you, girl I know I saved
And you my baby so I ain't ashamed
Say I saved you, babe you know I saved

[Chorus]
Let me tell you about this situation
I been feeling so unappreciated
Everything I do, it ain't enough
I done been lied to, I done fell in love
You can't trust me and I can feel it baby
I been feeling so unappreciated
Everything I do, it ain't enough
I done been lied to, I done fell in love, love
