[Intro]
Rap music? China?
What are they even saying?
Is this Chinese rap music?
 (
Boy
)
Sounds like they're just saying 'ching chang chong'

[Chorus: MaSiWei]
My chains, new gold watch, made in China
We play ping pong ball, made in China
给bitch买点儿奢侈品 made in China
Yeah Higher Brothers' black cab, made in 
China
She said she didn’t love me (Yeah)
She said she didn’t love me (Yeah)
She said she didn’t love me (Yeah)
She lied, she lied
She all made in China

She all made in China
She lied, she lied

把早餐放进陶瓷碗
 made in China (Yeah)
搽唇膏出门打起伞
 made in China
坐到公司里 旋转办公椅
360度 熟悉的印记
钢笔画了一朵莲花 cookin'需要放点盐巴
相框里面框住全家 全部made in China
全身上下总有中国货
亚利桑那也有中文课
Chinese入侵 local口音
野火燎原淋上酒精

[Verse 2: DZ]
Made in China的冠军
Made in China别挑衅
Made in China的货
老百姓用的开心
Made in China的
knowknow
Made in China的trap
Made in China的higher

抬头和观众say hello 戴起拳套的我不会退后
训练让我掌握节奏 几分钟内裁判宣布K.O
Tell me I'm good 音乐节舞台的正对面
Made in China 寓言般的歌词都兑现
大晴天醒来我充满了力量和高傲的斗志走进录音棚
肩膀上扛下的责任就像国家队赢得尊重用跳水游泳
现实让我不断吸取教训才会不断出现重复做过的梦
跨越了障碍那是我的工作别再抱怨起跑线有所不同

[Chorus: MaSiWei]
My chains, new gold watch, made in China
We play ping pong ball, made in China
给bitch买点儿奢侈品 made in China
Yeah Higher Brothers' black cab, made in China

Don't look at my diamonds, I swear they might blind ya

[Verse 4: Psy.P]
She lie, she lie, she lie 不要觉得意外
女孩 女孩 女孩为什么要离开
我的上辈子是李白 看我写歌那么厉害
所以不会感到奇怪 十二点的时候叫我起来
伴奏画龙点睛 我们那么年轻
不是和尚念经 也不可能变心
桌子上面放的麻将 一瓶
老干妈
的辣酱
外地人会受不了的辣 嘴巴开始发烫
咋个样 
麻辣烫
 回到属于我的Chinatown
四只手 舞狮子头 点燃火炮现在是时候 (Aye, aye)
你无法预料被我吓一跳 一直围到这个话题绕 (Aye)
Higher风格屌 啥到弄得到 你们家的东西全部都是中国造

[Verse 5: Melo]
阴阳风水 made in China
从太极两仪到八卦阵 made in China
万里长城 made in China
从秦始皇陵到紫禁城 made in China
You don't really know me
没得时间休息
藏在我的抽屉
捏在我的手里
兄弟我欢迎你来到这五千年历史中创造着神奇的国度里
Made in China能折服你
沦陷着 nobody saves me
