[Chorus: SAINt JHN]
She's my Monica Lewinsky
She gon' bust it right here, 'cause it's risky
She got a code like DaVinci
Only gotta text one time, "Did you miss me?"
She gon' want to resent me
'Cause me and her best friend got history
She got the walk of the century
Girl, you really got some kind of intrigue

[Verse 1: SAINt JHN]
I don't want no smoke
I don't wanna learn how to drive in the Rari'
If you gon' tell me to go slow
I don't wanna think 'bout the life that we could've had
Lookin' at the past through a snow globe
Bought you Louis, Chanel, brands
Yeah, to make up for the time wasted
Go slow when you in the Matrix (Brrt)
I don't mind loco
I don't wanna almost get rich and turn back
Baby girl, nah, nah, I'm almost so close
I don't wanna lay here alone in the mansion
The world feels cold when the door closed
Wanna know my opening statement?
'Cause even though I been waitin'
Baby girl, I'm impatient

[Chorus: SAINt JHN]
She's my Monica Lewinsky
She gon' bust it right here, 'cause it's risky
She got a code like DaVinci
Only gotta text one time, "Did you miss me?"
She gon' want to resent me
'Cause me and her best friend got history
She got the walk of the century
Girl, you really got some...

[Bridge: SAINt JHN]
We're repeatin' the cycle
I'm not good at no wifey
She kiss me with her eyes closed
That just means that she likes me
I'm not good at goodbye, though
It's the way that it might be
I'm was tryna go Michael
She was tryna go hyphy

[Verse 2: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Yee, right now, yeah
I don't wanna talk about it later, nah, nah, I want it right now (Now, now, yeah)
And your ex nigga tryna hit you up still, tell that nigga "Pipe down" (Now, now, yeah)
And I don't wanna be the one to put more guns, but I don't fight now
Yeah, you know that I don't fight now
You wasn't even my type before, yeah, but you're my type now
I ain't gonna lie, did you wrong, can I do you right now?
Whatever I did in the dark before, it's in the light now
Whenever you say you're leavin' me, I know you be right back
Whenever I say it, baby, I just hope that you don't believe it
I told you that you could be a star if you can reach it
I told you that you could tell me all your little secrets
Told you that could tell me all if you really needed
If you needed, 'cause...

[Chorus: SAINt JHN]
She's my Monica Lewinsky
She gon' bust it right here, 'cause it's risky
She got a code like DaVinci
Only gotta text one time, "Did you miss me?"
She gon' want to resent me
'Cause me and her best friend got history
She got the walk of the century
Girl, you really got some kind of intrigue

[Bridge: SAINt JHN]
We're repeatin' the cycle
I'm not good at no wifey

We're repeatin' the cycle

It's the way that it might be
I'm was tryna go Michael
She was tryna go hyphy
