[Intro: Sade]
Keep tryin' for you, keep cryin' for you
Keep flyin' for you, keep flyin', and I'm fallin'
Keep tryin' for you, keep cryin' for you
Keep flyin' for you, keep flyin', and I'm fallin'
Keep tryin' for you, keep cryin' for you
Keep flyin' for you, keep flyin', and I'm fallin'

[Verse 1: Ramirez]
Twist me up a blunt, I'm smokin' on a ghetty green
The Grey Gorilla comin' out the Amazon, I'll cause a murder scene
Psycho, schizo, boy, I'm just a maniac
Poppin' pills to calm me down, but I just don't know how to act
Floatin' down the bayou with two corpses, sleepin' with the fishes
Dishin' out the game that I was taught, that shit is cold pimpin'
Never lackin', always packin', shit is gettin' hectic, mane
Niggas tryna take my life 'cause jealousy is in their vein
Call my momma, let her know her son is doin' little better
Still depressed but I been doin' alright since I got some cheddar
Didn't have no pot to piss in but I kept on with my mission
Tryna get my Franks up and live my life with disposition

[Bridge: Sade]
Keep tryin' for you, keep cryin' for you
Keep flyin' for you, keep flyin', and I'm fallin'
Keep tryin' for you, keep cryin' for you
Keep flyin' for you, keep flyin', and I'm fallin'
Keep tryin' for you, keep cryin' for you
Keep flyin' for you, keep flyin', and I'm fallin'
Keep tryin' for you, keep cryin' for you
Keep flyin' for you, keep flyin', and I'm fallin'

[Verse 2: Ramirez]
Glock cocked, Glock popped, now a nigga dead and gone
Deep inside of hell is where I lay my head and call my home
Make sure you call yo' reverend when I pull up to yo' fuckin' place
Grab the gauge and shoot that motherfucker straight up in his face
Killin' a busta, strike the name up out my fuckin' blacklist
Redrum carved up in my mind, a new blade just to slit my wrist
Lay beneath the dirt, I reappear up in the dark at night
Stand inside the pentagram, I read the scriptures then recite
God can't save me, I came to fuckin' die
Sacrifice an unknown body then become immortalized
Burn a church, quench my thirst, in the burnin' flames is where I lurk
When you look inside my fuckin' eyes, you see the hate and hurt
Comin' out the crazy house, I creep up, better lock yo' door
Suck the barrel like a dick up on this Magnum .44
You talkin' to the devil's son with Three 6 on the stereo
Lookin' down straight at the floor with blood up on the fuckin' snow

[Outro]
Niggas don't keep it real [?] shoot your motherfuckin' ass
Niggas don't keep it real [?] shoot your motherfuckin' ass
Niggas don't keep it real [?] shoot your motherfuckin' ass
Niggas don't keep it real [?] shoot your motherfuckin' ass
