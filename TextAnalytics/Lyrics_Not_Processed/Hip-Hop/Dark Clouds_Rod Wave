[Intro]
Trillo Beats, you did it again
You know, I'm in New Jersey right now
It's like four in the mornin'
It's me and T in this bitch, my nigga Dre in this bitch
Uh, uh

[Verse]
Flushed all these Percocets (Why?) they wasn't workin' yet
Quarter pound on my bus, we finna murda that
Today was okay, but I been feelin' sorrow (What up?)
Tonight I'ma pray it's better by tomorrow
Say mama, hey, mama, I been feelin' homesick
It's demons inside my heart and I can feel 'em growin'
I brought people around me without even knowin'
They all had secrets agendas that they wasn't showin' (Showin')
Bitches will stab you in yo' back but smile in yo' face (Face)
Niggas will act how they act but they want yo' place (Yo' place)
Say that's it's love out they mouth, but that shit be fake (Fake)
So I been lookin' for peace and beggin' for space (What up?)
And, Lord, I'm just a nigga tryna win, uh
Lord, I'm just a nigga, so I sin (Rrah, rrah, rrah, rrah)
We spin his block, we spin his block then spin again (Mm)
He gotta pay for what he did, yeah

[Refrain]
I been feelin' pain for so long (What up?)
I done became numb
I don't make it no better, I give my heart to whoever (Whoever)
They take it and they run, mm, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
You had me but you lost me (Lost me)
I'm not mad, I'm exhausted (Exhausted)
Please, please, if you come around (Yeah)
Gimme somethin' to make me smile

[Chorus]
And it's so many dark days
It's so many dark days and dark clouds
It's been so many dark days (Rrah, rrah, rrah)
Been so many dark days and dark clouds

[Interlude]
Like a big-ass black cloud been following a nigga 'round, I been tryna shake that bitch
Then niggas come around with that energy
Make it even fuckin' worse, I don't even⁠— man, I be⁠—

[Chorus]
It's been so many dark days
Been so many dark days and dark clouds (I get a nigga from 'round me fast)
It's been so many dark days (Ask me, feel me)
Been so many dark days and dark clouds (Uh, uh)

[Refrain]
I been feelin' pain for so long, uh
I done became numb
I don't make it no better, I give my heart to whoever, uh
They take it and they run, mm, mm

[Outro]
You had me but you lost me
I'm not mad, I'm exhausted
Please, please, if you come around
Gimme something to make me smile (Make me smile)
