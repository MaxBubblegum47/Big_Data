I'm a gorilla in the fuckin' coupe
Finna pull up in the zoo
I'm like Chief Keef meet Rafiki—who been lyin' "King" to you? (Woo)
Pocket watchin' like kangaroos
Tell these clowns we ain't amused
'Nana clips for that monkey business, four, five got change for you
Motorcades when we came through
Presidential with the planes too
One better get you with the residential
Undefeated with the 'caine too
I said no to the Super Bowl, you need me, I don't need you
Every night we in the end zone, tell the NFL we in stadiums too
Last night was a fuckin' zoo
Stagedivin' in a pool of people
Ran through Liverpool like a fuckin' Beatle
Smoke gorilla glue like it's fuckin' legal
Tell the Grammy's fuck that oh for eight shit
Have you ever seen a crowd goin' apeshit? (Rah, ayy)
