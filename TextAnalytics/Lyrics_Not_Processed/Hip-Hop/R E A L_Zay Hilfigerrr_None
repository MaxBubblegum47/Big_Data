[Verse 2: Zay Hilfigerrr]
I told my mama I'ma take her to the 'Hamas
No drama, we can leave the States behind us
Yeah, the 'Hamas
Yeah, yeah

Turn your speakers up, new release from Dubb
Mama told me I'm too young for love
Man made a drink, fell in love with the Crush
Let's do it, too much sauce, we get lost all in this music
This ain't talk, I just walk the walk and I prove it
Don't confuse it, Rayy, they clueless
Show up and show out, ooh we get stupid
Ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

They say I ain't real, no
They say I ain't real, oh

Boy I'm real, I'm real like this
