[Verse 1]
Hey, girl, how you doing? Look, I'm double-R, girl, I'm a star
Just like the ceiling I got on my car
Just like the ceiling, girl, take off your top
Look, I'm with a hottie, so I flew that bitch to New York
I put that bitch in New York, huh
I put on Christian Dior, huh
I pull up Bentley truck, huh
I pull up Bentley truck, huh
I put my trust in her, huh
She know she just like a drug
She come through and wet me up
She my lil' freak in disguise
Gettin' head while I'm grippin' her thigh
She on my head, I don't even know why
She in the bed, we gon' need more time
She keep it wet, I don't need no dry
Fuck me good, I don't need no lies
Uh, uh, girl, glad I tried
Go'n bend over, you don't even know how to ride
Love me forever, I don't need no change
Turn a nigga down when you see me on the train
Couple weeks later, when you see me, I'm your type
Next time you see a young nigga, I'm pipe, yeah
I am not regular, this not a Tesla
I'm with a baddie, ate her like an edible
I'm in a V12 eatin' vegetables
I'm in the back of this bitch with my leg up
She got that waterfall, she got that wet stuff
She got that wet-wet, I'm tryna bless that, huh
Girl, where you want me to nut at? Yeah
Girl, where you want me to nut at? Yeah

[Chorus]
Sex, I need some wet shit
Neck, I need some becky
Yeah, I'm a lil' manish, yeah
Kiss on your belly, yeah
She got that wet shit, yeah
She got that wet shit, yeah
She got that wet shit, uh
She got that wet shit

[Verse 2]
We can fuck in the back of my ride
On the balcony all outside
In the master suite, we out of town
I'ma fuck you 'til the sun go down
I want you, you want me and my love
I want loyalty, then I want love
Wanna argue with me about trust
Girl, where would you be without us? Huh
She got that wet, soaking wet
Girl, let's go jet-skiing
Girl, you're the best, I mean it
I ain't gon' flex, I mean it
Four by four, took the doors off
She suckin', I'm takin her clothes off
She suckin' like she ain't got no teeth in her mouth
Go 'head, bitch, show out
I'm pullin' her weave, hope I don't pull her track out
Pull off in a Trackhawk
Lil' bougie bitch, I blew her back out
Lil' booty bitch, she got an ass now
Yeah, I caught her in Magic
Think the first night, I smashed it
Caught an audible, passed it
I like my hoes naughty and nasty
I love when them hoes call me daddy

[Chorus]
Sex, I need some wet shit
Neck, I need some becky
Yeah, I'm a lil' manish, yeah
Kiss on your belly, yeah
She got that wet shit, yeah
She got that wet shit, yeah
She got that wet shit, uh
She got that wet shit, yeah
