He gon' want to ride off in a Ghost with me (I'll make him do it)
I might let your boy chauffeur me
But he gotta eat the booty like groceries
But he gotta get rid of these hoes from me
I might have that nigga sailin' his soul for me
Ooh, that's how it 'posed to be
If he wants me to expose the freak
Ooh, that's how it 'posed to be
Ooh, that's how it 'posed to be
Ooh, that's how it 'posed to be
Everything good like it 'posed to be, ooh
