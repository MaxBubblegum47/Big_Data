[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & Jacquees]
Let's hope they don't take this one down, man
Ooh, mm, mhm
Yeah
OG Parker

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator & Jacquees]
What's the dealio? Ain't gon' lie, I'm feelin' you
You got me on tippy-toe, so who's Oliv, who's Elio?
It don't matter, negative niggas gon' say, this don't add up
But fuck they math up, shit, we subtract 'em
Ayo, tell me what's the prolo, I just pop models
Boys or girls these days, shit, it don't matter
We can fuck Sunday 'cause I don't read Bibles
But I'm faithful to this money and these Céline goggles
I don't pop bottles, I just cop automobiles full throttle
New engine can't follow, get a jet to Lake Como
We can try some new gelato, shawty, I'm for real
Like my role model, hm
So let's—
Shawty, I listen
Unlike my father, I can give you attention (Ayy!)
You won't feel empty like pocket that lint in
So pack a few bags I got space in my mansions (Plural)
Hurry with decision
'Cause I'm looking for a parrot and you looking like a pigeon
Better That's So Raven and get another vision
If you wanna be my newest edition like Bivins, woah

[Chorus: Jaquees]
Feel like you need some validation (Yeah, yeah)
I got a plan 'cause you're more than that
No better situation, girl
No, no,  girl you all for that, and I 'magine that
Feel like you need some validation
While I'm grippin' your waist, we move to your pace
No better situation (come on)
Girl, I'll be your escape, come and swing my way

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Jacquees]
You think niggas full of lies
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Golf Wang, Golf shit man
Shout-out Jacquees
Switch it up, pick my car up in, in a hour
This view is beautiful
