[Intro]
Mmm
I ain't tryna (Ah)
I ain't tryna
I ain't tryna

[Verse 1]
Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high heel shoes
I'm clumsy, made friends with the floor
Two for one, you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottle, made a good girl pop

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club, tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew, chew, chew, 'cause they hope I choke

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss

[Verse 2]
Said bitch, I'm the after, you been the before
I been the stallion, you been the seahorse
Don't need a report, don't need a press run
All of my bad pics been all my best ones
I wear the hat and I wear the pants
I am advanced, so I get advance
And I do my dance and cancel the plans
Said boo, don't be mad 'cause you had the chance

[Pre-Chorus]
Drop, said I took it and I ran for it
I won it, then I stand on it
Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, let them put a tan on it
Said I took it and I ran for it
I won it, then I stand on it
Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, let them put a tan on it like

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss

[Bridge]
Rrrr, ah, ah, ah
I'm a bitch (I'm a bitch), I'm a boss
I'm a bitch (I'm a bitch), I'm a boss
I'm a bitch (I'm a bitch), I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
