[Intro: Blac Youngsta]
Yeah yeah yeah bitch, ho (Tay Keith produced this)
You-you-you should've minded your business, lil' bitty bitch
Give no fucks, nigga
Go against the- go against the- go against the gang nigga
You'll get your motherfuckin' ass kidnapped bitch

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
They ain't talking money, hang up on 'em (gang)
Yeah, my bitch got my name on her (name)
Let my nuts hang on 'em (hang)
Niggas get jammed, they sang on you (sang)
Nigga set tripping, bang on 'em (bang)
Gang gang gang gang gang on 'em (gang)
Put your fingers, in the air (bang)
Twist 'em up, gang on 'em (bang)

[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
They say it's money on my head, it's a fee on 'em
Wrist like snow, you can ski on it
Pull up in a truck, big B on it
I heard you talkin' ganster shit and we on it
Yeah, they say they gon' kill me (what else?)
They say they gon' rob me (what else?)
The say they gon' do this and that
To be honest them niggas just 'flauging (cap)
I'm hearing voices in my head saying shit on 'em
So I'ma fuck this cash up and shit on 'em
I might pull up, leave 'em wet, rain on 'em
Shooting accurate, it got a good aim on 'em
Pull up in a foreign whip, shit stain on 'em
My lil ganster bitch went got my name on her
MoneyBagg with the double G
Swag doper than a quarter key
I got the juice like I'm Bishop, you softer than tissue
Ain't tough, you get issues
Hop out the Lambo with Youngsta
He'll take out the trash, you know that he dumping
I'm sipping promethazine
I put that Act in a slushie from Sonic
My lil niggas on go like a green light, you play with me
The gon' crash like a dummy, hey

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
They ain't talking money, hang up on 'em (gang)
Yeah, my bitch got my name on her (name)
Let my nuts hang on 'em (hang)
Niggas get jammed, they sang on you (sang)
Nigga set tripping, bang on 'em (bang)
Gang gang gang gang gang on 'em (gang)
Put your fingers, in the air (bang)
Twist 'em up, gang on 'em (bang)
Bang (gangbang), gang gangbang (bang, gangbang)
Me, my young niggas (gangbang)

I'm tougher than Suge Knight (gangbang)
Fuck with me you'll get shot ho (gangbang)

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
Everybody know I'm strapped ho
I shoot your grandma in the back ho
Her old ass should've never been in the way
That's why her ass got clapped ho
I don't show no sympathy
I ain't got no love for these bitches, I just bought Glocks for my hitters (19)
And you better not blank on a mission (lil bitch)
And you might get rank if you kill 'em
Drive by, let it go
Ride-ride, bullets (gang)
Fly fly, somebody
Die-die (gang gang)
You don't wanna fight no hitter? (no)
Nigga I'ma shoot you in the face (duck)
I ain't gotta know when, if you put your hands on me lil nigga
I'ma catch a murder case (gang gang)
I'm ridin 'round with my tool out (gang gang)
You even been in a shoot out? (gangbang)
I shot a nigga's mammy crib up a hundred times
Made that lil bitch move out (fuck nigga)
I wanna see what you gon' do 'bout it (bitch)
I'm tryna take your whole crew out (bitch)
You better chill lil whore (whore)
Before it be another shoot out
Gang gang gang, bang, gang
