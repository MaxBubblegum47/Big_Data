[Chorus]
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers (yuh)

[Post-Chorus]
I be on my Mac Demarco shit
Break my heart then smoke a cig
Even put some cloves in it (cloves cloves cloves)
Don't test me because my skin ain't thick
Hit your walls, I need my fix
Pull up on you, I need…

[Verse 1]
Way more with you
Had too much of these hoes
Never told you 'bout the summer that I spent with my bros
Doin' things like your legs
Just gon' stay open now they closed
Thought I'd fix the road
But now you out here flyin' on your own
Nah…

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

[Chorus]
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers

[Verse 2]
All these parties I attend
But never know the celebration
I let you do what you want
No need for explanation
You go through my mind all day
All night, it feels like immigration
One of these days I'll fuck around
And book a flight up to Manhattan
Don't wanna see you go but I'd do the same as you
Don't see why you would go back to seein' me when you
Didn't wanna hurt my feelings but I couldn't get a clue
Didn't wanna seem perceivin' 'bout the things that you pursue

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
And it made me think of colors of the space
70 miles up in my coupe
And not a thought 'bout steppin' on my brakes

[Chorus]
I done seen you glow like that, I must say that I'm proud
Thinkin' 'bout the times when you would go into my house (ayy)
Had to let you go like that, I'd say it fucked me up (ayy)
You live in my head without a doubt (ayy)
Always anxious, got your picture on my necklace (yuh)
Say I'm smart but never seen a day of campus (skrrr, skrrr)
Gave me 'nani, don't be sorry, we're just reckless (skrrr, skrrr)
Think about you every time I see your drawers

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I be on my Mac Demarco shit
Break my heart then smoke a cig
Even put some cloves in it (cloves cloves cloves)
Don't test me because my skin ain't thick
Hit your walls, I need my fix
Pull up on you, I need…
