[Intro: Lil Tjay]
No, no
Lil Tjay, yeah
Yo, yo, yo
RellyMade
Two, three bands and you thinking shit sweet, little nigga
I ain't never gon'...

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Tjay]
Two, three bands and you thinking shit sweet, little nigga
I ain't never gon' extend my hand
If we two deep verse your whole block deep
Swear to God, I ain't never gon' fail my man
Money gon' come like the money gon' go
All these fake niggas started getting too close
So I stay with my guys that been by my side
'Cause I know they gon' ride 'til the car can't drive

[Chorus: Lil Tjay]
New drip, had to pick up some sauce
New kicks, I don't care what it cost
Ruthless, I don't care who you lost
Stupid, I done turned to a boss
And I know they don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see a young boy win
They don't wanna see a young boy win

[Verse 1: Lil Tjay]
When I come home, there's a whole lot of gang shit
As a youngin, I just wanted to be famous
Hopped in the booth 'til we scream that we made it
Other day I was recording in the basement
Now I pull up to a show in a spaceship
How you screamin', "Day one," doin' fake shit?
Nowadays bad bitches wanna taste it
Pull up on the S, show love, that be gang shit
And if they let me in the game, I'ma change it
Ain't a lot of niggas say ever basic
Pop out, I'ma stain, Balmains and some Bape shit
Niggas see me, they ain't never gon' say shit
Bustdown, ain't never gon' take this
Money I got, lil' nigga, can't make this
Countin' blue strips, broke niggas gon' hate this
Mama so proud, I'ma take her on vacation
I be goin' hard, remember used to starve
Remember selling nicks right on the boulevard
Going downtown, tryna steal a nigga car
And if I call Tut he'll pull a nigga card
I don't play the field no more without a hammer
Brodie on the news, whole face on the camera
Free all my day one niggas out the slammer
Opp nigga told, black and white, he a panda
Got me finna run up in his crib like I'm Santa
All of this designer got me broads in Atlanta
Honestly, I ain't playin' games no more
And they been on my dick 'til my thing feel sore
Bitch said I'm trash, shorty, change your drawers
I ain't worried 'bout you, why you worried 'bout me?
I'ma still pop out with a fresh white tee
With some retro J's and some fresh Nikes

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Tjay]
Two, three bands and you thinking shit sweet, little nigga
I ain't never gon' extend my hand
If we two deep verse your whole block deep
Swear to God, I ain't never gon' fail my man
Money gon' come like the money gon' go
All these fake niggas started getting too close
So I stay with my guys that been by my side
'Cause I know they gon' ride 'til the car can't drive

[Chorus: Lil Tjay]
New drip, had to pick up some sauce
New kicks, I don't care what it cost
Ruthless, I don't care who you lost
Stupid, I done turned to a boss
And I know they don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see a young boy win
They don't wanna see a young boy win

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Check up, they don't wan' see me win
Flex up, I'ma jump out the gym
New water, watch that young boy swim
I got it the harder way like I'm Tim
In that Maybach, you can't see through the tint
I ride foreign but bro in a stolie
Had to make me some plays on my dolie
Think I made it, these bitches all on me
No, this is not a chain, this a trophy (Hey)
Boss up, he a baby like Jody
Used to go hit a stain for the OZ's
When I put on the ice, it be odee
I'm talking money, put that cash on a threeway
Doin' the dash on a freeway
I knew I would get it, they didn't believe me
Baby, I make it look easy
Your bitch keep callin' and sayin' she need me
I know she see me with Tjay
I'm sippin' fours of that drank, movin' slow-mo
But my whip do the speed race
She wanna link up a ho, that's a no-go
I been stackin' my cheesecake
Yeah, I get to the racks and I'm above the rim
Collecting the bag and I do it again

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Tjay]
Two, three bands and you thinking shit sweet, little nigga
I ain't never gon' extend my hand
If we two deep verse your whole block deep
Swear to God, I ain't never gon' fail my man
Money gon' come like the money gon' go
All these fake niggas started getting too close
So I stay with my guys that been by my side
'Cause I know they gon' ride 'til the car can't drive

[Chorus: Lil Tjay]
New drip, had to pick up some sauce
New kicks, I don't care what it cost
Ruthless, I don't care who you lost
Stupid, I done turned to a boss
And I know they don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see the young boy win
They don't wanna see a young boy win
They don't wanna see a young boy win

[Outro: Lil Tjay]
No, no
Gang, gang
Yeah
They don't wanna see the young boy win
No, no
Yeah, yeah
Gang, gang, gang, Lil Tjay
