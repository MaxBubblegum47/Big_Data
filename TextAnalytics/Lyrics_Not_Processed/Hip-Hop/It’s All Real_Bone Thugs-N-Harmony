[Intro]
Krayzie Bone and the bone
With my mighty-mighty warriors
With my mighty-mighty warriors

[Chorus]
It's all real what you see
I said it's all real (it's just the thug in me)

[verse 1]
Nigga just because Krayzie quiet speak less
Don't be mistaking my kindness for weakness
Humble but ready to rumble
My violent side I can't deny
I'm like a Jekyl and Hyde, gemini
Look if you see me quiet, then I'm plotting to riot
Why tell me why tell me why
In they eyes I'm labeled a menace but I like it
Destroy ya, paranoia will make me blow you away, but hey
Nigga got too close to me
And that ain't how it's supposed to be
Nigga want respect but what do you show me
You, playa hate and anticipate the day that you can see me fall
Better act like you know I'm rolling with Mo, posse up
Do damage and manage to wiggle our way out of handcuffs
As we strut as thugs we must doing our best to obey god Violent in these times
Got to do what you gotta do war till ninety-nine
Slim nigga, gotta get up and come and get it if it's really coming
Now I got it and I'ma floor these niggas acting crazy
The safety's off come and get it if you really want it, yeah
(Yeah, Yeah) It's hating baby they gotta be so cold You gotta be heartless in certain situations like 
retaliation

[Chorus]
It's all real what you see (truly real)
I said it's all real (it's just the thug in me)
It's all real what you see (truly real)
I said it's all real (it's just the thug in me)

[Bridge 1]
Niggas be keeping it all real
We keeping it all real
With the real if it's real
And stay real, be real
Niggas be keeping it all real
We keeping it all real
With the real if it's real
And stay real, be real
We come with nothing but the real thing baby
Krayzie got nothing but the real thing baby
We come with nothing but the real thing baby
Krayzie got nothing but the real thing
The real thing, thing

[Verse 2]
Baby now this is the sound of me and my trues we put this down way down
So now if you hear me releasing some shells
Hit the ground with the quickness lay better stay down
On the darkside take a look and you'll find true niggas like no other kind
Nigga say fuck the wine
Indo inside, swisher sweet get me high

[Bridge 2]
Ain't nothing get to nothing something got to be real, real Something got to be real
Ain't nothing get to nothing something got to be real, real Something got to be real
I still be thuggin in the khakis boots and skullies
And since I'm a weed fiend for the green
Nigga gotta make that money man
I still be thuggin in the khakis boots and skullies
And since I'm a weed fiend for the green
Nigga gotta make that money man
It's real always, it's real always
It's real always, it's real always
It's real always, it's real always
It's real always, it's real always

[Verse 3]
Last night I P.O.D'd 
next to me Ouija, Ouija
And I fell in this fucked up state of mind
Slipped in the dream and I see demons screaming telling me it's time to die
Why me, I see, some niggas they coming to get me
They creeping outside of my window
I'm ready to bang bang bang
Aim the 12 gauge pump and my lead go
Give it up for the bloody murda mo
Bloody murda mo mo, mo
See that nigga when he go through the window
Had to put a bigger hole in his soul
If he get away running out my backdoor with me sawed-off swinging
Get ready to duck now
To the guts buck pap pap pow

[Bridge 3]
I claim my thang to slang
(murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo)
Them bloody bodies kill 'em all
Send them hoes up in flames
Krayzie insane to the brain
I claim my thang to slang
(murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo)
Them bloody bodies kill 'em all
Send them hoes up in flames
Krayzie insane to the brain

[Verse 4]
Now I know I done did some dirt in my time
Cause the devil was stressing my mind
Messing with my mind
Nigga, Bone stoned off a deadly high
Turned out, realize that everyday
I can do it if I only pray, maintain
Cause a nigga was lusting for money
Had to get it cause a nigga was struggling
I hit em with the 
Mossberg
Y'all heard 
of
 
Mr. Sawed-Off Leatherface
 till them lay
Round after round after round, they'll fall down down
May they lay, may they lay from the eruption man
We putting them six feet deep we buck we bang

[Chorus]
It's all real what you see (truly real)
I said it's all real (it's just the thug in me)
It's all real what you see (truly real)
I said it's all real (it's just the thug in me)
It's all real what you see (truly real)
I said it's all real (it's just the thug in me)
