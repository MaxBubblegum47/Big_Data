[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
Bag flippin', cash trippin'
Pull up, beat the block like a ass whoopin'
Stashbox, keep the stash in it, racks in it
Bought that bitch a Fashion Nova dress just to see her ass in it
Twerk for my Instagram
She just got a hundred missed calls, it's her man, damn
Oh, that's your nigga now, huh?
Said you wasn't with him, now you with him now, huh?
Things different now, huh?
You committed now, huh?
I guess I can't hit it how I hit it now, huh?
Well, hit me when your nigga ain't around
There's money to be made, bitch, I won't wait around
I flex on her for fun, but I do not play around
S on my chest and I keep a cape around
Gang gang with me, yeah, I keep like eight around
Even when you think they ain't around, they around
Woah, woah, woah, we ain't playing fair
Oh no, no, you don't want to take it there
Thinkin' 'bout my next move in my thinking chair
This chip is on my shoulder and it's stayin' there
'Cause I been through a lot of bull
And they can't stand me 'cause I'm misunderstood
And I need a bad bitch just to give her good-good
And girl, I like to eat, I hope you like to cook, cook
Used to get the work from my cousin WupWup
What up, five? Free the guys out the woop-woop

[Chorus]
Teacher said, "You'll never make it"
Turned my textbook to a checkbook
I put food on the table
And I did that without a cookbook
I'm rich and they fucking hate it
And while they looking mad, I'm just looking good

[Verse 2]
Ayy, I feel like flexin'
Bitch, just call my phone, don't feel like texting
My Louis clothes is French, that's what I'm dressed in
Dior my cologne, she said my scent is her obsession
I became possessive soon as the money came in my possession
I'm selfish, no question
My alarm is set to every second, no restin'
My haters spend a lot of time with me, I'm they best friend
I'm they best friend
Go, best friend, go, best friend
Go, best friend, go, best friend
Go, best friend, yeah, go, ayy

[Chorus]
Teacher said, "You'll never make it," uh
Turned my textbook to a checkbook
I put food on the table
And I did that without a cookbook
I'm rich and they fucking hate it
And while they looking mad, I'm just looking good
Hah, ayy
And while they looking mad, I'm just looking good
