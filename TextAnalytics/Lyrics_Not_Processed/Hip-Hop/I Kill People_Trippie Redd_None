[Intro: Tadoe]
Ayy, what's poppin'?
You know how the fuck we bleed, man
We get money and kill people, man (OZ on the beat, yeah)
You hear me, man?
We don't rap beef, man
We slide, man, we drill people, man
Bomin' like Obama do and in traffic with a gun or two, man
I only speak facts and count racks, man, and send packs, man
Let's get it

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Shawty know I kill people, real people
From the trenches where it's real lethal, tote real regals
Big body, what's your build, boy? Ill boy
Nigga need to find his chill, boy, yeah
Shawty know I kill people, real people
From the trenches where it's real lethal, tote real regals
Big body, what's your build, boy? Ill boy
Nigga need to find his chill, boy
Foenem tweaking, we gon' show his ass for real, boy, huh, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bust him up, yeah
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bust him up (Ayy)
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bust him up

[Verse 1: Tadoe]
Totin' somethin' illegal
Hit your block with them guys, hop out, kill people
Got a Glock .45 and it's real lethal (Let's get it)
Bitch, you know we fry, we really kill people (Bang-bang)
Bitch, I'm with the gang, we catch a body gang (Gang-gang)
Bitch, we gangbang off in the lobby, man (Bang)
Catch a nigga lackin', it's a hobby, man
Pop him in the noggin, leave him sloppy, man
Hit your block, we gon' swerve shit (Skrrt-skrrt)

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Everyone same side for lil' bro, Ice Age all on my throat
How I ball, you think I went pro, I'm in the hood, Brisco
She show me her thong, Sisq√≥, she's hot and ready to go
I'm hungrier than a hippo, aim that thing high and get low
Got a new scope and it got zoom, and I'm in that yoom
Baby, I know you smell that fume
Just get down, you hear that boom
In the back of the 'Bach, and this bitch got room
Magazine got colored shells, half green, half blue
Smoking on that cook', someone bring me a pot
All these diamonds, I don't get hot
Young nigga really from them blocks
Ayy, pussy, here we come, if you ready or not
I'm on probation but I tote Glocks
Walk through court smellin' like pot

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Shawty know I kill people, real people
From the trenches where it's real lethal, tote real regals
Big body, what's your build, boy? Ill boy
Nigga need to find his chill, boy, yeah
Shawty know I kill people, real people
From the trenches where it's real lethal, tote real regals
Big body, what's your build, boy? Ill boy
Nigga need to find his chill, boy
Foenem tweaking, we gon' show his ass for real, boy, huh, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bust him up, yeah
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bust him up (Ayy)
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bust him up
