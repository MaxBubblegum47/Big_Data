[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Dear Mr.Ouija
Let 'em know who the boss is
So nigga you wanna get tossed in the river?
Nigga, put 'em in the mud see them pump blood, nigga no love
Get shown by the bone when I grab that crome
Then I honk your dome
Folla me roll stroll down East 1999
Gotta find these Row hoes
Think if you woke up and all of a sudden
Nigga you was off inna my hood?
I'm a, real thuggish nigga
So a, I would have to kill ya so die
I’d throw ya to the coffin
Pick up my pump dump chumps in the gutter pain
Nigga got ya fucked up? Bang!
Taking no shorts so fuck ya man
Claim my thang to slang them bloody bodies
Kill 'em all, send them hoes up in flames
Krayzie insane to the brain
Hey we slay niggas who think we play
Nigga, me deadly wid the gun
Machete be dipped in rum
Runnin' wid the gun steady buckin'
Leavin' them bodies dumped off in the alley for dead
I'm near, kill 'em all, mo' murda mo' murda
That's what Ouija said
Gotta put one in ya head, Bang

Mo murda, mo murda, mo murda
Mo murda, mo murda, mo murda

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again

Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again
Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again
Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Will I die of murda bloody mo murda
Living in the Land of the Heartless comin' up daily?
Until a me murda them all, I'm never gon' fall
So I'mma murda them baby
Get 'em up wid me thugs
See 'em on the corner and they slangin' them drugs
Givin' up shots out to the Glock Glock
Eighty eight to the ten five
Them killas be pumpin' them slugs
Niggas be fiendin' me daily
Me silence me twelve guage eruption
And I'm on a road to destruction
And steady be bustin' and bodies be bustin' me
Killa, with a buckshot, I'mma peel ya
Number one assassin's still the realer nigga
Down for my crime, niggas be down tryin' to stay to tha grind
Niggas is going insane taking a shot to the brain, and man
So call it a shame but what be the thang up offa this murda game?
And I'm feelin' not a bit remorseful
My twelve guage just so forceful
So playa hate when I'm in ya town
The nigga me bucking 'em down
And I'm giving up peace to the hustlas
Thugstas and twelve guage pumpstas
Drug 'em in gutters mo murda me style, now
Put 'em on the ground, lay down
Nigga check my thang the way that we swang
When I'm coming to serve ya
Wid the nine cocked and it's ready to pop
Lettin' off shots Layzie be screamin'
Mo murda mo murda

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again
Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again
Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again
Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again
Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again
Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again
Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again
Mo' murder, mo' murder, come, come again

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
Gotta kill, get 'em nowhere to run
Can't get away from my shotgun
Leavin' them bodies fucked up
Pump pump to the ground better leave it alone
Nigga wanna die when fuckin' wid
Mo Thug nigga we killed this bitch
Now you wanna catch some bang bang
Nigga wanna die when I let my nuts hang
What is it in me makes me feel like I gots ta murda ya?
You slip when I’m high, pullin' my ticket, nigga you die, soldier
Four killas we creepin' and comin' to hurt ya, mo murda
Better pack that five five

You don't wanna hear that Glock pop
When the Glock pop pop don't stop

Finger on the trigger Mo Thug let go

Watch Mo Thug Killas pump pump
Put 'em in the ground with his head blown gone

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
Eternally thugstas die
Will I die of murda now?
East ninety nine follow me grind
And all descending that body underground
We down to ride and everyone dies
And I'm, rolling with my killas
And all of my, thuggish ruggish niggas no lie
Chalkin' up bloody mo victims get 'em get 'em
That'll be little Ripsta, sinister killer
Y'all, put 'em in the river
Bodies shiver, FUCK that nigga
Hit 'em up inside, minds be blowin' I'm dumpin'
Remember me spray 'em slay 'em guage 'em layin 'em
All up off in a the coffin
Ready to fade 'em
To buck or to shoot with the twelve gauge eruptions
Creep out your seat would ya we come to stay
Found out none of my niggas was bluffing
For the love of the murda man the murda game
The same but a bang bang bang
Can't resist to bump you now pow run 'em all off
St Clair stays, down for the murda mo
Oh no, ho when a thugsta, stroll
Forty fours still pointed at the po-pos
Stop 'em drop 'em numb those 'til out cold they froze
You know, nigga we can't be bluffing
We bannnggg insane
When I put one to your temple
Mo murda then blow out ya brain

Mo murda mo murda
Come come again
Come bloody murda
('til fade)
