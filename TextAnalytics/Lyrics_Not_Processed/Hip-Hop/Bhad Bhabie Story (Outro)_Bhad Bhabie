[Intro]
Bitch, you're just mad
You think you know me and you don't
You don't know the real-life situations I've been through and what really goes on in my life
All you know is what you see
Don't believe everything you see on the internet
I'm just tired of everybody's opinion
Like y'all need to just hear the real story
Stop Bhad Bhabie

[Verse]
Finally reached out to my dad
We met at the mall on some other shit
Pissed off by his tattoos 'cause they had the names of his other kids
Like fuck me, I don't exist?
And you actin' like I'm s'posed to praise you?
My whole life you bought a pair of J's
Now you think I'm s'posed to say, "Thank you"?
That's when I knew I didn't need dad
My mom was pissed, I was sellin' pills
Couldn't even afford rehab
So she put me on Dr. ****
Got on stage and fuckin' blacked out
I look up, I'm in a ranch now
Did four months in solitary
Bet that y'all know it ain't a act now
Fuck it, hit a ho with no bars
I remember seein' Clay kill a staff member, Jimmy with a crowbar
They fled the scene in Alicia's car
Came home, jumped on the scene
I look online and I'm a fuckin' meme
Said I'd shoot my mom, I on't go fuckin' mean
You don't know what I seen
What the fuck you mean?
I took all the pain in my heart
Carried that shit to the charts
Even when they protested, I still got more blessings
I never dissed my mom to get some attention
Take a second and listen 'fore you give your dumbass opinion
You bitch

[Bridge]
You ain't seen nothin'
You don't know what I've been through
You haven't been there with me
So don't tell me what I went through
Don't tell me that I disrespect my mom for the fuck of it
Don't tell me I'm just bad for the fuck of it
Bitch you don't know my life
You don’t know what I been through
Unless you were there with me
You can't tell me nothing, ho

[Outro]
So, after 6 months of being on Dr. **** show
I finally got home (finally I was gone for so long)
And I got home from a ranch
And it was pretty miserable (fucking horrible)
I had no touch
Like I was not in touch with the internet
I did not know what was going on (at all)
To the real world
This place was far away from anything
Like no phones, no internet, no nothing
Like there wasn't even service there (nothing)
And a couple a weeks after being home
I finally decided that I wanted a meet with my best friend again (I just missed her and I wanted to see her again)
Someone who was not good for me at all
But I ended up going to her house to see her
And instantly, like I say it was the next day
'Cause she had slept over my house
We just got back to doing our old shit again
Smoking, like, like trying to finesse people for money
Like just doing really really dumb shit again (like really really dumb shit)
So since I was back outside the house
My mom decided to give me my phone
Because I was running around with Zandalee (take your phone back, Dani!)
She wanted to make sure that if something happened
I could be able to call her or whatever
So (just in case)
I logged into my Instagram
That I hadn’t been on for almost 7 months now
And (should of just stayed off of it)
Every all these people were following me
Everyone was commenting on my pictures
I had almost like 500,000 followers
And I was like "What the fuck is this?"
So I went on the explore page and there was a bunch of memes that was just my face that said "Catch Me Outside", and I was like "What the fuck is this?"
Like I had never-
Like I never even imagined that would happen (this shit's just so stupid)
Like I didn't even remember saying "Catch me outside"
That's the funniest thing
Like until I seen the bit from the show
I didn't even remember I said that
Like that shit was so irrelevant (this shit's so irrelevant)
Like it was just some random ass shit
So like a couple weeks later I had 600,000 followers
And it was crazy I was like
These people didn’t even know if it was my real account
Like I had never verified that it was my real shit so it was kind of crazy (they were just following it 'cause I guess people had liked me)
And then my
And then now this guy Adam had knocked on my door
And I was like "Can I help you like what do you want?"
And he was like
"Do you sing? Do you rap? Do you do anything?" (do you sing? do you rap? do you do anything?)
And he was like "well I wanna bring you to LA"
So me I was like "LA? Okay, cool!" (just trust me I'll make you a star)
So I went out there
I met Meechie and I met um Adam's management partner, Dan (I got you that check Barb, are we cool?)
And I stayed out there for a little bit
I did some interviews
And did some videos and stuff
And then I went back to Florida
And me and ZZ were just like walking like the streets
Where it's like going to the beach and stuff
And people kept taking pictures of me
And they kept like
We kept getting into fights
And like even some of ZZ’s friends got into fights about me
And I was getting sued for it I was getting blamed for it
So I then I hired my body guard Frank (hey I'm Frank)
Because he a big ass muhfucker
And he'll beat up everybody and they mama (just go fuck yourself)
So me and ZZ had went somewhere with one of her friends
And we ended up getting tattoos that night
And I didn't tell Adam I was gonna do it
Because I didn't think he would care like
I didn't think he really like gave a fuck
So I ended up getting a tattoo
The tattoo I have on my arm (it says family first)
And I went home and Adam had called me and he-
Or he FaceTimed me and he seen it
And he was like "Oh my god
You're going to fucking-
You're- you're- you're going back to LA
I can't have you out here doing this shit" (I can't have you out here doing this shit)
Like you're going to fuck yourself
You're going to get in trouble
This is not happening anymore
So before he had sent me back to LA
That day I met this girl Gabby
Who I then started dating or talking to for a couple months (I don't know why... I really don't know why)
And I was living with her in her trailer
And it was crazy like every time I'd go outside
Like there was all the neighborhood kids were surrounding like her house (everyone wanted to see me and take pictures)
And meanwhile while my dad was trying to get back in my life
And I didn't understand why
So I told him like no I don't want you to be in my life
Like 14 years and you haven't been here
Now all of a sudden
You see I have fans and followers and all this
And now you wanna get back in my life like no
It's not gonna work that way (nope)
He didn't like that so he went to press
He went to other cops (everywhere you could imagine)
He went to news stations
And other TV hosts and all this shit
Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (dumbass)
Talking all the shit he possibly could
Just trying to sabotage my whole career that wasn't a career yet (he just wanted money he just wanted his voice to be heard)
He wanted to make sure that every time I went to court
He went as well and tried to fuck shit up
He lied to the judge, told the judge I was suicidal
Told the judge I needed sexual ed classes
Like just a bunch of unnecessary bullshit
So fast forward fuck my dad (fuck his bitch pussy ass)
Then my manager was like "okay let's go to this recording studio
I have a few people I want you to meet"
So I went there, I met this A&R, Aton (what's good Bhad Bhabie?)
And he was like well we have this song
Like "we want you to record it
We want to see how you sound" (we gotta try this out, lets try this)
And it was just literally just
"Hi Bich, Hi Bich, Hi Bich"
It was not no other (it's just a hook right now but we'll work on this)
No other lyrics
It was just a beat and the words "Hi Bich"
So we made some verses and finished the hook (Yo, Aton, this shit is fire)
And Aton loved the song (Dan, Adam, Mike, Caren, call the lawyers)
And he was like "You know what?
You're gold, I wanna sign you"
