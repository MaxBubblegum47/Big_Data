O Cover wa now
Yeah, I’m D’banj
It’s like I’m just playing
B-I-G
Snoop Lion, I’m D’banj

[Hook: D'Banj]
I am not sorry I’m rich
I am sorry you broke
Yeah, don’t blame me
Blame it on the money
Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money
Blame it on the money
Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money
Blame it on the money
Money, Money, Money, Money, Money, Money
Blame it on the Money
Money, Money, Money
Kudi, Ego, Owo

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Four-five-fine women, that’s a copulation
Weed, Hennesey and me; what a combination
I had a bad day, tonight is a compensation
I don’t trust that bitch, I got the condom tested
Ow, paper chasing till I die
Stacking papers to the sky
Bro went from Murciélago to up in Lagos
Now Im with D’banj O
Now Im with D’banj O
So,So,So

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snoop Lion]
Walkin, Talking, Just like a king
Chest full of chains
Hand full of diamond rings
D’banj is the man with the Lion King
And money ain’t shit, we will buy anything
Blame it on my riches
Blame it on my bitches
???? and ???? and I live alone
And I get Shit
G-U-C-C-I, M-O-N-E-Y, P-U-S-S-Y
Keep em', Fresh and fly
I’m out the door and I count the dough
And I triple what you get
So pack along,just rap along
While I am stacking with these chicks
New????, New whips
Get rich motherfucker on any ????

[Hook]

[Verse 3: D'banj]
First imma' go pay my tithes
Next I am on a flight
Loving the life I live
No stressing, No fights
Got an estate to let
Maybachs to Jets
My 6 inch Rolex, HaHa, No contest
Oluwa lo dami, to gbe mi de bi ti mo de
Ma womi, ma fara we mi, O mo mi dele
Oluwa lo fun'mi lo la
Omo, don't blame me
Ti o ba wa sere, Ma gbe keke e lo
Ni'tori owo ni koko, obe ni rodo
Still making my own dough
Come get the koko, Giuseppe Zanotti
Sweeter than the toto, Banger Lee
O cover wa now
