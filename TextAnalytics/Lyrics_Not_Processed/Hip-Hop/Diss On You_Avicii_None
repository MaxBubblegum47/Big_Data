[Verse]
Yeah I'm an addict, can't help myself
I love too much I probably need some help
You see the trouble, yes I try to change
My heart is screaming out too loud
The love keeps drowning out my brain

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't pop or cry for you cause' we both know
You don't deserve my tears
Won't live or die for you
Cause' this is where I diss on you right here

[Chorus]
So ima' hit you where it hurts and that's your ego
You'll have to pray you make it out alive
Say fuck you and forget you just like Ceelo
And turn your heart to trash like you did mine
I'm gonna diss on you, if it's the last I do
I'm gonna diss on you, diss on you, diss on you

[Verse]
Yeah I'm an addict, can't help myself
I love too much I probably need some help
You see the trouble, yes I try to change
My heart is screaming out too loud
The love keeps drowning out my brain

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't pop or cry for you cause' we both know
You don't deserve my tears
Won't live or die for you
Cause' this is where I diss on you right here

[Chorus]
So ima' hit you where it hurts and that's your ego
You'll have to pray you make it out alive
Say fuck you and forget you just like Ceelo
And turn your heart to trash like you did mine
I'm gonna diss on you, if it's the last I do
I'm gonna diss on you, diss on you, diss on you
