[Chorus: Baby B]
I ain't tryna be soft right now, I just want you to know
How a nigga feelin' right now, girl I'm so throwed
Had a couple drinks or two, yeah
That's why I'm thinkin' about you
I got my mind on my money but my mind's on you right now
How would you feel if I slid through right now?
Had a couple drinks or two, yeah
That's why I'm thinkin' about you

[Verse 1: Yung Bleu]
Fuck a ride
I'ma fuck you good, I won't tell a lie
I'ma fuck you good 'til you good lie
No friends or no drugs, its just you and I
And if you ever leave it'd be suicide
You give me your wings, baby we can fly
I see through your soul, how you feel inside
So baby just turn off the light
I want you to slow wine for me
You need to give all your time to me
Put all your pride to the side for me
'Cause I ain't even

[Chorus: Baby B & 
Yung Bleu

I ain't tryna be soft right now, I just want you to know

How a nigga feelin' right now, girl I'm so throwed

How would you feel if I slid through right now?

That's why I'm thinkin' about you
(
I'm thinkin' about you

[Verse 2: Yung Bleu]
I heard you made love but you never had trust
I heard you got a man, I don't really give a fuck
I heard you get wet when you think about us
Ride this dick like a bus, I ain't come here to fuss
I need your energy (I need it), I need your energy (I need it)
I want to know if you in to me (Vandross)
Ayy-yay-yay-yay, fuckin' on the highway-yay-yay
Fuck you in the driveway-yay-yay
I know you like it my way-yay-yay

[Chorus: Baby B]
I ain't tryna be soft right now, I just want you to know
How a nigga feelin' right now, girl I'm so throwed
Had a couple drinks or two, yeah
That's why I'm thinkin' about you
I got my mind on my money but my mind's on you right now
How would you feel if I slid through right now?
Had a couple drinks or two, yeah
That's why I'm thinkin' about you

[Verse 3: Baby B]
Stuck on your ex and it's okay baby

Be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mine
