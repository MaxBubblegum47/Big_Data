[Intro: Cardi B, Al "T" McLaran & Megan Thee Stallion]
****** in this house
There's some ****** in this house
There's some ****** in this house
There's some ****** in this house (Hol' up)
I said certified freak, seven days a week
Wet and gushy, make that pullout game weak, woo (Ah)

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you dealin' with some wet and gushy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet and gushy
Give me everything you got for this wet and gushy

[Verse 1: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Beat it up, baby, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this cookie right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel, I'm kinda wild
Look at my mouth, look at my thighs
This water is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make me dream, make a stream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a (Ayy) runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your sh–, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that (Ah) (While you ride that)
You really ain't never gotta (Mwah) him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet and gushy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet and gushy
Pay my tuition just to kiss me on this wet and gushy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet and gushy (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep (Ah)
Need a Henny drinker, need a (Woo) smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Cookie A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him (Mmm), now he diabetic
I don't wanna (Mmm), I wanna (Woo)
I wanna (Ah), I wanna (Sco')
I want you to touch (Touch that, huh) that swing in the back of my
My talk game is fire, (Dasani) Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
The way that I spit and now he tryna sign me, woo

[Verse 4: Megan Thee Stallion]
Your honor, I'm a freak, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my (Ah), he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he (Ew) me and ask "Whose is it?"
When I ride the (Yeah), I'ma spell my name, ah

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you dealin' with some wet and gushy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet and gushy
Give me everything you got for this wet and gushy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet and gushy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet and gushy
I'm talkin' wap, wap, wap, that's some wet and gushy
Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet and gushy, huh

[Outro: Al "T" McLaran]
There's some ****** in this house
There's some ****** in this house
There's some ****** in this house
There's some ****** in this house
There's some ****** in this house
There's some ****** in this house
There's some ****** in this house
