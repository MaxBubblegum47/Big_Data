R.I.P we just killed the club
Took Patrón to the head, almost killed a thug
I'm so high I can't feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here
I don't feel the love
R.I.P, R.I.P
R.I.P, R.I.P
R.I.P we just killed the club
Took Patrón to the head, almost killed a thug

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I'm in a brand new drop top 'Rari with 3 bitches
Tired being in the middle of trial with 3 snitches
And I hit up every club in your city
Where niggas at?
I be in every club in the hood
Where niggas at?
Pull up, jump out stuntin' like I was Baby
On my cocaine cowboy shit, like in the 80's
Who the nigga think he is
Slick Rick or Dana Dane?
Think he Rakim or something, look at his chain
YSL, from head to toe, I'm Doug E Fresh
Looking like I came to play, Mitchell and Ness
Any nigga with a watch like that
He need attention
Your man don't ball out like that
You need to bench him

R.I.P we just killed the club
Took Patrón to the head, almost killed a thug
I'm so high I can't feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here
I don't feel the love
R.I.P, R.I.P
R.I.P, R.I.P
R.I.P we just killed the club
Took Patrón to the head, almost killed a thug

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I'm gone, don't know where I'm going
Pockets on extra big, they're on Samoan
Got some bad bitches all in my section
Just let some more in
And every nigga came in with me'll kick your door in
Roll up, pass it around like we Jamaican
Whole pounds strapped up in this bitch like we some Haitians
She got good head, good brains, good education
I'm drunker than a motherfucker, here's the situation:
1:45 am, the knob broken
By the time a nigga get to the crib, the mall open
Man the nerve of this high-ass bitch
She on the Molly
She said she she want me to call her Ms. Berry
She think she Halle

R.I.P we just killed the club
Took Patrón to the head, almost killed a thug
I'm so high I can't feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here

R.I.P, R.I.P
R.I.P, R.I.P
R.I.P we just killed the club
Took Patrón to the head, almost killed a thug

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Got a pocket full of dead prez
Attached to your girl like a .jpeg
Party scene turn to a murder scene
Keep shitting on niggas, need potty train
Turn up, collard green
I'm on gasoline and
I'm on that promethazine
Life ain't nothing but a G thing
Switch lanes, get brain, hand down her g-string
I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
You fuck with me, Ill put my foot in your ass
I got a million in stash, I stack my money so tall
That you might need a giraffe
When you was counting this cash, nigga!

R.I.P we just killed the club

I'm so high I can't feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here
I don't feel the love
R.I.P, R.I.P
R.I.P, R.I.P
R.I.P we just killed the club
Took Patrón to the head, almost killed a thug
