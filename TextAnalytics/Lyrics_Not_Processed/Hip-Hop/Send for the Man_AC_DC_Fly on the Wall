You
You wanted love

[Verse 1]
You wanted love
Dirty, dirty love
Don't want lust
Just a little love

[Pre-Chorus]
You want a bad reputation
You want to better your score
I got the qualifications
I can open any door
(Ooh, yeah)

[Chorus]
Send for the man (Yeah)
Send for the man (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
You're like a dream
You're dirty, low and mean
You're good enough to eat, yeah
You're sticky, hot and sweet

[Pre-Chorus]
Need a shot of rhythm and lovin'
You make a black sheep a ram
This ainâ€™t no gun in my pocket
I got the goods in my hand
Yeah
Send for the man

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Send for the man (Yeah)
Send for the man (Yeah)
Send for the man (Yeah)
Ah, you gotta keep away from the decadent man
Send for the man (Yeah)
You want a good time? (Yeah)
(Yeah)
Send for the man (Yeah)
Send for the man (Yeah)
(Yeah)
