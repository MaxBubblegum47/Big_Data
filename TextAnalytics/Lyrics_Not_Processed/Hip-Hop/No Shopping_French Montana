[Chorus: French Montana]
Sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank (Yeah)
Sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank (Yeah, woo)
All about the mula, all about the mula (Woo)
Word to the bird, I ain't never take her fur shoppin' (Ayy, woo)

[Verse 1: French Montana & 
DJ Khaled
]
Runnin' through them keys way before Khaled (
Another one
)
Runnin' with the pushas way before Malice (Woo)
Word to the five, I'm the one like four minus
Caught her off the rebound, Ben Wallace, gave her four dollars (Haan)
Sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank (Woo)
Sippin' on the drank, I ain't tryna think (Woo, ayy, ayy)
When it get hot, bodies start droppin'
Hit the strip club, told them hoes gon' get the moppin' (Skrrt skrrt, woo)
Word to Diddy, we Cirocin' (How we rockin')
Word to Biggie, we'll be Pac-in' (We be Pac-in', what?)
I just bought Selena crib, I'm poppin'
I just told Drizzy, "Let me take Serena to the tropics"
Sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank (Drank)
Sippin' on the drank, I ain't tryna think (Woo)
Sittin' high, 6 God cover (Woo)
Tell them hoes get low, 6 God comin'

[Chorus: French Montana]
Sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank (Yeah)
Sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank (Yeah, woo)
All about the mula, all about the mula (Woo)
Word to the bird, I ain't never take her fur shoppin'

[Verse 2: Drake & 
French Montana
]
Pump, pump, pump it up (
Skrrt
)
She got a good head on her, but I pump it up (
Skrrt
)
I'm not a one hit wonder, they know all my stuff (
Haan
)
You let me turn into the nigga that you almost was
I done seen a lot of shit and I done been in things (
Haan
)
And I never started nothin', I just finish things
And I'm sell off like the man that brought me in this thing (
Woo
)
How you out here celebratin' like the winnin' team?
No, calm down, calm down
Shit ain't how you think it is, take a look around (
Skrrt
)
I'm supposed to be on a vacation right now
But I'm home wildin', word to DJ Khaled
Back with another one
I'm steady droppin' bombs on your head top (
Haan
)
Been that way since I could make your bed rock (
Haan
)
I'm on Bloor where you can't shop (
Skrrt
)
Bitch, I just rapped and it went pop
Next move better than my last move (
Haan
)
Your next move can't erase your past moves
Took her out once she got attached to him
Ring, ring, click, I'll get back to 'em (
Woo
)
You don't really want the views
You don't want a snapshot of things goin' on with the crew
You don't wanna hear Not Nice did thirteen
And did another two for some other shit he didn't do (
Woo
)
Last week, boy dem runnin' in the room  (
Haan
)
This week sold one-point-two (
Haan
)
Yeah, it's a Boucheron, baby boy
Yeah, and I know Taraji like I'm baby boy (
Haan

And I fuck with Weezy and I'm Baby, boy (
Haan

Yeah, we the Army, better yet the Navy, boy (
Haan
)

[Chorus: French Montana & 
Drake
]
Yeah, sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank
Yeah, sippin' on the drank, I ain't tryna think

All about the mula, all about the mula (Woo)
Word to the bird, I ain't never take her fur shoppin' (Woo, ayy)
Sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank
Sippin' on the drank, I ain't tryna think
All about the mula, all about the mula
Word to the bird, I ain't never take her fur shoppin'

[Outro: French Montana]
The birds want rings and tings, you know
But we'll never take the bird shoppin', you know
Still, you already dun know
Big up, Six God
Haan, skrrt, skrrt
