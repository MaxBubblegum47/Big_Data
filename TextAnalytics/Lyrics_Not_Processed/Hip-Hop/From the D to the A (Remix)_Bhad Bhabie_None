[Verse]
Fuck the opps, run a lil hoe out her socks
I got money like I'm trappin', but I been left the block though
Bitches hear I'm hangin' where they stay
Now they scared, wanna lock doors, runnin' up this place
I ain't worried bout no mad hoes, I ain't worried bout no hoe
All these brands wanna give me checks, I put something on it 50 bands, not a penny less
Why you bitches penniless, you rode in a Bentley yet?
You still riding coach now, bitch, I'm on the private jet
Down with the win now I'm getting to it
Got deals on the line, pssh, bitch you stupid
600 hundreds, what's that, 60 bands?
Keep adding up now this knot can't fit in my hands
You cannot relate, I been eating good, you can't find a plate
Talking shit off in my comments but my bank account is straight
Somebody tell these hoes to get a life
I'm on my "spend whatever" shit, so I don't pay attention to the price
Like, ten bands, fifty bands, got all kind of dough
Garage feelin' haunted, ain't no spirits, I just copped a Ghost
Hair stand up on my arm 'cause my wrist cold
Take my Rollie off before the fame make that bitch fold
Sit these hoes on they pockets just for talking reckless
She a finesse, easy for her to cop a check, bitch
Smack her down then it's over, yeah, that neck done
Lesson learned, now go tell your friends I'm not the one
I was 6 figure rich, now I'm 7 up
Broke hoe, your record deal worth 11 bucks
You scared while I'm in town here's the addy, you should pop up
Spend the money like I never lift the pedal up
Got popped for blowing gas after court
People tryna violate me so I keep my convo short
I don't know you hoes, I ain't tryna hang with ya
I'm just tryna get these bands, ain't here to play no games wit ya
Tats in my skin, racks in my purse
He was talkin' down, I made his girl put it in reverse
Dealing with probation, got no life and shit, it could be worse
Five lawyers handling my case, it keep me free to work
My ex bestie leaked my number and my addy
Sharing info with the courts tryna partner with my daddy
But I'm still roaming free, when you see me, bitch, don't dap me
Or I'll be on yo heels, you better run like a track meet
