[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
Ooh, Bobby raps and makes beats
Haven't slept alone in a minute
Like to push my own limits
This something that I've grown into, yeah
CHASETHEMONEY, CHASETHEMONEY
Think we too alone
You think I'm lying to you, yup
I've been lying to you, yup

[Chorus: Billie Eilish and 
Valee
]
Gettin' kinda hard to breathe
With these hands all over me
Somethin' you don't wanna see
So I think I'm gonna keep on lyin' to ya (
What?
)
Yup, I'm lying to you
I'ma just keep fuckin' lying to you (Haha, 
yeah
)

[Verse 2: Valee and 
Billie Eilish
]
I try to protect her
You know I respect her
I'm not interested to leave my Sara Bellum
I can sense you jealous
I got that impression
I am not invested
You askin' them questions
You Inspector Gadget
I change my perspective
You got inconvenient
I change my direction
I feel like Mulan
I've seen my reflection
I'm tryin' to move on
I hear your objection
I see you addicted
You got an obsession
You misunderstood me
Call me misconception
You over committed
You need to relax, man
Don't care 'bout your feelings
But I'm feeling sneaky
Yeah
Yup

[Chorus: Billie Eilish and 
10k Caash
]
Gettin' kinda hard to breathe
With these hands all over me
Somethin' you don't wanna see
So I think I'm gonna keep on lyin' to ya (
Woo
)
Yup, I'm lying to you
And I'ma just keep fuckin' lying to you (Haha)
Aye, skrt

[Verse 3: 10k.Caash]
No, I don't trust her (Woo)
She just want my charger (Skrt, skrt)
Turnt up on my Swajjur (Skrt)
Eat dick, stop the chatter (Mmm)
She's such a liar (Liar)
But the pussy fire (Hot, hot)
I got Swajjur, in my Swajjur bag
Your bitch gobble-gobble like Pac-Man
Do what I want, you do what you can (Huh)
Life sucks, better steal what you can (Brr, skrt)
Not my charger, you better watch your hands (Bitch)
Lied to the bitch 'bout fuckin' her friend (Huh)
Welp, I might as well fuck again (Haha)
Damn, she caught me lying again
