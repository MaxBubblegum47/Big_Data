[Chorus]
How to find a new hoe?
I ran out of options
You ain't gotta take it there
All you do is pop shit
All your niggas told on you
You don't even pop shit
Get the bag on touchdown
I like playing offence
All my places locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in

{Verse}
She fuck up a price tag
That my lil woah
Pick it up, it ain't fair
Get it then I go go
Niggas try to hit a stain
But they moving so slow
Wylin' at a red light
Cannon so they won't know
Oh baby you stupid bad
Know that bae
In your bag
Know that bae
Put your pass on roller skates
Put your [?] on roller skates
She got a little attitude
You swear you so classy
I don't wanna leave her lone
Cause the pussy taste like candy

[Chorus]
How to find a new hoe?
I ran out of options
You ain't gotta take it there
All you do is pop shit
All your niggas told on you
You don't even pop shit
Get the bag on touchdown
I like playing offence
All my places locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
