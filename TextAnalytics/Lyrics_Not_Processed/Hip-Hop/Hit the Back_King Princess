[Verse 1]
I need you to search my clothing
Pat me down and feel the molding
'Cause underneath this table feels so good to me
And I need you to be my motor
And run me 'til I can't go further
'Cause every turn you take is just exciting me

[Chorus]
And ain't I the best you had?
And I'll let you throw it down, hit the back
Tell me I need respect
And you know that I'm around, I'm your pet
Ain't I the best you had?
And I'll let you throw it down, hit the back
Tell me you need respect
'Cause you know that I'm around, I'm your pet

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm a star, but you're an icon
A dirty girl with lots of passion
Staring at my fingers while I talk to you
And I don't care if you degrade me
'Cause after all, you are my safety
And everything you touch just feels like yours to me

[Chorus]
Ain't I the best you had?
And I'll let you throw it down, hit the back
Tell me you need respect
'Cause you know that I'm around, I'm your pet
Ain't I the best you had?

[Bridge]
(Ain't I the best you've ever had?)
It's really been nice to meet ya, babe
(Take my heart and hit the back)
(Ain't I the best you had?)
I think that I really need ya, baby
(Ain't I the best you've ever had?)
I think that I really need ya, baby
(Take my heart and hit the back)

[Chorus]
Ain't I the best you had?
And I'll let you throw it down, hit the back
Tell me you need respect
'Cause you know that I'm around, I'm your pet

[Outro]
Ain't I the best you had?
(Ain't I the best you've ever had?)
Ain't I the best you had?
(Take my heart and hit the back)
Ain't I the best you had?
(Ain't I the best you've ever had?)
(Take my heart and hit the back)
