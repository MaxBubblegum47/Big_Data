[Intro]
Damn, Pliz
There go your tag

[Verse 1]
They tried to do it like this, so I did it like that
Realest *** *****, won't say **** back
If I ever took an L, we gon' run that back
I ain't stoppin' 'til it shoot or is me not that?
Tight jeans, got a lil' back out
Got a comb, had to put the lil’ track up
Too close to me, you need to backup
Who you 'posed to be? Don't make me act up

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't talk to me, talk to my CashApp
I'm still a petty *** *****, I ain't past that
I'm still a bratty *** *****, you can catch that
I'm still a gangsta *** *****, where the mask at?

[Chorus]
I got plenty jewels on my wrist
I got plenty dudes on my line
I got all this money to go get (Go get, go get, go get, go get)
Can't nobody do it like me (Do it like this)
Do it like me (Do it likе this)
Do it like me (Do it like this)
Do it likе me (Do it like this)
Can't nobody do it like me (Do it like this)
Do it like me (Do it like this)
Do it like me (Do it like this)
Do it like me (Do it like this)

[Verse 2]
Bad *****, photogenic
Bust down, flooded Patek
Iced out, automatic
Lifestyle, gotta have it
Fendi on my ******* jacket
Wore it once, now you can have it
I ain't never been a’ average
Trust me, I'm a ******* savage

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't never met a chick like me before
Got a whole lotta drip and a bankroll
Penthouse at the top where you can't go
I ain't got no time for no stank **

[Chorus]
I got plenty jewels on my wrist
I got plenty dudes on my line
I got all this money to go get (Go get, go get, go get, go get)
Can't nobody do it like me (Do it like this)
Do it like me (Do it like this)
Do it like me (Do it like this)
Do it like me (Do it like this)
Can't nobody do it like me (Do it like this)
Do it like me (Do it like this)
Do it like me (Do it like this)
Do it like me (Do it like this)
