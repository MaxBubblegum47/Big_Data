[Hook: Big Sean]
Oh God
She gon' have it
She gon' keep it
She said she gon' have it
She gon' have it
She gon' keep it
Aww shit there go our little secret

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
It was all good just a week ago
Worst problem that I had was that my speakers blown
In my whip, fuck it I got me a job
I feel rich I ain't gotta sell weed I'm legit
Shit I seen her pull up in a parking lot first
Thought I had was hotties, hoes didn't find where I work
Then her friend, "Hey go girl go tell 'em"
I knew she was mad as hell when that bitch said, "Tell em'"
All because I hit and stop textin'
But before I finish that thought she told me she pregnant (The fuck?)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
She like I ain't try to argue with it, I know you got bitches
I just hit you back because I'm moving forward with this shit
Really my mom and my aunt was my father figures
I just figured with fathers it might make all the difference
I'm sayin', "Is it mine? Do we gotta get Maury involved with it?"
"How many niggas you think that I done had all in it? Stupid nigga"
I don't even know why I'm sayin shit
I hate to be on that all-nigga's-the-same shit
But shit I'm saying girl it is what it is
We talking kids with a kid and a crib with a crib
But I ain't tryin' to leave believe
I would be a good dad just like my dad was to me
And I can't tell you to kill that shit my mom had me
And I can't tell you to keep a shit we ain't ready
Now I gotta tell my family to pull up a seat
Cause I planted a seed and about to extend the family tree
And we so stressed out that I called a weed man
Cause I prolly gotta bout a whole family tree

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean (Common)]
Granny called my mom sayin' I have demons
I heard my parents talkin' in the next bed
(To raise Sean we damn near had to give a left leg
What the hell they teachin' these kids in sex ed?)
Everything that I forgot while getting the best head
I know couples who took classes cause they couldn't
I know ball players who pay strippers so they wouldn't
What really make me feel like I ain't shit
Is that I still gotta tell my main chick

[Hook]

[Outro]
Fuck, there go our little secret
She gon' have it
She gon' keep it
9 months later shit we gon' see it
Damn, aww shit
