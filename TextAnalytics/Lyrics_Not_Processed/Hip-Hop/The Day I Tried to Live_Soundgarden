[Verse 1]
I woke the same as any other day
Except a voice was in my head
It said, "Seize the day, pull the trigger
Drop the blade and watch the rolling heads"

[Chorus 1]
The day I tried to live
I stole a thousand beggars' change
And gave it to the rich
The day I tried to win
I dangled from the power lines
And let the martyrs stretch

[Post-Chorus]
Singing, one more time around might do it
One more time around might make it
One more time around might do it
One more time around I might make it
The day I tried to live, yeah

[Verse 2]
Words you say
Never seem to live up to the ones inside your head
The lives we make
Never seem to ever get us anywhere but dead

[Chorus 2]
The day I tried to live
I wallowed in the blood and mud
With all the other pigs

[Post-Chorus]
Singing, one more time around might do it
One more time around might make it
One more time around might do it
One more time around I might make it
The day I tried to live, yeah
I tried

[Verse 3]
I woke the same as any other day
You know why I should have stayed in bed

[Chorus 3]
The day I tried to win
I wallowed in the blood and mud
With all the other pigs
And I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (One more time around)

[Post-Chorus]
Singing, one more time around might do it
One more time around might make it
One more time around might do it
One more time around I might make it
The day I tried to live, yeah

[Outro]
Just like you
Just like you
One more time around
One more time around
