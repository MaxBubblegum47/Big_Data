[Intro]
Do what I say
Bills in her name
Teach you the game
Teach you the game
Nigga a lame
Thing in his face
Give you some fame
I need a ho that's gon' do what I want
Roll up a blunt, smoke on a blunt
Lighten it up, pass it to cuz
Never say that we came, rob us a bank

[Verse 1]
Like stop, give me everything you got
First nigga move gettin' popped like a soda
Fuck robbin', we gon' run this bag up
Since I been trappin', all she wanna do is hold her
Flight after flight, I ain't spendin' no night
Yeah, this water is tight, sending pounds like a kite
If you try take a bite, come here to fight
We gon' put you in chalk, want to explain

[Chorus]
I need a ho that's gon' do what I say
Put these bills in her name
I'ma teach you the game
She gon' teach you the game
Your last nigga a lame
Put that thing in his face
That'll give you some fame
Need a ho that's gon' do what I want
Roll up a blunt, smoke on a blunt
Lighten it up, pass it to cuz
Never say that we came, we can rob us a bank
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde

[Verse 2]
She count
Fifty thousand for a nigga, was just now
Gettin' mad at every nigga like I won't
Wife you, take it 'way from here, won't see you
Cryin', wipe away the tears, don't get shook
Girl, you're with me, ain't no fear, I put you
Up, you shining, chandelier
And I drink Henny, never drinkin' beer
To myself, start to think I'm seeing clear like
Where was you at? Textin' me back, damn, it took too long
What about us? Wish I hadn't never made that song
But I did though, now I know why I think this way
Doin' music, now she listen to what I got to say, like

[Chorus]
I need a ho that's gon' do what I say
Put these bills in her name
I'ma teach you the game
She gon' teach you the game
Your last nigga a lame
Put that thing in his face
That'll give you some fame
Need a ho that's gon' do what I want
Roll up a blunt, smoke on a blunt
Lighten it up, pass it to cuz
Never say that we came, we can rob us a bank
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde

[Outro]
Like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Girl, we like Bonnie and Clyde
Ho that's gon' do what I say
Bills in her name
Teach you the game
Teach you the game
Nigga a lame
Thing in his face (Put his ass in a box)
Need a ho that's gon' do what I want
Roll up a blunt, smoke on a blunt
Lighten it up, pass it to cuz
Say that we came, rob us a bank
Girl, we like
Girl, we like
Girl, we like
Girl, we like
Girl, we like
Girl, we like
Yeah
