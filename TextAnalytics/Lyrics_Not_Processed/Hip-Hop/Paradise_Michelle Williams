[Verse, Tatum]
Dancer in the night
Playing with my eyes
Velvet tongue so sweet
Say anything you like

Crush me with the lie
And tell me once or twice
That love is paradise
That love is paradise

Everything was love
Everything wil be love
Everything has been love
Everything would be love
Everything would have been love
Ahh...that was it. The truth at last
Everything would have been love
The huge eye which would have become an immense fear was gently breathing only without an eye, nor a sphere
But our great wonderful animal, covered in little waving legs like hairs
Waving, oh so gently as if they were underwater
All should be went and all should be well said that ocean
So the place of reconciliation existed after all
Not like a little, not wholly uncovered, but flowing everywhere and being everything
I had only to will it and I would be
For spirit is omnipotent, only I never knew it
And being able to walk on the Earth
I could forgive. I could be forgiven
I could forgive. Perhaps that was the whole of it after all
Perhaps being forgiven is just forgiving and no one had ever told me
There was nothing else needful
Just to forgive
Forgiving equals being forgiven
The secret of the universe
Do not whatever you do forget it
The past was folded out and in the twinkle of an eye and everything had been changed
And made beautiful and good

[Verse Repeat, Tatum)
