[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Ok I think I think I think I think I'm the baddest
We got all the bottles they got all the glasses
I'm prolly with yo girlfriends cause they got all the asses
Burning all this paper you should try and catch the ashes
I'm in my section poppin something off
In the bank or a bitch droppin something off
Wo-wo-work ho make me throw this paper out looking like a paper route
Dick her down lay her out didn't have to take her out
Thinkin I'm a do her right look left and fake her out, haaa
Cause I get back to the money
If I ever leave boomerang back to the money

[Chorus: Big Sean]
All I think about is money and sex fuckin and checks
In this life time you need to run and get left
M m money and sex fuckin and checks
In this life time you need to run and get left
Now I'm finnaly gettin rich proly in ya bitch
And if I there I'm proly getting rich cause all I
Of is money and sex fuckin and checks
Money and sex fuckin and checks

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I say I feel I feel I feel I feel I'm the best
Got the game on bubble like the vest, piece hangin on my
Chain chain hangin on my chest chest
The game is on lock money power and respect
I started in the streets choppin rocks in a gravel pit
Went from not having to having it
From dreaming to grabing it
With only top ramen noodles up in my cabinet
Now I'm killing this motherfucker, beating and stabbing it
Speaking of stabbing it where ya bitch she just text me
She say she in the room rockin something sexy
No disrespect g cause I ain't even trying to but send her to my room if you see her before I do

[Chorus: Big Sean]
All I think about is money and sex fuckin and checks
In this life time you need to run and get left
M m money and sex fuckin and checks
In this life time you need to run and get left
Now I'm finnaly gettin rich proly in ya bitch
And if I there I'm proly getting rich cause all I
Of is money and sex fuckin and checks
Money and sex fuckin and checks

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Bitch I'm on a money making marathon
Welcome to the terror dome
Journey of my life, The whole world is my carry on
I took I vow that I'm forever getting payed
Always heard that lifes a beach so I'm forever getting laid
If money equals power then I'm a fucken generator
Man that spotlight bright
So watch me center stage it and do it, yo girl wanna do it
Damn I look good, but you already knew it
Can't remember the last time I seen my bed sets
Or the last time I had bed sex
I'm in the backseat, getting my dick wet
I fell asleep getting brain, that's a head rest
Last night I hit the bar said I want it all
And today I said the same thing at the mall
Come through in yo city do the same thing tomorrow
Gettin money and I can't say the samething for ya'll
