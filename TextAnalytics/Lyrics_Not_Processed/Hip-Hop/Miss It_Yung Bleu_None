[Chorus]
I'm sitting here reminiscing how I would kiss you baby
I gave you top of the line
, I know you miss it baby
I got a lot on my mind, why don't you visit baby
If you could turn back the time you would've listened baby
You would've listened to the words, I swear
Your shit wouldn't be out on the curb, I swear
I swear to God you had some nerve, I swear
But this for listening to them birds out there
I put up with your bullshit for the last time
Who would've thought that when we fucked it was the last time
It was the last time
Who would've thought that when we fucked it was the last time

[Verse 1]
I got issues, yeah I got problems with commitment baby
I apologized to you I should've listened baby
I wasn't in love with them hoes, I was just pimping baby
I knew my part, knew my role, I wasn't slipping baby
I regret it, you know I do, nobody perfect
Used to dress you in Jimmy Choo because you worth it
You ain't here when I needed you, what was your purpose?
Say you love me, say you trust me, now you cursin'
Half the time I'm at the studio writing verses
Tryna get away from this drama I'm submerged in
Now you on my social media and you lurkin'
You wanna be a detective, but be my girlfriend
I'm too good of a nigga to deserve this
Grab my car keys to the 'Maro now I'm swervin
I'm too good of a nigga to derseve this
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I'm sitting here reminiscing how I would kiss you baby
I gave you top of the line, I know you miss it baby
I got a lot on my mind, why don't you visit baby
If you could turn back the time you would've listened baby
You would've listened to the words, I swear
Your shit wouldn't be out on the curb, I swear
I swear to God you had some nerve, I swear
But this for listening to them birds out there
I put up with your bullshit for the last time
Who would've thought that when we fucked it was the last time
It was the last time
Who would've thought that when we fucked it was the last time

[Verse 2]
Love me like no other, you don't need no one
All them bitches hating, don't believe no one
Said love me like no other, you don't need no one
All them bitches hating, don't believe no one
I know your game, I know your game
I know your game, I know your game
It ain't the same, it ain't the same
Baby say my name, baby say my name
I wanna take you way out to the island baby
I wanna lick you down and have you smiling baby
Girl you know when we on that drink we wylin' baby
I'ma take you on a flight, let me be your pilot baby

[Chorus]
I'm sitting here reminiscing how I would kiss you baby
I gave you top of the line, I know you miss it baby
I got a lot on my mind, why don't you visit baby
If you could turn back the time you would've listened baby
You would've listened to the words, I swear
Your shit wouldn't be out on the curb, I swear
I swear to God you had some nerve, I swear
But this for listening to them birds out there
I put up with your bullshit for the last time
Who would've thought that when we fucked it was the last time
It was the last time
Who would've thought that when we fucked it was the last time
