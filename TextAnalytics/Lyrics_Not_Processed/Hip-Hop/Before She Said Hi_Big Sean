[Verse 1: Mario]
I'm sick and tired of friends with benefits
Been through too many goodbyes
And I can't say that I been so innocent
Cause I told my share of lies
But it seems like whenever I get closer
Love pushes me away
And just when I thought my chances were over
I stared my future in the face

[Hook: Mario]
I looked an angel in the eye
And since then I've been paralyzed
Something told me she'd be mine
And I knew it before she said hi (before she said hi)
Hi (hi) [x2]
And I knew it before she said hi
Hi (hi) [x2]
And I knew it before she said hi

[Verse 2: Mario]
I made a lot of broken promises
I had no respect for words
And I thought that I'd gotten all that I'm against
Until I ran into her
She whispers to me and it pulls me closer
Now I can't stay away (no I can't stay away)
And now I feel like all my pain is over
I stared my future in the face

[Hook: Mario]
I looked an angel in the eye
And since then I've been paralyzed
Something told me she'd be mine
And I knew it before she said hi (before she said hi)
Hi (hi) [x2]
And I knew it before she said hi
Hi (hi) [x2]
And I knew it before she said hi

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Now she had all of my ex's along with my best's
One night stands and girls that I've next'd
Very big breast's, I hand 'em prom dresses
Well that would be a very long guest list
To the party in my pants they stepped in
Vegas on the map, girl forget Texas
Thought I was made to live young and reckless
But since I saw you, I'm tryin' to find where my breath is
And I already feel gone, it ain't cause what I'm sippin' on
I seen you in my dream girl right next to B
You a dream girl, Christina Millian
And what you got is Hurricane Katrina
To swim inside of you, I'ma probably need FEMA
I ain't tryna' lose love like I play Serena
So me and you should not let shit come between us at all

[Hook: Mario]
I looked an angel in the eye
And since then I've been paralyzed
Something told me she'd be mine
And I knew it before she said hi (before she said hi)
Hi (hi) [x2]
And I knew it before she said hi
Hi (hi) [x2]
And I knew it before she said hi
