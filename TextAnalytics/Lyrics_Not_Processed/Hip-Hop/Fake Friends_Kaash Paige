[Intro]
Talkin' 'bout that fake shit
Oh, that fake love, that slippery slimy, that snake shit
But I can't let up
But I can't let up

[Verse 1]
5 o'clock on the dot, I hear my cell phone
Like, Kaash, what's up, what is B on?
Like let me let you up
Girl, you won't believe what I Just heard
What you hear? What you know?
Bro, she a hoe, she on the other line
Please don't let her know
Just keeping it real with you
So this bitch don't get comfortable
Oh, she sorry now
Girl, you know you let me down
Hit you when I'm back in town
'Cause I heard that you been gettin' 'round
Now you worthless
I hope she was worth it
Not saying that we perfect
You not the one that's hurting

[Chorus]
Fake friends on a row (Fake friends)
Switching up, cut 'em off (Switchin' up)
Talkin' 'bout that fake shit ('Bout that fake shit)
Oh, that fake love, that slippery slimy, that snake shit (That snake shit)
Fake friends on a row
Switching up, cut 'em off
Talkin' 'bout that fake shit
Oh, that fake love, that slippery slimy, that snake shit

[Verse 2]
Talkin' 'bout that fake shit
When you're negative and complaining with the same shit
That's your prerogative
Be kicking it with them lame chicks
And I know what time it is
When you hit me with that lane switch
Now I'm the trending topic
Watch my back 'cause niggas, they be plottin'
I mow the lawn, there's still snakes in my garden
And I been bit before, so gotta remain cautious

[Chorus]
Fake friends on a row (Fake friends)
Switching up, cut 'em off (Switchin' up)
Talkin' 'bout that fake shit ('Bout that fake shit)
Oh, that fake love, that slippery slimy, that snake shit (That snake shit)
Fake friends on a row
Switching up, cut 'em off
Talkin' 'bout that fake shit
Oh, that fake love, that slippery slimy, that snake shit (Snake shit)
