[Intro]
It's only Cass’ on it, you dig?
That boy Cassius

[Chorus]
I just been ballin' out every season
Know it's some niggas I left in the bleachers
I just been married to double cup
I got to pour me a four inside another liter
Tie up the bands and then run it up
I got to put the new bales inside of the freezer
Back at the trap I was ducking them people
Ducking them birds sending out them eagles
All of my diamonds gone buss out the meter
I’m dripping water nigga, Aquafina
Damn that bitch cappin' if she think I need her
Hit it one time and then I got to leave her
I'm a real street nigga
Gotta keep it a rack with my people
Turn the whole squad to bosses
I can't be kickin' shit like I'm Adidas

[Verse 1]
Young nigga pullin' up inside the Bentley truck
I just be poppin' shit like hot grease
I remember days sitting at the trap
’Bout to call the plug gotta cop three
Looked up to Pablo Escobar, Money Meech, and Chapo
That’s my top three
Bitch I was serving the sidewalk
Then I copped the drop hopped in the streets
You can't name a young nigga that’s hot as me
All my niggas do murders and robberies
Got about 20 racks in the Robin Jeans
Niggas thinking I won off the lottery
When I hop in the push start with the pound
Niggas know that it ain't no stopping me
Outta town champ like Mayweather
Got a new crib off the boxing ring
Put the new Forgiatos on the Jeep
Run up 30 in a week
I just fuck her I don't keep
.45 Under the pillow
45,000 in the sheets
I want the bag nigga
I can't trust no ho if I know she ain’t married to me
Bitch I done got this shit up out the streets
Red gut period blood on my seats

[Chorus]
I just been ballin' out every season
Know it's some niggas I left in the bleachers
I just been married to double cup
I got to pour me a four inside another liter
Tie up the bands and then run it up
I got to put the new bales inside of the freezer
Back at the trap I was ducking them people
Ducking them birds sending out them eagles
All of my diamonds gone buss out the meter
I'm dripping water nigga, Aquafina
Damn that bitch cappin' if she think I need her
Hit it one time and then I got to leave her
I'm a real street nigga
Gotta keep it a rack with my people
Turn the whole squad to bosses
I can't be kickin' shit like I'm Adidas

[Verse 2]
Rap shit
I ain't got to cap shit
I've been gettin' cheese like I'm Velveeta
I'm in a two seater with two bad bitches
Black and white, I'm finna have a zebra
She want to ride in the back
Cause I've been having them racks
I ain't showing
She say I ain't got them racks
Thought you knew me better than that
But they ain't knowing
She say my VVS's so annoying
I bought a coupe to spoil her
She want to look out the roof in the morning
YSL got her a new persona
I want to ball like a triple-double nigga
Larry Bird with the racks
Livin' my best life, shorty
You can't never get attached
Went to the plug got a couple P's
Then I Randolph, like Zach
We been sellin' in the projects
Like it's the New Jack City
All my bitches got ass and titties
Got to hop on top the bag and get it
She call me 'cause her main nigga don't beat it up
He something like a pacifist
All a nigga do is sniff her the check
Open her mouth put the dick in her neck
Blue rags bitches crippin' the set
I've been trapping got to get a Patek
Bitch I'm rich I can't be livin' in debt
She won't be my bitch
I can't fuck with the pets
Her best friend end up givin' me sex
In the Tahoe when I jumped out the jet
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I just been ballin' out every season
Know it's some niggas I left in the bleachers
I just been married to double cup
I got to pour me a four inside another liter
Tie up the bands and then run it up
I got to put the new bales inside of the freezer
Back at the trap I was ducking them people
Ducking them birds sending out them eagles
All of my diamonds gone buss out the meter
I'm dripping water nigga, Aquafina
Damn that bitch cappin' if she think I need her
Hit it one time and then I got to leave her
I'm a real street nigga
Gotta keep it a rack with my people
Turn the whole squad to bosses
I can't be kickin' shit like I'm Adidas
