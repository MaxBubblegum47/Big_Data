[Intro]
(Hold up, hold up, hold up, wait bring that beat back)
Got a blank check so Ima scribble what I want, sc-scribble what I want, sc-scribble what I want
Pocket full of money so I’m gettin’ what I want, ge-gettin’ what I want, ge-gettin’ what I want

[Pre-Hook]
I walk around laughing but there ain’t shit funny
Damn it feel good to be that nigga gettin’ money
While y’all ain’t gettin’ nothing, I’m still gettin’ money
Since the nigga gettin’ bread, they bound to feel crumby

[Hook]
Watch me
(Rolling in the dough, rolling, rolling in the dough)
I see you gettin’ money, I be -
(Rolling in the dough, rolling, rolling in the dough)
I see he gettin’ money, she be -
(Rolling in the dough, rolling, rolling in the dough)
I see she gettin’ money, we be -
(Rolling in the dough, rolling, rolling in the dough)
We gettin’ money now got the haters like

[Verse]
Not to sound conceited
But when you see what my bank receipts is
You gon' want to be on top of my sheets like lines to loose leaf
I'm on my green like vegans, that's vegetarian
I see you staring at the new V, Hiccup
Pockets got a sixth sense, all they see is dead people
Mhmm I pay the haters no mind
'Cause I never knew they name
But I know they know mine
Ask any bad broad bet I know she knows Sean
GOOD Music bitch, I know you know Kan-Ye
Yup, he's the reason that I'm paid
One look at you will make me thank God that I'm made
The girls that call me ugly is the ones who wanna love me
So now I let 'em love me, when I'm done I call 'em ugly, yes
If money stinks I admit I'm pretty musky
Eatin' till I'm chubby boy

[Pre-Hook]
I walk around laughing but there ain’t shit funny
Damn it feel good to be that nigga gettin’ money
While y’all ain’t gettin’ nothing, I’m still gettin’ money
Since the nigga gettin’ bread, they bound to feel crumby

[Hook]
Watch me
(Rolling in the dough, rolling, rolling in the dough)
I see you gettin’ money, I be -
(Rolling in the dough, rolling, rolling in the dough)
I see he gettin’ money, she be -
(Rolling in the dough, rolling, rolling in the dough)
I see she gettin’ money, we be -
(Rolling in the dough, rolling, rolling in the dough)
We gettin’ money now got the haters like

[Outro]
We rollin' in the dough, ro-rollin' in the dough
Nah, nah, that ain't all of it man
I can't give you all that neither
Like I said,
