Ho-ho-ho-ho-holy shit

All this money on me
Now come take it from a G
All she tryna do is get naked (Naked, naked)

[Chorus]
And she gon' shake it like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
And she gon' shake it like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose
And she gon' shake it like a red nose (Woah)

And she gon' shake it like a red nose (They already know me, S-A-G-E)
Like a, like a, like a red nose (Black Money in this bitch, boy, okay)

[Verse 1]
That booty talkin' to me, what that shit say? (Shit say)
Shake it for the dojo, I'm the sensei (Sensei)
When she wobble with my song on replay (Replay)
Almost got her a house up off Kings Way (Woah)
I told her shake it like a red-nose pitbull (Pitbull)
And I'ma keep throwin' money 'til your bank full (Bank full)
Cake, cake, cake, cake, birthday suit
Damn, in a little, I'ma forget your age soon (Age soon)
Woah, okay, now let's do it my way (Woah)
If she don't go crazy, then she walkin' on the highway (Woah)
And if she don't believe me, tell that bitch just try me (Woah)
Bet you she be shakin' from the club back to my place, woah

[Pre-Chorus]

Now come take it from a G
All she tryna do is get naked (Naked, naked)

And she gon' shake it like a red nose (Right?)
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose (Right)
And she gon' shake it like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose

[Verse 2]
I told her time to go to work, clock in (Clock in)
Go'n open up, I'm a locksmith (Locksmith)
West Side, tell them other people stop it
I'm fly, and that's why she headed to the cockpit (Woah)
Black Money Sage, whoadie I'm a winner (Winner)
I just play 'em like a game, I don't press enter (Enter)
I'm hella raw, listen to the way I did her (Did her)
I was in her and her nigga was there makin' dinner
Uh, all this money start movin' and I'ma throw it
She choosin', I got her lookin', you losin', okay
Black Money, we take 'em, hit it and quit it
We shake 'em and if she like me it's nathan, okay
Party hard, party hard with no party fouls
Couple girls in the back with some party mouths
Cave her back in, then turn the party out (Party out)
Shake it like a red nose, time to let 'em out, woah

All this money on me
Now come take it from a G
All she tryna do is get naked (Naked, naked)
