[Verse 1]
Everybody shouting, working up a sweat
Stepping over lines, you know what happen next
More trouble than anyone can use
It's a predetermined thing, you lose your right to choose
No way to turn it around
You got no more time, no time to calm yourself down
Once you press the button man it's coming to a head
Pretty soon, babe, you'll be a long time dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Little brother, I'm telling you now
Your pride can take a hit
Little brother, take a deep breath
Cool off, man, forget about it!
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Drop the weapon
Kick it away
Drop your gun
Look the other way
Drop the weapon
Live another day
Drop your blade
Listen to what I say

[Verse 2]
Who you're trying to impress? You making a bid
To be a big shot brother, but you're just a small kid
Now your reputation got a minor stain
It'll be washed away by tomorrow's rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Little brother, I'm telling you now
Your pride can take a hit
Little brother, take a deep breath
Cool off, man, forget about it!
Mmh, mmh, mmh

[Chorus]
Drop the weapon
Kick it away
Drop your gun
Look the other way
Drop the weapon
Live another day
Drop your blade
Listen to what I say

[Post-Chorus]
No sound of silence
Just streets of violence
We're in overload
Wrong side of the road
Oh, San Francisco
Where the Hell did you go?
We have enough of that peace and love

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Drop the weapon
Kick it away
Drop your gun
Look the other way
Drop the weapon
Live another day
Drop your blade
Listen to what I say

[Post-Chorus]
No sound of silence
Just streets of violence
We're in overload
Wrong side of the road
Oh, San Francisco
Where the Hell did you go?
We have enough of that peace and love

[Outro]
Come and hold my hand
Then we can all stand
And say a prayer to someone out there
Anyone out there
