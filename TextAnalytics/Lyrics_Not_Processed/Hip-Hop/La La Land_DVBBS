[Verse 1]
I'm so over the game
And living for the weekend
Let me outta this cage
So we can start breathing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh fuck it let them talk about us
Let them talk about us
Oh they wanna play rough
Ooh fuck it we never gon' stop
Move to California and never grow up

[Chorus]
You and me in La La La La La Land
We'll be safe in La La La La La Land
These Hollywood dreams started in the bedroom
You were telling me I could be anything
If only we could
Run away to La La La La La Land

[Post-Chorus]
You and me in
You and me in
(La La Land)
You and me in La La La La Land
(La La Land)
(You and me)

[Verse 2]
The life I'm living right now
Is never what I dreamed of
So baby can we just drive
Til' we hit the ocean
Just put the keys in

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh, fuck it let them talk about us
Let them talk about us
Oh they wanna play rough
Ooh, fuck it they don't know where we'd stop
Move to California and never look back

[Chorus]
You and me in La La La La La Land (La La Land)
We'll be safe in La La La La La Land
These Hollywood dreams started in the bedroom
You were telling me I could be anything
If only we could
Run away to La La La La La Land
If only we could
Find a way to La La La La La Land

[Post-Chorus]
You and me in
You and me in
(La La Land)
You and me in La La La La Land
(La La Land)
(You and me)

[Outro]
If only we could
Run away to La La La La La Land
If only we could
Find a way to La La La La La Land
If only we could
Fall asleep in La La La La La Land
