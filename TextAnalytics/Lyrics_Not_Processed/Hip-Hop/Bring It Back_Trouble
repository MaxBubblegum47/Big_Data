Money man

[Pre-Chorus: Trouble]
Ounces in my mothafuckin' pantry (Aha)
Diamonds on a young nigga, dancin', yeah
Just dropped some bandos on some glasses, yeah
Just dropped your bitch off, man, that hoe so nasty
Huh, all about that paper, can't miss a beat, yeah
I'ma get some cho-cho, one thing 'bout me, yeah
Gossip all that hoe shit, miss me with that (Yeah)
I could put you frontline, just bring it back

[Chorus: Trouble]
Bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, yeah
Don't wanna have to chase you down 'bout them stack
'Cause I will blow ya back, bring it back, this ho here throw it back

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Yeah, tryna show me that she 'bout it
'Bout it, 'bout it, yeah, shawty 'bout it, 'bout it, yeah
Take the charges prolly, shawty say she 'bout it
I gotta come for you, you shot at my lil' partner dem
The loud wild off the gate, don't need your molly
As a git, I used to get the candy from Mr. Charlie (Mr. Charlie)
Nowadays I ride a foreign by Mr. Charlie (Mr. Charlie)
I got the candy now, sorry Mr. Charlie (Mr. Charlie)
Aye, she say you so mothafuckin' hood
But you ain't no mothafuckin' good
Might be right, gift and a curse, I take it all as blessin'
Know you fuckin' with a real one though, no question (No doubt)
Partna you gon' get spent doin' all that flexin'
So many of us shootin' you straight, ain't no pressure (Oh yeah)
Hatin' on that man won't do you no blessin' (I swear)
Tryna teach a young nigga flexin'
Wanna go to war, but you ain't got no money (No money)
Worry 'bout these hoes and you ain't got no money (No money)

'Cause I will blow ya back, bring it back, it's on here, throw it back, damn

[Verse 2: Drake & Trouble]
Yeah, I don't play no games boy, I'm at your head (At your head)
All about the family, niggas took the pledge (Took that shit)
Now you gotta own up to that shit you said
You can't push us to the edge, Trouble from the edge
Hit the gas and we outta there
Do it for the six, because we started there (Started)
I got a girl that used to ride around with 'Pac an' them ('Pac)
I gotta get it, you came from my lil' partner then (Fuck)
Yeah, Richard Mille, heavy on the watch (Bitch)
Extra million just to see the Maybach drop (Drop, drop)
Crest white smile on my face
Once I get to snappin' ain't nobody safe (Nobody)
Reality gon' hit ya or we gon' hit ya
Either way if they was with ya, they goin' with ya
Mike WiLL Made-It (Mike WiLL)
Me and Big Trouble baby (DTE)

[Pre-Chorus: Trouble]
Ounces in my mothafuckin' pantry (Yeah)
