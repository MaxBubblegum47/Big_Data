[Intro]
Can't rush the vibe, brando
Oh, lil’ bro made this?

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
If it's 'bout my money, I'm taxin' ho's
If it's 'bout my mans, I'm whackin' ho's
Crazy-ass bitch, I'm attractive ho
Let the gang-run through, pass the ho
Smash the ho, pass the ho
Bat the ho, then trash the ho
Trash the ho, smash the ho
Pass the ho, then bat the ho
Bhabie might pull up, smack the ho
Talkin’ real tough, get you out the door
That hoe put on a big show
Bhabie come through with all the dough
Bhabie come through with all the racks
Pull up, get your shit snatched
Like "Lil' bitch, let me get that
Now you won't get that shit back"

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
Ho's talk tough through their phone screen
When you see me, pussy bitch, hope you could hold spеak
They say, "Bhabie, she all talk, won't pull up to thе scene"
We push up hunnid deep in blackshots bitch, you’ll notice me
Yeah, you’ll know it’s me, his biggest fantasy
One chance is all it takes I had that ass to sleep
He say I'm all he need, that's let him join the team
And when his phone ringin' back-to-back, you’ll know it’s me

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
If it's 'bout my money, I'm taxin' ho's
If it's 'bout my mans, I'm whackin' ho's
Crazy-ass bitch, I'm attractive ho
Let the gang-run through, pass the ho
Smash the ho, pass the ho
Bat the ho, then trash the ho
Trash the ho, smash the ho
Pass the ho, then bat the ho
Bhabie might pull up, smack the ho
Talkin’ real tough, get you out the door
That hoe put on a big show
Bhabie come through with all the dough
Bhabie come through with all the racks
Pull up, get your shit snatched
Like "Lil' bitch, let me get that
Now you won't get that shit back"

[Verse 2: Lil Gotit]
He shoynk, I shlang that, niggas ain't get shit back
Ruger's and Glock 9's and babies pushin' shit back
Runnin' up a check, I'm reminiscing, hittin' four flags
In that one way course it, nah fuck it, rush it
Play with me an' get geezy, small talk be the cheapest
Oh Bhad Bhabie take it easy, don't do a whole nigga greedy
They hold for some, they need it, her cursin' on let you in here
My phone, yeah, startin' ringin', I fuck with you, you just don't see it
Shittin' by my lonely, all these ho's be on me
I know they tryna roll with me, 'cause I be stoning
Someone just phone it, a'ight, let me zone it
Credit-ass crip up on it, yeah, ass she show me
Ass she show and she say SLATT
Speakin' new truth, no, won't do that
I tray that boy he ain't dub my name
Niggas say wait, "We got plenty guns"
We all tote shots that shoot for fun
Killin' that pussy want drip for somethin'
Ain't shit, then cry made back old money
Yeah, nig' gon' rob for somethin'

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
If it's 'bout my money, I'm taxin' ho's
If it's 'bout my mans, I'm whackin' ho's
Crazy-ass bitch, I'm attractive ho
Let the gang-run through, pass the ho
Smash the ho, pass the ho
Bat the ho, then trash the ho
Trash the ho, smash the ho
Pass the ho, then bat the ho
Bhabie might pull up, smack the ho
Talkin’ real tough, get you out the door
That hoe put on a big show
Bhabie come through with all the dough
Bhabie come through with all the racks
Pull up, get your shit snatched
Like "Lil' bitch, let me get that
Now you won't get that shit back"
