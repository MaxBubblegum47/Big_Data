[Verse 1: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
I know you got a girlfriend (baby)
You know that I got a man (ooh yeah, shit)
We could wait until we're single (Damn)
But it won't be as fun then (Ooh, no, shit, baby)

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai, Chris Brown]
It's something 'bout being wrong that just feels so right
Think about it in the morning 'cause we be all night
And baby, we could keep going 'cause you already knowin'
That you never stop the show until you see the lights (Woo!)
And the lights ain't on right now
I can't even see what's goin' on right now
'Cause this Hennessy is so strong right now
I don't even care if I'm wrong right now, right now, right now

[Chorus: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
It ain't cheating
It's a whatchamacallit (Ooh, ow!)
This could be our little secret
A whatchamacallit (Ow! Ooh)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Girl, I know you got a man (Oh, woah)
He can't make you lose it like I can
I can tell that you've been working (All night, all night)
'Cause baby, what he don't know won't hurt him (White lies, white lies, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai, Chris Brown]
It's something 'bout being wrong that just feels so right
Think about it in the morning 'cause we be all night
And baby, we could keep going 'cause you already knowin'
That you never stop the show until you see the lights(Woo!)
And the lights ain't on right now
I can't even see what's goin' on right now
'Cause this Hennessy is so strong right now
I don't even care if I'm wrong right now, right now, right now

[Chorus: Ella Mai, Chris Brown & Both]
It ain't cheating
Girl, it's a whatchamacallit (Ooh, ow!)
This could be our little secret
Baby, it's a whatchamacallit (Ow! Ooh)

[Bridge: Ella Mai, Chris Brown & Both]
Hey
Girl, I need it
Boy, I need it
To get you all alone in my bed, my bed
Baby, don't tempt me
To see if I can love you better
Can you love me, can't be friends, yeah
I'm thinking we can do this forever, oh yeah
And let some bullshit creep in
You might make me say, "Fuck him"

[Outro: Ella Mai, Chris Brown & Both]
It ain't cheating, no, girl, it's a whatchamacallit
It's a whatchamacallit (Ooh, ow!)
This could be our little secret, secret, ooh, it's a whatchamacallit
(It's a what, it's a what, it's a, it's a what)
This could be our little secret
(It's a what, it's a, it's a what)
Girl, it's a whatchamacallit
(It's a what, it's a, it's a what)
This could be our little secret
A whatchamacallit
