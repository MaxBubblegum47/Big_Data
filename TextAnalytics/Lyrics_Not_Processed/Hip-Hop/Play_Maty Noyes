[Verse 1: SoMo]
Pearls on her neck and a black dress on
She don't know I'ma take her home
She don't know I'ma make her feel
Like she never, ever felt before
I'm from the rough side, she's from the best
Eyes like that can be dangerous
But I like that, I got interest
I'm thinking that she could be my mistress

[Chorus: SoMo]
(Ooh na, na-na-na)
I'm foreign to the way she likes to play the game
Oh, she loves to play the game (Ooh na, na-na, na-na)
She wanna be, wanna be, wa-wanna be
She wanna be mischievous
Tell me what you want and we can play all night (Oh no-no-no-no)
(Ooh na, na-na-na)
I'm foreign to the way she likes to play the game
Oh, she loves to play the game (Ooh na, na-na, na-na)
She wanna be, wanna be, wa-wanna be
She wanna be mischievous
Tell me what you want and we can play all night (Oh no-no-no-no)

I know I'm probably outta line, but
Boy, please let me unwind
Yeah, you know that I've been working these hips
What makes you think I can't handle this?
It's been a long night
We're gonna be here all night
So we can play, we can play if you ain't a lame
You know I'm insane with the game, with the game, game, game

[Chorus: SoMo & Maty Noyes]
(Ooh na, na-na-na)
I'm foreign to the way she likes to play the game
Oh, she loves to play the game (Ooh na, na-na, na-na)
She wanna be, wanna be, wa-wanna be
She wanna be mischievous
Tell me what you want and we can play all night (Oh no-no-no-no)
(Ooh na, na-na-na)
I'm foreign to the way she likes to play the game
Oh, she loves to play the game (Ooh na, na-na, na-na)
She wanna be, wanna be, wa-wanna be
She wanna be mischievous
Tell me what you want and we can play all night (Oh no-no-no-no)

[Bridge: Maty Noyes]
Ay, say you love the game
But you never play nobody else like me
And as far as I can see, it's changed once you had a taste
You won't ever want nobody else but me
Once you're in, you're into me (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus: SoMo & Maty Noyes]
(Ooh na, na-na-na)
I'm foreign to the way she likes to play the game
Oh, she loves to play the game (Ooh na, na-na, na-na)
She wanna be, wanna be, wa-wanna be
She wanna be mischievous
Tell me what you want and we can play all night (Oh no-no-no-no)
(Ooh na, na-na-na)
I'm foreign to the way she likes to play the game
Oh, she loves to play the game (Ooh na, na-na, na-na)
She wanna be, wanna be, wa-wanna be
She wanna be mischievous
Tell me what you want and we can play all night (Oh no-no-no-no)
