[Verse 1]
You say
You fell in love wit a trapper
Who ever said I was trappin ?
I jus be driving
He said he gettin sum money, but he ain't getting no money
He just be lyin'
You said he tears you up, I see he tears you up
I know you crying
He put his hands on you jus one more time
And that nigga dying
Good luck with niggas that ain't me
I gave you things you ain't thank me
I did sum shit now you hate me
But you still wanna have my baby, Girl
You still acting all crazy
No drive wanna be lazy
Love me, shit starts fading
Now for my time, you gotta pay me girl

[Hook]
You fell in love wit a trapper, I jus be trappin
I don't got time for you
Still to this day, we be moving
Get you a ticket, you could be flying too
Calling me talking bout bitches
I'm in the trenches, you think I'm lying to you
But im not lying to you
I swear you so ungratefulll
You so ungrateful, you so ungrateful
I swear you so ungratefulll
You so ungrateful, you so ungrateful
I swear you so ungratefulll woah

[Verse 2]
But I don't care too much
The reason i don't like your people n don't go around is cuz they jus compare too much
But all of the niggas you had before
How they had a bag n more?
And all of the niggas that got you stuff
N how I ain't have enough?
So fuck what your people said, man they old people
And I don't even know people
We jus be selling weed
All my sells seeds
Man I fuck round n grow people
And the re-up I ordered, it took a minute
It can take my cross the border
When I'm in this shit be water
But when you flushing out of order

[Hook]
You fell in love wit a trapper, I jus be trappin
I don't got time for you
Still to this day, we be moving
Get you a ticket, you could be flying too
Calling me talking bout bitches
I'm in the trenches, you think I'm lying to you
But im not lying to you
I swear you so ungratefulll
You so ungrateful, you so ungrateful
I swear you so ungratefulll
You so ungrateful, you so ungrateful
I swear you so ungratefulll woah
