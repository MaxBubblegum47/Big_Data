Read Chris Webby's Explanation "Sativa"

[Hook: Zacari]
Roll that heady
Fill my Chevy with the vapors
AK-47 in them double wide papers
So I break up half and save the rest of it for later
So come and get in touch with nature 'cos, baby, you know we smoking that sativa
We smoking that sativa
We smoking that...

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
This shit is sublime
Hit it and lift up your mind
The most specific of kinds
Particular strains I'm smoking during daytime
Got me feeling high and energetic at the same damn time
I'm on a path to where I don't know
With a little bit of Jack Herer in my bowl
Euphoric, yo, with the Oreos
And whatever other snacks I carried back home
Got the Tangie from my Cypress Hill Family
In high demand the types of strands
Dispensaries be selling out like they be supplying the kids candy
High as Iron-Man with 90 grams
And, yo, this weed here ain't no runner up
This weed won the cup
Enough's enough, we puffin' tough
My blunt is stuffed with Thunderfuck
Like I'm purposely trying to disobey Scruff Mcgruff
'Cos this Silver Haze will leave you lit for days
And this shit's amazing
Zoned out playing Ninja Gaiden
Joystick's engaging, Taking a rip and flaming
The Canadian fragrance blazing
And it's chased with a great sensation
Don't change the station ehh
My brain's on a paid vacation
With sativa in my vehicle, chiefin'
Turn up the speakers
The green is my teacher
Like Yoda leading Jedi procedures

[Verse 2: Demrick]
I spend my days in a daze smoking Lemon Haze
Out in Amsterdam where women love to entertain
The Greenhouse Coffee Shop the red light
When I'm in Holland that's the spot I go to get right
Roll my weed up, smoke sativa kick my feet up
Look for tracks that I can eat up when I heat up it's a fever
And my stoner chick's a diva, all I feed her is that greenery
Raw papers wrapped around that Sour D
And this life ain't want it seem to be
It's something like a dream to me
This weed'll it give me energy
Best believe my enemies, they don't last long
Joints getting ashed then passed to a sad song
I remember not knowing 'bout the different strains
Copping dimes out in the projects in the pouring rain
Now I hit up the dispensary they know the name for smoking on that fire flame
You know this shit is not a game
And that raspberry cough in my bag's very strong
Hotbox, you won't last very long
See the smoke through the glass of the bong
Take a hit, hold on, don't pass 'till it's gone
Play this track watch my fans sing along
Boy, we lit, yeah, we high, man, we on
Blazing Acapulco Gold
With my partners getting stoned
It's sativa man, straight to the dome

[Verse 3: B-Real]
I ain't smoking that bullshit
Let me tell what I don't do
I ain't smoking that bullshit
Let me tell you what I won't do
I ain't smoking that bullshit
Let me tell what I don't do (no)
I ain't smoking that bullshit
Let me tell you what I won't do
Pass this shit
'Cos it's boo boo
Backyard boogie we don't touch
But I heard you do
Fucking cursed like it's voodoo
You could see me takin' flight on that jet fuel
And we blowin' sativa on the next two
Getting so elevated that we forget you
Faded with Webby on the set, fool
No matter how many requests we don't accept you
Better be taking it to the chest, fool
No stress, it's all incredible
I be putting you out with an edible
Laid out, nigga blazed out, let me fade out, feeling played out, hey now
How many hits can you take now?
How many hits 'fore you break down?
How many minutes go by you say you feeling fake now?
How many swirls you got wrapped around the jay now?
