[Intro: Big Shaq]
Yo, Big Shaq (the one and only)
I told them check the statistacs
Man's not hot, skrrat, skidi-kat-kat, boom

[Verse 1: Big Shaq]
Two plus two is four
Minus one that's three, quick maths
Everyday man's on the block, smoke trees
See your girl in the park, that girl is a uckers
When the ting went quack-quack-quack
You man were ducking
 (remix ting)

[Verse 2: Lethal Bizzle]
Five plus five is ten, add a quick M, that's my net worth
Every day I drink shocker, get burse
See your girl in my Rolls, Snapchat, doing thot pose
Two twos, now she in the back, no clothes
Hold tight Muttley (my brudda)
, he's got the flavors
Hold tight Damon (my G), he's got the shavers
You might see me creep through the ends (creeping), no Benz (nah)
Hit Western Fried (quick), go check couple friends
My ting goes papow, pow-pow-pow-pow-pow
Chk-a-chk, papow, pow-pow-pow
Chk-a-chk, kwasia, pow-pow-pow-pow-pow
Pow-pow
, leave it

[Chorus: Big Shaq]
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)

[Verse 3: Chip]
Chippy, ayy
Hopped out the four door with the .44, stop lying, you ain't got no mash
Better fix them fiction raps
, man tell lies, facts (trust me)
Man get silly on mic (wagwan), so man get drilly on guys (brrrt)
I don't care about a million views, you'll get blasted a million times (boom)
Man buss mic and break rules (rules), I got wordplay gems and jewels (jewels)
In the club in my jacket and all this ice, like man's not hot, man's cool (flex)
League of my own, don't care about titles, don't mind rivals, I (baow)
Bring a storm like Michael
, 
bad like Michael
, 
dapper like Michael
In Hollywood doing ten toes (out 'ere), 
dressed like a London bloke (sauce)
Out here, you can't find no wife (nah), it's just thots and skets and hoes (mad ting)
And the Cali's just hitting my dome (dome), I'm too high man, I gotta go home (go yard)
Gang book flights and go, man already know how this ting goes (yeah)

[Refrain: Big Shaq]
The ting goes skrrrahh (ah)
Pap, pap, ka-ka-ka (ka)
Skidiki-pap-pap (pap)
And a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom (boom)

[Verse 4: Krept]
Me plus your girl in a bed, equals sperm in her egg, quick science
She swallowed that too, quick diets (mad ting)
You ain't fully on arms, you ain't fully on wars
Oi Shaq, heard your ting went quack
My ting went woof-woof-woof and hit one of your dargs (Asnee)
Less jokes, more bars in, them man ain't on warrin'
Man jump out, no warnin', man ah start mmmin' and arghin'
Kojo Funds, dun talkin'
, skidiki pop-pop, man's sparring
They went Dagenham, only time man's been on barking
Krept's so wrong, if I was on Love Island, woulda tried beat Jess, no 'dom
I don't wanna dead no beef, I don't want to sort it out (hold tight Dave)
The ting goes skrrrahh, mind how you talk in south (brilliant)
Hold tight Femz (free up), he was on mayhem
Like 15, on a 410 bus with a skeng doe, tryna do AMs (mad, mad, mad)

[Verse 5: Konan]
Your girl don't wanna let me go, must be the Versace
Now she getting D in a car, listening to Cardi
My young boy got it in a party, 3-6-5 no days off
If I aim it dat way, I'll bet your boys all take off (dat way)
All I see is clowns and neeks, leave a boy counting sheep
Mum told me count to 10 before I put a boy down in street
I hear them talkin' bout war, make sure you're sure
I call my young boy Jay-Z, what you think he's got the .44 for?
Girls say, "look at his watch", girls say, "look at his watch" (look at it)
All this ice on my top, man could never be hot (never)
I told him gimme all three like I get it all free (gimme that)
My weed man from Ghana (chale), all he do is talk tree

[Chorus: Big Shaq]
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)

[Verse 6: Jme]
Serious, yeah, you know the line
, man thought I can only flow to grime
Speed equals distance over time
When man said "quick maths", that came to mind
Man like me get flashed and pay the fine, pay that, card or cash, it ain't declined
If they told you that I weren't hot, trust me, fam, that's a lie
Fuck that, man's hot, 
0-60 in the whip man's got
Burning rubber like mum's Dutch pot, smells like
 
Michelin or Dunlop
Dem man are listening, but I'm not, don't want to hear about some cunch spot
With Skutnu or Oosna, man run shop, used to roll with man with a one pop
Now I spit bars and sound like gunshots, I tell a man "get back"
Or I'll slap that black flat cap, donâ€™t give me backchat
Chatting poop, look, come out the room, slap
Left hook, you're shook, now boom, poom-poom
You dun' know

[Chorus: Big Shaq]
I tell her man's not hot, I tell her man's not hot
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)

[Refrain: Big Shaq]
The ting goes skrrrahh (ah)
Pap, pap, ka-ka-ka (ka)
Skidiki-pap-pap (pap)
And a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom (boom)
Skya (ah), du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun (dun)
Poom, poom, you don' know

[Outro: Big Shaq]
Big Shaq, man's not hot
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
40 degrees and man's not hot (come on)
Yo, in the sauna, man's not hot (never hot)
Yeah, skidika-pap-pap
