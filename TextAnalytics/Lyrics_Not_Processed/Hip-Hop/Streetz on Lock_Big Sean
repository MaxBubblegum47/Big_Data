[Intro]
What’s next man?
Big Shan I see you, we made it
It’s Big Sean, Detroit, Detroit
It’s good music baby, still finalizing it
It’s all good, it’s been Finally Famous

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
You know me, a few hundred for the tee on
Same for the jean on, shit you don’t be on
Man I ain’t Celine, but I’m finna put the D on
Went from doing talent shows to a colosseum
I’m on deck like a shipwreck, damn
Man I get big checks like my nights with six X
That’s high sixty
And I’m busy like bone thugs with more buzz
Than four cups, that’s mo’d up and showing up
They talking ish again, you too?
Man I was on the road with bands like U2
Other side of the globe with the flow doing shows
Man I could give a damn about niggas on YouTube
(And that’s real)
And I’m from the hood around the boulevard
Funny now ‘cause I’m on Hollywood boulevard
So when I drive by, there’s camera’s shooting at a nigga
Call it Hollywood’s drive by

[Hook: Big Sean + (Big Shan)]
I got the D on lock man
Streets gon’ watch man, man, man
(It’s funny how the take [?])
I got a few stacks in the knock
Can’t fit ‘em in the sock like, like, like
(It’s crazy how I’m paid for this)
And the girl’s come with dollars now
(Big Sean what up though)
So they all follow now, now, now
(Watch them hoes chase the G)
I’m the man with the facts
You can check the stacks
(We made it, finally famous)
Look, look, look
(Hater’s blocking but I make my hits)

[Verse 2: Big Shan]
You know me, you know how I do
Mink on the coat, alligator on them shoes
Buffalo tux, Cartier with the jewels
But enough about me, homie what about you?
You ain’t gotta adore me
But you’ll surely, T-C-E-P-S-E-R me
Spell it backwards since you try to reflect me
Try to be me in the mirror
You’re reminded, respect me
And if you got a handkerchief
Go and get it out dude
Money talks, and I’m talking with my mouth full
Uh, so excuse me for spitting
I got the Gucci grip so you won’t catch me slipping
I got a dumb swag but I’m rather intelligent, hmm
I went to college just for the hell of it
I came in, took a look, then I took it over
I barely went to class
And when I did, it was over
I was coming just for the hoes anyway

[Hook: Big Sean + (Big Shan)]
I got the D on lock man
Streets gon’ watch man, man, man
(It’s funny how the take [?])
I got a few stacks in the knock
Can’t fit ‘em in the sock like, like, like
(It’s crazy how I’m paid for this)
And the girl’s come with dollars now
So they all follow now, now, now
(Watch them hoes chase the D)
I’m the man with the facts
You can check the stacks
Look, look, look
(Hater’s blocking but I make my hits)
