[Verse: Bhad Bhabie]
Moon walking ‘till that cash make that bag pull
Bitches still hating, I ain’t trippin’, I’m still mad rich
When I think about success, fucking sucks
Got these racks all in my face, tryna [?]
Going up
Every day I lose another fuck
Every week a new family member, poppin' up when, I’m under pressure

[?]
Said “I’m blowing up”, no bitch [?]
I’m silver cut, [?]
Feeling me now, when I was down, you wasn’t giving a fuck?

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Plug walk (plug walk, plug, plug)
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk
(Huh? what, what?)
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk
(Skrrt, pull up in a space coupe)
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off (ooh, ooh, lil' bitch)
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk
