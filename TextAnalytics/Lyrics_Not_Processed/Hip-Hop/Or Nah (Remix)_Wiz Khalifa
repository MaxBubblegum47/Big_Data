Tahahaha

I don't mind spending it
Tahaha, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'ma smoke this joint then I'ma break you off
I'd be lying if I said you ain't the one
All these tattoos in my skin, they turn you on
Lotta smokin', drinkin' â€“ that's the shit I'm on
Heard you not the type that you take home to Mom
Is we fucking when we leave the club or nah?
I ain't spending cash for nothin', I wanna see you take it off
I'ma pop this bottle, you gon' give me brain or nah? (Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Do you like the way I flick my tongue or nah? (Or nah)
You can ride my face until you're drippin' cum (Drippin' cum)
Can you lick the tip then throat the dick or nah? (Can you do it please?)
Can you let me stretch that pussy out or nah? (Or nah, or nah)
I'm not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrapping 'round me is a problem
Ain't nobody tryna save ya, baby, get that paper
Probably got a lot of other bitches owe you favors
Pussy so good, had to save that shit for later
Took her to the kitchen, fucked her right there on the table
She repping XO to the death (Ooh, yeah)

I'm tryna fuck her and her friends (Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
