[Intro: 03 Greedo]
Yeah, trap house
I'ma hang out in the trap house
Mustard on the beat, ho
I’ma take you there

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
No sheets on top my bed (Trap house)
When I be here in the morning (Trap house)
No sheets on top my bed (Trap house)
In the morning (In my trap house)
No sheets on top my bed (No sheets)
When I be here in the morning
She's only here when I want it

[Verse 1: Rob Vicious]
Hit her at the trap house, I'ma blow her back out
Hell nah, we can’t kick it, baby, don't you try to pass out
I can't even trust you, gotta fuck you with my MAC out
100s in the safe, baby, I can't leave the cash out
Mask on, mask off, Rob be getting crack off
Fuck me and my niggas, baby, we gon' have to crack off
Sleeping in the trap house, fucking in the blackout
Still up in the Pyrex, I'm just tryna get her track out
Rock out with them racks out and I fuck once, can't run back
In and out the trap house, I spend dollars, make funds back
Tryna bank woods, cracked out and my nigga feel me, you done that
Bitch, my name Rob Vicious, ain't ’bout money then fuck that (Fuck that)

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
No sheets on top my bed (Trap house)
When I be here in the morning (In my trap house)
No sheets on top my bed (In my trap house)
In the morning (In my trap house)
No sheets on top my bed (No sheets)
When I be here in the morning
She’s only here when I want it

[Verse 2: Ohgeesy]
Her nigga just can't, so your ass gotta go
I got a boss bitch, I can’t keep a little ho
I do it how I want, I don't gotta sell my soul
And I sell blue pills you can smoke off the foil
I got Oxy, Xanny, take off your panties
Fresh like Mannie, got it straight from my granny
I'ma sip it, soda how I mix it
She steady sucking dick, so her lips, I wouldn't kiss it
Hit, I go missing, you hit her in mission
I hit from the back, that’s the only position
Free my nigga Greedo out the motherfucking prison
We still rapping dope, cooking coke in the kitchen, ayy

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
No sheets on top my bed (Trap house)
When I be here in the morning (Trap house)
No sheets on top my bed (In my trap house)
In the morning (In my trap house)
No sheets on top my bed (No sheets)
When I be here in the morning
She's only here when I want it

[Bridge: 03 Greedo]
Yeah, dripping that sauce, yeah, you heard what I said
Yeah, Grape Street, Watts, I'ma throw her a brick
Yeah, dripping that sauce, yeah, you heard what I said
Yeah, Grape Street, Watts, I'ma throw her a brick

[Chorus: 03 Greedo]
No sheets on top my bed, yeah (On top, my trap house)
No sheets on top my bed, yeah, yeah (No sheets, no fun)
No sheets on top my bed (Just a mattress, just a mattress)
When I be here in the morning (Yeah)

[Outro: 03 Greedo]
No sheets on top my bed (That bitch in my bed)
When I be here in the morning, yeah (Bitch in my trap house)
Top my bed, yeah (Hit that bitch in my bed, hit that bitch in my trap house)
No sheets on top my bed, ooh, hit her in my trap house
