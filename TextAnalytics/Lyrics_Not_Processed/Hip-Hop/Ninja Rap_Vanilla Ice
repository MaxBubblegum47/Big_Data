[Verse 1]
YO! It's the green machine
Gonna rock the town without being seen
Have you ever seen a turtle Get Down?
Slammin and Jammin to the new swing sound
Yeah, everybody let's move
Vanilla is here with the New Jack Groove
Gonna rock, And roll this place
With the power of the ninja turtle bass
Iceman, Ya know I'm not playin
Devastate the show while the turtles are sayin

[Hook]
Ninja, Ninja, RAP! Ninja, Ninja, RAP! GO GO GO GO!
Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO: Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO!
Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO: Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO!
GO GO GO GO!

[Verse 2]
Lyrics, fill in the gap
Drop that bass and get the NINJA RAP
Feel it, if you know what I mean
Give it up, For those heroes in green
Just flowin, Smooth with the power
Givin it up, Hour after hour
Cause in this life there's only one winner
You better aim straight so you can hit the center
In it to win it, With a team of four
Ninja Turtles that you gotta adore it's the
Chorus

[Verse 3]
Villians you better run and hide
Because one day you might not slide
So choose, Your weapon but don't slip
Vanilla's in control with the flex of the mic grip
Rockin the crowd the way it should be rocked
With the Miami drop that you like alot
You know it's hittin, Like a ninja turtle
When the bass kicks in, You better check your level
The power of the ninja is strong
Fightin all crooks until they're all out cold
Chorus 2x
