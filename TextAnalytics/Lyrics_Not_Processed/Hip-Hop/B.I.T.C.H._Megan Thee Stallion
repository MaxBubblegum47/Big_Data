[Intro]
I'd rather keep it real with ya
Real hot girl shit, ah
It ain't always about what you like, sometimes it's about what's right
Helluva made this beat, baby
Huh

[Chorus]
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
Why you wanna play with me? You know I'm undefeated
A real hot girl know how to keep a nigga heated
You say you want respect, well, treat me how you wanna be treated
You told me keep it real, but you don't practice what you preachin'
You want me to blow your phone up and come a-lookin' for you 'til I find ya
You really want me to whoop the ho that you fuckin' with if I find her
Bitch, you ain't that busy, I don't give a fuck what you ain't got time for
You look me in my eyes and know you lying, man, that's fraud, bruh
Man, you knew I was a player 'fore you met me, need to relax
You know that you gon' hate me if I get to playin' get-back
I ain't turn into no bad bitch when you met me, boy, I been that
You tryna make me somethin' that I ain't, and I ain't with that (Nah)

[Chorus]
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right

[Verse 2]
I got my mind on gettin' paid, we ain't spoke in some days
He probably thinkin' I'm in pain, but I'm really on game
Ain't no nigga finna stop me, independent, I got me
All the shit that I be needin', can't depend on a "probably"
And that's fucked up, 'cause you know that I don't fuck with nobody
I be quiet, but you out here tellin' stories, one-sided
I ain't perfect and I try to fix the shit that ain't workin'
But it's 2020, I ain't finna argue 'bout twerkin'
Since you wanna test them waters, might as well jump in with both feet
If you leave me and you see me, better act like you don't know me
If you think this shit get better with another bitch, go get her (Go and get her)
When you realize she ain't got you like I got you, I can't help ya

[Chorus]
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right

[Outro]
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather keep it real with ya
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
