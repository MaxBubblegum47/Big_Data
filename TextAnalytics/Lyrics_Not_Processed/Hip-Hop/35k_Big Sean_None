Okay, what's, in your bank, at the same as your mouth
Got a girl at the bank, and be pullin her account (Ching)
Bounce witcha Boy, You know I'm on a ball
Party at the loft, and we all had a ball

Go girls sing along, cause we all got a song

You niggas better boss up, Get your money up
Like a coin toss up, Aye

Profit person controversy, Oh boy we straight
We straight tell the judge to send that Briefcase
We'll make that shit a Brief Case

See these Bucks was Thirty-Five, But they retail Twenty-Three
