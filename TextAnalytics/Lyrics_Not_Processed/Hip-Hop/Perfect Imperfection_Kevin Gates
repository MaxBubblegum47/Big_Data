[Intro]
I wear my emotions on my sleeve you know what I'm saying
I've always been like that, my whole life, man
If I fuck with you, I'm all the way out there
If I don't fuck with you
I don't mind you knowing I don't fuck with you

[Verse  1]
Breaking down a key of coke, I ain't never seen a boat
Khaza got circumcised thinkin I'mma need a load
Boobie he a shooter hit the top of your medulla
From a scooter with a ruger I don't think he even need a scope
Attending college been a goal that I'm after
Evaded doin' life without parole wearin' shackles
I'm only fucking with what matters
A washed up rapper talking trash doesn't matter
Front windshield of the car went in shatters
My nigga brains blown out layin' in my lap
Told God take me, everybody blamed me
Praying till I'm prayed out won't bring him back

[Bridge]
They say my life is amazing
Funny been a question kinda wonder how I made it
Forest Gump and I got something in common
The world treat you different when brilliant

[Verse 2]
We ain't booted off a molly, we don't do shrooms
All we do is pass gas loud, excuse who?
Twin-turbo 911 make it vroom vroom
We in all black, my mechanic, make the tool move
Say you sip lean, yeah, I do too
I ain't tryna hit your cup, nigga, do you
I'm Michael Jackson, I'm reincarnated
I channel this spirit like Ali the greatest
Medicinal marijuana, am I medicated?
Aerosmith jaded
She looked like Nala when she got on top me
I gazed in her eyes and responded
Can we go half on a baby?
Broke another fingernail scratching up my back
Navel was to the ceiling when I'm pushing on her pelvis
See my tattoo of Elvis when I'm tearing up her cat
She tapped

[Hook]
I'm a perfect imperfection
My craft has been perfected
I just need affection
Emotionally, Imma introvert but it comes off as aggression
No one understand me and everybody can't be slow
It's refreshing to find someone who think like me so I can't be wrong
I'm a perfect imperfection and I don't find interest in the radio
So everytime I get high I watch the time pass by like away we go
Is it okay to cry when you're dying inside?
Seem like codeine is the one thing that help take my mind from the lies

[Verse 3]
Point the flame at my brain with the full clip
Drake said Gates do his thing he don't bullshit
All you other niggas rap about is bullshit
Studio on drugs and you get all in your feelings
Look into your eyes nigga you ain't ever lived it
But always talking cooking dope nigga ever had heart ache
Ever lost money learning how to cook oil based
Ever grind hard tryna pay for your lawyer?
Get him paid off and you still go to jail
And that bitch that you love don't pick up when you call her
Fuckin' with your nigga when you get out and you dog her
Going with your mood with a nigga you don't argue
Came here to die in the game I'm retarded
Know its got a name I ain't knowing what to call it
Mama 3 way the call chopping game, me and 40
Freeman I look to you nigga and I love you
Know you lost your parents but with me you got a brother
Malaki and Chris Sprite all same trap
Cousin Lil Quick telling me he wanna rap
Uptown Beezy the white house administration
Get the paper had to see Tyrese in a scrap
When his seatbelt strap make it hard to lean back
Sittin' up straight in the car with the shades on
Young Seven with the jensen and my main man gone
I was doing time up in rivers when he came home
Now I'm waiting on a nigga for the get out of line
No drive by we jump out and dump where you grind
Excuse me I meant to say where you spend time
You too scared to hustle you just wasting time
I used to spend nights with Khalil and Jaquincy
And his brother fucked with the ones who against me
Stop making threats cause I swear I hate livin'
You say you don't like me well shut up or kill me
Well shut up or kill me
You say you don't like me well shut up or kill me
Bitch shut up or kill me

[Hook]
I'm a perfect imperfection
My craft has been perfected
I just need affection
Emotionally, Imma introvert but it comes off as aggression
No one understand me and everybody can't be slow
It's refreshing to find someone who thinks like me so I can't be wrong
I'm a perfect imperfection and I don't find interest in the radio
So everytime I get high I watch the time pass by like away we go
Is it ok to cry when you're dying inside?
Seem like codeine is the one thing that help take my mind from the lies
