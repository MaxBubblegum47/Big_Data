[Intro: Jeremih & Aminé]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I just bought myself a brand new whip today
I just rode a couple L's like I'm Cool J
Got a text from your girl, I'm like "Who is this?"
All my niggas carry hammer 'cause I'm too legit
Pouring all the Champagne, I know you tipsy
From LA, but that ass straight from Tennessee
I just might send an Uber down to Sunset
That's how you know it's going down baby

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Girl you know you ain't you got to pay for it
Take your shirt off on the elevator
She go down low, keep a steady pace
Ain't no love unless it's made by Cartier

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I know you know what you started
It only takes two for us to party
Gonna do it for the fuck if it
I'm 'bout to take it down, down for the fuck of it
Oh, wait a minute
I know you know you know what you started
It only takes two for us to party
Gonna do it for the guck of it
I'm 'bout to take it down, down for the fuck of it
Oh, wait a minute

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Aye!
I need a girl who gon' twirl it like a hurricane (true)
Lil' freak, plus she read a little Hemingway
I like them smart girls
One of them, "I like art" girls (yee)
I make 'em leave like what Tia and Tamara say
Spin it like you vashtie, tell me what's in those jeans
Skin popping but she always rocking Acne
She been on Melrose, she's a rose (true)
She's my golden trophy, need a clone
Don't touch my drink if you ain't got wallet
Aminé pretty, pretty, baby, he's free fallin'
I got some options, Club Banana poppin'
Shawty looking cute so I put her in my wallet

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Girl you know you ain't you got to pay for it
Take your shirt off on the elevator
She go down low, keep a steady pace
Ain't no love unless it's made by Cartier

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I know you know what you started
It only takes two for us to party
Gonna do it for the fuck if it
I'm 'bout to take it down, down for the fuck of it
Oh, wait a minute
I know you know you know what you started
It only takes two for us to party
Gonna do it for the guck of it
I'm 'bout to take it down, down for the fuck of it
Oh, wait a minute

[Outro: Aminé]
Yeah, I'm 'bout to take it down for the fuck of it
I'm 'bout to make a round for the fuck of it
Let's take another round for the fuck of it
I wanna fuck you now for the fuck of it
Haha, yeah, haha
