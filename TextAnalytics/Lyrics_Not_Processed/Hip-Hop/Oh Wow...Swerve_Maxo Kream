[Part I: "Oh Wow"]

[Intro: Zoink Gang]
Oh wow
You want the next part, kablaow
Yeah, kablaow, yeah
Hold up, oh wow, shit
That's the part
Shit, I’m proud
The track
Got a whole lot of cash
Kablaow
I put a hole in your...

[Chorus: Zoink Gang]
Oh wow (Oh wow, oh wow)
She got a big old ass, I'm proud (But)
I got a whole lot of cash, kablaow
I put a hole in your ass (And then), I'm out
Like a motherfuckin’ lamp

[Verse: J. Cole]
Smoke in my nappy dreads, how you scared to die, nigga?
Don't believe that lie, I think that everybody happy dead
Hell is a fabricated figment of imagination
I done seen worse for real right there off Yadkin behind gas station
Cambridge Homes, 'partments where the girls get damaged young
From overexposure to the vultures
That prey on them like pastors is supposed to
If they wasn't so concerned about the tags that's on they clothes, but
Guess that's how it goes, fuck it, what do I know?
Ain't been in service since Jim Jones had somethin' with Hov
I document my life with rap beefs, love songs, favorite albums
In years that my niggas got blood on they sneakers from bodies they might’ve caught
I don’t judge no one, I'm just knowin’
At night, when it get quiet, that shit could fuck with 'em
And if it don't right now, it's gon’ catch up to 'em
Guilt heavy as a cloud in a thunderstorm, huh
My niggas blowing loud like an elephant
It's helpin' 'em to cope,
 I don't do nothin' if it don't
Make somethin', make a dollar
Make me wonder, make me prouder
Make me karma, make me better
I ain't no killer, don't make me have to, nigga
You want my spot, well maybe after, nigga
So active on the radio, I'm radioactive, nigga
That's a bar, I had to give it to 'em
Never slouching, not even on couches in the living room
And I feel like the world is ending soon
Is the ending good or bad? Well that's depending on you
And if you wake up in time
I know it's better to be sleep, that's why we hate the alarm
I feel you

[Chorus: Zoink Gang]
Oh wow (Oh wow, oh wow)
She got a big old ass (She got a big old butt), I'm proud (What?)
I got a whole lot of cash (Racks, racks), kablaow
I put a hole in your ass (And then), I'm out
Like a motherfuckin' lamp

[Part II: "Swerve"]

[Intro: KEY!]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Bizness Boi
Yeah, uh
Oh yeah

[Chorus: KEY!]
If I keep moving like this, then I'ma glide
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? Is this Japanese? Huh
If I keep moving like this, then I'ma glide
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? Is this Japanese? Huh

[Verse: Maxo Kream]
The way I'm robbin', niggas say I'm gonna die
I bought a baby Draco carbine, that's a motherfuckin' lie
Stephen Curry on my hip, Klay Thompson, let it fly
Southwest Murder Block Crips, we don't die, we multiply (Crip)
Maxo talk a lot of shit but is he really 'bout that life? (Say what?)
Is a pig's pussy pork and can a caterpillar fly? (That's right)
Go Go Gadget, toting ratchets, beam attachment on the side
I keep a savage that'll blast it, my crash dummies down to ride
These niggas janky than a bitch, I do my shit up on my lonely
So I can't trust you on a lick if you not Nina, Mac, or Tommy
Traphouse serving like hibachi, Draco, chopstick, baby AK
Different flavors like Tekashi, twelve gauge shotty like I'm Tr3yway
Maxo Kobe, holy moly, servin' Smokey like I'm Day-Day
Runnin' out of dog food like I fed Chico
Put a brick on your head and get you dropped like Deebo
I'm slangin' bricks like Craig, I'm tryna drop these bows

[Chorus: KEY!]
If I keep moving like this, then I'ma glide
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? Is this Japanese? Huh
If I keep moving like this, then I'ma glide
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? Is this Japanese? Huh

[Outro: JID]
Look
Alright, I fucked up my whip 'cause I'm high and I swerve
Sorry that I scared you, I ain't do that on purpose
My life been fucked up so I got problems with my nerves
My hands get sweaty, hold up, blam, steady
