[Intro: Kash Doll]
Kash Doll
Big Sean, ayy
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ready set, better yet
Got this bitch rocking like we never left
Big time, big, big time
All she want from me is just a little time
Flooded out the venue, ayy
I look better than what I've been through, yeah
It's a celebration, ayy
'Cause we made it out the basement, ayy
Stayed hungry, stayed patient, ayy
Damn, we made it out the basement, yeah

[Verse 1: Kash Doll]
Diamonds, you can spot 'em in my ear (That's right)
I'm at the jeweler, I ain't cop 'em from De Beers (Woo)
Louis luggage at the bottom of the Lear (Yeah)
Hotter than the summer hits, I got 'em for the year
Kash Doll, I'm poppin', I ain't never flowin' wack
Oh, you scared to cop it? What, you scared to blow a stack?
Me and Sean, we chillin' in the stu', we blowing back (That's right)
And failure's not an option, I ain't never goin' back (Never)
Fact, I took a detour, had to keep learnin'
He a D-boy, you a cheap version
Do arenas now like we preach sermon
I'm a D girl, so I'm determined, uh (What's up?)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ready set, better yet
Got this bitch rocking like we never left
Big time, big, big time
All she want from me is just a little time
Flooded out the venue, ayy
I look better than what I've been through, yeah
It's a celebration, ayy
'Cause we made it out the basement, ayy
Stayed hungry, stayed patient, ayy
Damn, we made it out the basement, yeah

[Verse 2: Kash Doll]
Bottles poppin', nonstoppin', yeah we celebrate (Celebrate)
Been rich, boy, pockets on hella straight (Yeah)
Got him on his knees, meditate, look
I'm hella great, look, I never wait
This is bomb music, I'm 'bout to detonate
Dear, yes, Lear jets, had to elevate
Pockets on swole, like I'm selling weight
Plus I get it in a crunch, lemon cake
More money than they thought that I would ever made (That's right)
Plus I stay gettin' paid, Section 8
I don't go Dutch, I don't ever pay
Boo'd up in Belize, Ella Mai, ayy

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ready set, better yet
Got this bitch rocking like we never left
Big time, big, big time
All she want from me is just a little time
Flooded out the venue, ayy
I look better than what I've been through, yeah
It's a celebration, ayy
'Cause we made it out the basement, ayy
Stayed hungry, stayed patient, ayy
Damn, we made it out the basement, yeah
