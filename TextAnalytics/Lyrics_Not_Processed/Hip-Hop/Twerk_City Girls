[Intro: Yung Miami & Cardi B]
(I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her)
Throw that, twerk that
(I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her)
Shake that, bounce that
(I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her)
Cardi
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her)
(Action)

[Verse 1: Yung Miami]
Do it, baby, stick it, baby
Move it, baby, lick it, baby (Do it)
Suck up on that clit until that pussy got a hickey, baby (Bounce)
Watch big, coulda bought a Range Rover (Range Rover)
Chain little, but I spent some change on it (Change on it)
Nigga mad, I'ma put the gang on him (Gang on it)
They'll die 'bout me, they'll bang on him (Facts)
And that ass poke out, lil frame on her (Ow)
Pussy so good he got my name on it (Miami)
Itty-bitty-pretty, I'm the realest in the city
Only fuckin' with the plug, got a nigga worth a billi'
Showin' love, only talk about bands when he hit me
Chose him, he ain't pick me, and we never doin' quickies

[Chorus]
(I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her)
Work that

Twerk, twerk

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, this sound like Cardi took the stage (Cardi)
This sound like Cardi with the braids (With the braids)
Jermaine Dupri, baby, money ain't a thing (Ain't a thing)
This pussy wild, they should throw it in a cage (Grr)
See my lifestyle, precise gal (Gal)
I be dripped up and wiped down, uh
I see them hoes lookin' cold, lookin' stiff, uh
Thick bitch God's gift to a dick, woo (Woo)
Drop low, look back, shit fat, shit fat
I just drop-kicked your bag, six pack, six pack
I just jumps on hit charts, impact, impact
Stop that chit-chat, get smacked, bitch better relax

[Chorus]
(I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her)
Work that
(I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her)

[Verse 3: JT]
Yeah, I see you show that, but is you gon' throw that?
If you don't let me hold that, you know where the door at (Bye)
Lil flexin' ass nigga, what is that shit? (What the fuck is that?)
Must have me confused for a rap bitch (Hol' up)
Too rude for a soft nigga, need a boss nigga
Floss nigga who don't give a fuck what it cost, nigga (Boss)
I could buy my own, but I'd rather spend y'all's, niggas
Tell them pussy-ass hoes I don't want y'all niggas
Got a penthouse up in the Mandarin (Ow)
So when you get this pussy, better handle it (Catch it)
I'm a top-notch bitch, need some top-notch dick
Smooth like a G5 when you landing it

[Chorus]
(I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her)
Work that
(I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her)
Work that
(I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her)
