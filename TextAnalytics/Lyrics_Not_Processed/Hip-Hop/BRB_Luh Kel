[Intro]
(Hello?)
Hello?
(What's up with you?)
(Every time you in my city you saying we gon' link
And I can never see you)
Man, you know I got you, fo sho

[Verse 1]
She know that she bad but she claim that she good
Straight from New York, wit' a boogie, no hood
I like the way that she flex cause she could
She get her walk and her talk from the hood
She hit my DM a couple of hearts
Said hit my line, now we can't be apart
She on my phone, all we do is talk
She on my phone, all we do is talk
She got my heart, she got my heart
I do not want be apart
She from the dirt, she from the mud
She hit my heart like a dart
I like the way, I like the way
When she pull up she don't fake
She say my name, she wet like a lake
All I can scream out is bae

[Chorus]
Baby, you my lady
BRB, please don't think I'm shady
You amaze me
I know that you don't think I'm crazy
But lately, you be acting like you hate me
You throw it back like the eighties
(Yeah-yeah )

[Verse 2]
Got a bad B from the 314
She blow my dick like a snotty nose
It feeling good but my eyes closed
Also have love for them island hoes
That's the next place that I'm tryna go
But right now I'm just gon' focus on you
I'm tryna chill and just do what we do
Watch some Netflix and we order some food
I got a lot on my plate
Just got a text from the 678
I know that it's late but she wanna heal all my pain
Say that she wet like the rain,  I know I'm to blame
'Cause I can't think of her name
But she thinking she my main
So she bought me a plane
I told her I'm on the way
When I pull up, I'ma say

[Chorus]
Baby, you my lady
BRB, please don't think I'm shady
You amaze me
I know that you don't think I'm crazy
But lately, you be acting like you hate me
You throw it back like the eighties, yeah yeah
Baby, you my lady
BRB, please don't think I'm shady
You amaze me
I know that you don't think I'm crazy
But lately, you be acting like you hate me
You throw it back like the eighties, yeah yeah
