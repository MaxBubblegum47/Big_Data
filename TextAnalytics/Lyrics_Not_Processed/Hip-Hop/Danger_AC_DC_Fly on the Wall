[Intro]
Don't talk to strangers
Keep away from the danger, yeah, yeah
Don't talk to strangers who smile
Keep away from the danger all the time
You just a-keep away

[Bridge]
Ow!
Ow!
Just a-keep away, yeah
Ow!

[Verse 1]
Red lights are flashin'
There's been a misunderstanding, yeah, yeah
I'm bruised, broke and bandaged
Through drinkin' all that brandy, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was under the table, but I came back for more
Go to hit that bottle, but my head hit the floor

[Chorus]
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away

[Verse 2]
Red lights still flashing
People all still dancin' in my head
I'm done with thinkin' about what to do
Another bout of drinkin', just one before I'm through

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just raising hell, I wasn't doing no harm
The cops could not appreciate my natural charm

[Chorus]
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away

[Chorus]
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger danger, don't you talk, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk, keep away

[Outro]
Don't you go talkin' to no stranger in this town
