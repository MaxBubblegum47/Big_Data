See I need more bottles, and more models
30 more bottles, 100 more models
For my partner them, cuzzo
And my people, what up though

[Hook]
I roll with all my people
Blow with all my people
I'm recognized everywhere
I go with all my people
Champagne sippin'
V.I.P chillin'
100 pretty girlies
That's gon' bust it for
Me and my people
I be with my people
I be, I be, I be
I be, I be, with my people

[Verse 1]
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' with my crew
And them
Cruisin' in
Oh is that your man?
SIKE!
Choose again
Hold up, hold up
Stop
Damn (damn) look
At my outfit
Everybody waving at me
And who all I'm out with
Damn he bon voyagin'
Ladies show me love
La-ladies show me love
And all my niggas
Give me pounds and
D.J. play my song when
I start standing on
The couches
And I bet, I bet, I bet
My shit is the loudest
Sippin' like a like that bitch
Come straight up out a fountain
I'm crazier than a motherfucker
I might need some counselin'
So pour it up, till we throw it up
Roll it up, blow it up
Girl you fine as hell (hell)
I just hope you legal
You should come to my
Apartment
(?) as cathedrals
We could make a movie
And your girls could make the sequel
But before we do..
Could you do it for..
Me and my people!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go
I go with all my people
And I'mma get this money
Just to blow with all my people
You know me ah
Gone like that tree high
And I'm up in the crowd
Like motherfuck
The V.I.....P!
Call me B.I
Told ol' girl in knee highs
To go put down that glass
And grab a bottle that is knee high
And I'm just so important shit
That they might be important shit
How it feel to waste liquor
That niggas cannot afford to sip
She be on that X times 3
Like it's a porno flick
My chain look like a ornament
Touch it
And you'll get that red dye
Like we recordin' shit
Terminator 4 and shit
Drinks pourin'
Now that all the cash pourin' in
Boi!
And I don't live off in no forest
But it's girls off in my bed
Like they aid
Upon my foraging(?)
Hold, stop, drop,EGO
Before you do
Could you do it fo'
Me and my people!

[Hook]
