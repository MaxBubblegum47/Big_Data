[Verse 1]
I've been drinking more wine instead of tequila
Staying in at home instead of swiping my Visa
Ain't running up a tab on a Tuesday night
And calling up a cab in the morning light
Been finding some things I didn't know about me
Every wall fell down around me
I didn't go looking, no, it just found me
What happened to me 'cause this is the new me

[Chorus]
Somebody's got me all f***** up
Like I'm three drinks in and the room is spinning
Somebody's got me calling up my mama
A little nervous, saying that I'm falling
Somebody's got me in the palm of their hand
Like the story was written, all part of God's plan
Got my back, got my soul, got my heart on my sleeve
'Cause somebody's got me, somebody's got me, somebody's got me
Somebody's got me, somebody's got me, somebody's got me

[Verse 2]
Is this how it feels to be a man?
When I wake up with her, wanna do it again
Making sure she feels safe in my arms
Fighting for the flame when you're feeling that spark
Sharing the covers to sharing the closet
Catching my breath right after I lost it
From her walking in to the dress that she's dropping
Whatever she wants, oh, she's got it, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Somebody's got me all f***** up
Like I'm three drinks in and the room is spinning
Somebody's got me calling up my mama
A little nervous, saying that I'm falling
Somebody's got me in the palm of their hand
Like the story was written, all part of God's plan
Got my back, got my soul, got my heart on my sleeve
Oh, somebody's got me, yeah
Oh, somebody's got me, mmm

[Chorus]
Somebody's got me all f***** up
Like I'm three drinks in and the room is spinning
Somebody's got me calling up my mama
A little nervous, saying that I'm falling
Somebody's got me in the palm of their hand
Like the story was written, all part of God's plan
Got my back, got my soul, got my heart on my sleeve
Oh, somebody's got me
(Somebody's got, somebody's got, somebody's got me)
Oh yeah, somebody's got me, yeah yeah
(Somebody's got, somebody's got, somebody's got me)

[Outro]
Oh, somebody's got me
Oh, somebody's got me, mmm
