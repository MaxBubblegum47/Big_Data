[Intro]
We on our OTF shit, you heard?
A nigga talking 'bout, "Mo'fucker can't use no tune"
Like mo'fucker ain't in these streets
On Lil Moe grave these niggas is straight hoes (On God)
Niggas know what's up with us man
Talkin' 'bout we don't be out here
Nigga you got us fucked up boy
Man, I get shit done boy
You tweakin', yo ass trippin'

[Verse]
Niggas call me Bloodas just like Tee out here (Let's get it)
Opps be calling Foenem phone, say I don't be out here (L's)
Catch him, knock his noodles back
Just don't tweak out here (B-r-r-r-ah)
Foenem slidin, late night huntin
Ain't no sleep out here (Skrt, skrt, skrt)
2 days back to back, that's 50 racks to be out here (On God)
Can't have no fefe on yo block
As long as Steve out here (B-r-r-r-ah)
Can't try to slide inside a fish bowl, you got beef out here (Psh)
Law keep wantin' to get Zoo out the way

Niggas hoes, they tuck they tails
'Cause they be scared (They be scared)
In that Hellcat, on the e-way, off them meds (Off the meds)

Niggas low key want that smoke
You do, you better not say it (Better not say it)
Get yo ass back in that house, we got FN not 9's (Not 9's)
My credit so A1 with killas, I be payin' my fines (My fines)
Opps be on my dick in songs but I don't pay them no mind (Pussy)
All them hoes that be with the opps, gang done broke they spine
All the crackers get robbed for they shit

That shit cost 5 racks (Shit cost 5 racks)
All these hoes be goin' for real low-key
Just buy them X (Just buy 'em X)
He got shot up in his shit, I hear he tryna flex (Tryna flex)
Never care so much, ran out of 'Woods
Just pass the Dutch (Pass the Dutch)
Your homies died, you don't never slide
It ain't adding up (It ain't addin' up)
Get caught with a pipe, you out same night
You fed or what? (You fed or what?)
New opp pack in the air, this gas or what?
He'd still be alive right now, if you niggas ain't gas him up
Give my shorties steamers and guns
I tell them slide for none (Don't slide)
Everybody with this gang-gang shit
So they ain't dying for none (Ain't dyin')
If she don't fuck on the first night, off the rip
I ain't buying her none (Ain't buyin' her none)
If I ain't got time for loving my kids
Then I ain't got time for none (Ain't got time for none)
Then I slide home to my bitch
That means no time for cuddle (No time for cuddle)
Why these niggas think they safe
'Cause they locked in? ('Cause they locked in)
Man, we thought this shit was over

You think you safe where you at out West?

They keep them Glock 10s (What, what)
Knowing they killa on the loose
It throw my vibe off (Throw my vibe off)
You lighting candles on that main street
Watch that side block (Watch that side block)
You ever stood up over a opp and knocked his dreads off? (I did)
You know a nigga claim he a hate us
But he fanned out (Let's get it)
Back then I pull up to them clubs
Them killas was sittin' in steamers (Sittin' in steamers)
How the fuck he say he ain't tell

Fuck Lil Durk, he ain't on shit, his ass a singer (What else?)
Fuck Lil Durk, his ass so goofy, he not Lamron either (What else?)
Fuck Lil Durk, he talked to 6ix9ine
Live about his people (What else?)
Niggas always say they out here
We don't never see them (They lie)
But if we do, we pop out cars
And we gone no ID them (Doo-doo-doo)
Lowkey I know they hurt, they hurt so bad
They don't IG it (They don't IG)
Jumped off the porch back then
When X was stacks, and smoking mid
69th and Ashland, used to stay right there
Right by the field (Right by the field)
Loco he stayed next door on Bishop, he was selling mid (On gang)
