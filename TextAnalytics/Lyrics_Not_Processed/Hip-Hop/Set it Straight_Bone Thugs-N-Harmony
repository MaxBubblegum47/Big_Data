[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony back in this motherfucker
(That's right That's right) The original T-H-U-G's

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]
Back to set it straight we never left and can't break up
And we're yet to be replaced
Krayzie Bone they say uh uh oh uh uh oh

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
And check my style
Inside your vein like a drug
And I got niggas passed out on the floor
They done overdosed on the thugs
Sold over 30 million records
You niggas better check it before you get up and disrespect it
And that weed for twenty-four seven nigga
I never knew noone that can smoke a pound like me
Or get down like me
And they don't make them down like me
Thugs-N-Harmony nigga the name will never die
No matter how mad these niggas is actin'
We gon go platinum
So back that shit up before we blast this bitch up
Then you get the picture ol' fag ass nigga
Beef is what you want
Nigga come and get it, got it fresh off the grill well done
Hot and ready
We don't give a fuck what you want with niggas and bitches
You be fuckin' with this and you will fill that I'm hot and ready
And you will know what I mean
I'll be the thuggish ruggish nigga on the block
With two Glocks it don't stop
I bust one time and muthafuckas call the cops on me
Thug you don't know me
So don't think y'all finna hold me
Cause homie ya'll niggas don't know me

Bizzy Bone they say uh uh oh uh uh oh

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Lock up the shit
As quick as a nigga can lock up his bitch
With a cock in is pit
Bleedin' right after we cocked him up in his crib
Rottin' in rich with a semi-automatic shotgun
Get the poppin' away up in a flick
Lookin' at the crowed all nervous and shit
My nigga Los was hittin' banks and shit
Set aside these little gangsta bitch
Cop killa we dotta love the incog neta
With as tasty as his mama as she chookin' in a casino
Man incafino niggas is only out fo they self
And expect the kids to help and set shit on the shelf
Filthy niggas get (???) and die
Like grape juice and wealth
I've been waitin' for you to start talkin' to somebody else
And we thinkin' about god in this reputation
Pussy Niggas who hatin'
How the fuck is my relations
I'm ready to get some pressure
Self built ward my local niggas are stotin'
Stakin' and makin' in dikie suits with the matchin' bandanas
Dippin' around, dippin' around
Can't nobody catch us

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]
Back to set it straight we never left and can't break up

Wish Bone they say uh uh oh uh uh oh

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
We came up Eazy died you think we was gon give up
We still some raw
Don't you deny you know we brought this game up
From the DJ's to the VJ's
From the niggas from the essay's
You know we brung this game up
Everybody knows Thugs-N-Harmony
From the beginnin' these niggas was trippin'
And wonder why I be flippin'
Who gives a fuck why I moved out of the hood dippin'
Cause these niggas don't know how to act
Catch you slippin' and I'll react
Nigga fuck what you heard
Fuck with Bone
That's a fact
Step on anybody and be ready for this movement
I've been a thug gon stay a thug
I don't talk about it I do it
Now let me explain when we came in this game
We was young thugs oh-ah all this money nigga what
Now how you blamin' a nigga with all this cash
Young black heated with a attitude like kiss my ass
We aplogise to all our fans with hands in the stands
But fuck these niggas writin' in these magazine nigga man DAMN!
