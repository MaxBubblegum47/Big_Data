[Verse 1]
Thrift store fashion
Imperfect tattoos
Taking showers
Minus shampoo

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You are my favorite everything
Been telling girls that since I was 16
Shut up, I love you
You're my best friend

[Chorus]
Get ya under pink skies, I know exactly where we should go
Cause I love the way your green eyes mix with that Malibu indigo
Talking under pink skies, I think our hearts are starting to show
That it's better, you and I, under pink skies

[Verse 2]
Underwear, I kinda care
Wanna look good for you
British bomb, you turn me on
No matter what ya do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You are my favorite everything
Been telling you that since 2015
Shut up, I love you
You're my best friend

[Chorus]
Get you under pink skies, I know exactly where we should go
Cause I love the way your green eyes mix with that Malibu indigo
Talking under pink skies, I think our hearts are starting to show
That it's better, you and I, under pink skies

[Bridge]
We can work it out
You and I are meant to be together
This is how it's supposed to feel
I'm in love with how this feels

[Chorus]
Get ya under pink skies, I know exactly where we should go
Cause I love the way your green eyes mix with that Malibu indigo
Talking under pink skies, I think our hearts are starting to show
That it's better you and I under pink skies

[Chorus]
Get you under pink skies, I know exactly where we should go
Cause I love the way your green eyes mix with that Malibu indigo
Talking under pink skies, I think our hearts are starting to show
And it's better, you and I, under pink skies
