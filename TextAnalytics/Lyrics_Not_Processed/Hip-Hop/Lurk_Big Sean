[Verse 1]
Sammy, are you into the drug life?
Sat back and just thought about what's life
We in the crib but it's feeling like club life
I'm talking champagne, popping out the tub life
My nigga been locked since '02
This his first time riding in a foreign car
He don't want a good girl, he want a porn star
That's gonna tell him what to do like Orange star
This is a night and day job
Major league contracts bigger than a rod
Thinking it's a game but you better not play me
A whole young with an old soul
It's like I'm 80 years old and I beat a win
So I'm pushing daisies you know
Tell me, have you ever had sex on the beach?
Honestly, I prefer sex and sheets
No sand in the pussy, I like [?] in the pussy
Ass love but it turned to [?] if you push me
No plan, stuck to the plan [?]
Oh, I'm with the darks, still glowing up
On the top floor and we still going up
