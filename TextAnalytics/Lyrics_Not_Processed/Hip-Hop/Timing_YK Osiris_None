[Verse 1]
See everybody want a handout
I'm tryna get it ain't no layin' down
Did I get a million how do they wanna know?
I came from nothin' I was thuggin' had no place to go
But now I'm ballin' now, ballin' like a jaguar
I came up fast so I went and bought a fast car
I got them diamonds on my neck, I spent a bag on
You see me runnin' through them hundreds now you mad now?

[Verse 2]
I'm getting the money you know
Hot boys wrist froze
Talkin' down you a lame
I can tell you ain't game
Niggas always acting strange
I will always stay the same
I will never, never change
I might buy your girl a ring yeah, yeah
I'm the hottest in my city
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me
Now I'm hopping out that Bentley
Money on my mind, money on my mind

[Chorus]
I got my mind on the money whatchu' doin'?
I'm gettin' paper young nigga I'm pursuing
Made it on my own now
Now I'm making songs now
Do it on my own now
Didn't need no loan, nah
Now she wanna fuck me
She don't wanna duck me
She just wanna show me love
She don't wanna cuff me
Mad cause I'm on now
You can't leave me alone now
Got my mama strong now
Tryna reach the throne
Yeah, yeah, yeah
