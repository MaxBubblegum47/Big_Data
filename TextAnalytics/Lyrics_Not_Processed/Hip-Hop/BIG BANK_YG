[Verse 1: YG]
My bitch drive a all white Range
Couldn't hit it if you niggas had aim
Lames can't call and you a lame
You had it then you lost it, Hall of Shame
I can buy a Bentley, don't talk to me
For a show 150, don't talk to me
You ain't never helped your mans, don't talk to me
You just follow all the trends, don't talk to me
Ayy, I set the bar, I'm the fuckin' bar
Look in the sky, I'm a fuckin' star
I don't fall in love 'cause I be lovin' hard
Do everything like my shirt, extra large
I don't care how I crash a Ghost
Got two cribs in two states, I be doing the most
I got white-folks money that I won't blow
And if you ask why, 'cause the white folks don't

[Chorus: YG & 2 Chainz]
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, it's type of money make you stay awake
Type of money, she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank (yeahhhhh)
Big bank take lil' bank, bank

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Everything proper, no propaganda
Tropicana Goyard bandana
Big sack, a lotta hoes like Santa
Threw a birthday party in a Phantom
Big shit like a dinosaur did it
And you know Tity shinin' like acrylic
Yeah I sold dope, I had cornrows
I can you see niggas hatin' with the door closed
Now I'm lookin' for a glove with the sparkle on it
And my CBD got chocolate on it
Big bank take small-ass shit
Bank account on some tall-ass shit
Attitude on some "Fuck you too"
Bankroll on "What it do, boo?"
Meet me at the room at five
And if I ain't did it yet, I'll try

[Chorus: YG, YG & Big Sean]
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, it's type of money make you stay awake
Type of money she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank

[Verse 3: Big Sean, Big Sean & LaBritney]
She said, "Whatchu' gon do if I leave?"
I said, "Bitch, I'ma do me"
B.I.G., bitch everything zoomed in (zoom)
Big bag on me lookin' like I'm movin' in (God!)
Got my foot in the door and we still here (here)
I'm a first generation millionaire (here)
I broke the curse in my family not having shit
I'm passionate like girls that's after more than just cash and dick
Feed me to the wolves, now I lead the pack and shit
You boys all cap, I'm more Colin Kaepernick
I'm rare as affordable health care (Oh God)
Or going to wealth from welfare (Goddamn)
I turn my W's to M's, yeah, I flip those
I might buy her red bottoms with the crypto
Three coins, that'll pay ya whole semester (swerve, swerve)
But you gotta ride it better than a Tesla

[Chorus: YG & Big Sean]
Big bank take lil' bank, bank (lil' bitch)
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, it's type of money make you stay awake
Type of money she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Uh-oh! Back again
Back to back, Maybach, stack the Mâ€™s
Told em' I met Slim Shady, bagged a Em
Once he go black, he'll be back again
Tell them hoes that it's crunch time, abdomen
Yes, I cop mad Chanel and mad Given'
She did it again, imagine them
'Bout to make these bum bitches mad again
Uh-oh! Back to them
I lead the pack so my back's to them
Yup, the queen's back, what's happenin'?
Re-run, 'bout to make these bitches rap again
Uh, diamond chains on my ankle
Young Money in the cut like a shank, though
Tell T.I.P. rubber bands in my bankroll
Show my ass like a stank ho

[Chorus: YG]
Big bank take lil' bank
Big bank take lil' bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, it's type of money make you stay awake
Type of money she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
