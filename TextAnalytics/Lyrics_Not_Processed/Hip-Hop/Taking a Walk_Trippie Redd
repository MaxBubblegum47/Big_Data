[Intro]
Scott Storch

[Chorus]
Ooh, so they think I wanna die, yeah
'Cause my doors are suicide, yeah
Bet my coffin would be nice, yeah
Stud that bitch up with some ice, yeah
These people don't want me alive, no
They wanna play games with my life, oh
The coupe doors are suicide, oh
The coupe doors are suicide, oh-ah

[Verse]
Said I hope you got my note bitch
Ayy, I left it on the suicide door bitch
Yeah, and you left it on the floor bitch
Ayy, rule number one, never trust no bitch
Get this green then smoke this green, gotta stay potent
Pussy nigga talking shit but he ain't know shit
Chicken noodle ass nigga, man, you boneless
Yeah, I keep my ratchet, boy, you pole-less, wayy

Throwing bands tonight
Throwing bands tonight, shawty throwing bands tonight
Throwing bands tonight, huh (Bands tonight)

[Chorus]
Ooh, so they think I wanna die, yeah
'Cause my doors are suicide, yeah
Bet my coffin would be nice, yeah
Stud that bitch up with some ice, yeah
These people don't want me alive, no
They wanna play games with my life, oh
The coupe doors are suicide, oh
The coupe doors are suicide, oh-ah
