[Verse 1]
I'm tryna fill up your red cup
I wanna cut out all the games that I know you play
I know a soft touch ain't good enough
Baby, we should get away, tell me where you stay

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be blowing up your mind li-like every week
So come roll with me, girl, for you it's free
Have you spending all your time like currency
When you're on my team, it's you and me

[Chorus]
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
Dipped in expensive jewels, latest loubs
Go 'head and send them nudes
Bougie food in Nobu, all 'cause I fuck with you
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
Dipped in expensive jewels, latest loubs
Go 'head and send them nudes
Bougie food in Nobu, all 'cause I fuck with you

[Verse 2]
So close, nobody knows what I wanna do, let's enjoy the view
When I get you outdoors, designer clothes
'Cause that sexy attitude gets me in the mood

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be blowing up your mind li-like every week
So come roll with me, girl, for you it's free
Have you spending all your time like currency
When you're on my team, it's you and me

[Chorus]
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
Dipped in expensive jewels, latest loubs
Go 'head and send them nudes
Bougie food in Nobu, all 'cause I fuck with you
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
Dipped in expensive jewels, latest loubs
Go 'head and send them nudes
Bougie food in Nobu, all 'cause I fuck with you

[Bridge]
You never had a man who satisfies
It's so natural, don't have to read your mind
I know what you like

[Chorus]
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
Dipped in expensive jewels, latest loubs
Go 'head and send them nudes
Bougie food in Nobu, all 'cause I fuck with you
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
I know what you, know what you, know what you, know you like
Dipped in expensive jewels, latest loubs
Go 'head and send them nudes
Bougie food in Nobu, all 'cause I fuck with you

[Outro]
Girl, I know what, I know, I know what you like
Girl, I know what, I know, I know what you like
I know what you, I know, I know what you like
I know what you, I know, I know what you like
I know what you, I know, I know what you like
I know what you, I know, I know what you like
