[Verse 1]
I got this thing, gonna blow your mind
Pulling the string, helping you unwind
You want to know, but it can't be taught
You want to steal, cause it can't be bought

[Chorus 1]
Bought Bought, Bought, Bought.......

[Verse 2]
I got this thing, gonna tie your tongue
Step in my ring, you'll be out round one
You want to feel, but you got no touch
You think it's love, but you think too much

[Bridge]
I got it
I got it
I got it

[Verse 3]
I got this thing, gonna break you down
You're crumbling, till you hit the ground
You wanna try, come and have your taste
This thing won't stop, till you can't see straight

[Chorus 2]
Straight, straight, straight.........


[Outro]
I got it, I got it, I got it.........
I got this thing
