Oh, oh

Oh (You dig?)
Oh (Oh)
No such thing as friends

[Chorus]
I don't want no friends, don't want no friends (You dig?)
Rather buy a Benz, don't want no friends (Yeah)
In my pocket, dead presidents (You dig?)
I don't want no friends, don't want no friends (Don't want no friends)
Glock inside my Benz (Benz), no such thing as friends (Friends)
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends (No such thing as)
Glock inside my Benz (You dig?), no such thing as friends (You dig?)

[Verse 1]
Hit that bitch in a Lam'
Taxin' motherfuckers, Uncle Sam (Woo, you dig?)
And I'm off the Xan', don't give a damn (Woo, dig)
When I'm in LA they pull out cams
G-G-Glock in my closet
Showed that bitch that Bar' and now she drippin' like a faucet (Ooh)
Before I kick in the door, bitch, you know a nigga knockin'
Auto-Tune status, bitch, you know that my shit knockin' (You dig?)
If you stealin' swag, I ain't gon' stop it (You dig?)
Ooh, see 'em in the streets and I might drop 'em (You dig?)
Keep that fuck nigga, keep away
You can see it in my 'fit, I'm gettin' paid
See me, you can't see me (You can't see)
I feel like John Cena on this CD (C)
Lil Purpp Bless Your Trap, that's what the streets need (Streets)
Don't owe a nigga shit 'cause you don't feed me (Woo)

[Bridge]
And I pour the mud 'til I'm sleepy (You dig?)
Lil' bitch wanna touch on my pee-pee (You dig?)
I'm a deadstar (You dig?), rockstar (Woo)
I'm a deadstar (You dig?)

[Chorus]
I don't want no friends, don't want no friends (You dig?)
Rather buy a Benz, don't want no friends (Yeah)
In my pocket, dead presidents (You dig?)
I don't want no friends, don't want no friends (Don't want no friends)
Glock inside my Benz (Benz), no such thing as friends (Friends)
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends (No such thing as)
Glock inside my Benz (You dig?), no such thing as friends (You dig?)

[Verse 2]
Sweat, ooh, molly make me sweat (It make me), ooh
Yeah, bitch, I'm a star but I'm still dead, ooh (You dig?), ooh
And I'm with my dawg just like a vet, ooh (You dig?), ooh
Pull up at your trap and get it wet (Fa-fa-fa, dig)
Do-do-do it for my set (For my set, woo)
And I never talk to no feds (Dig)
In LA, I used to sleep with no bed (Chee, chee)
Now I'm a million-dollar nigga in the jet (You dig?)
Slatt

[Chorus]
I don't want no friends, don't want no friends (You dig?)
Rather buy a Benz, don't want no friends (Yeah)
In my pocket, dead presidents (You dig?)
I don't want no friends, don't want no friends (Don't want no friends)
Glock inside my Benz (Benz), no such thing as friends (Friends)
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends
Glock inside my Benz, no such thing as friends (No such thing as)
Glock inside my Benz (You dig?), no such thing as friends (You dig?)

[Outro]
Glo-Glock inside my Benz (You dig?), no such thing as friends (You dig)
