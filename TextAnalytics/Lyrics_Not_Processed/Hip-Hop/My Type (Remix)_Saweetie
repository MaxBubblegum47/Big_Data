[Intro: Saweetie]
Hennessy on my lips, take a lil' sip
Privacy  on the door, I'ma make that shit grip
Icy  (My type)
We got London on da Track
 (My type)

[Chorus: Saweetie]
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's  my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch  big, ooh, that's good pipe
Bad bitch, I'ma ride the dick all night
Rich  nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
That's my type, nigga, that's my type

[Post-Chorus: Saweetie & 
Jhené Aiko

New  wrist, new whip (
Ayy
), ride around dipped (
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
)
I can see why all these basic hoes pissed

[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko & 
Saweetie
]
I like a BBC in some BBC
That's the type of shit that make a bitch DTD
That's drop them drawers, I'ma lock them jaws
You ain't never had a bitch from Slauson, yeah
I like the type to eat the pussy 'til I levitate
I'm the type to make him beat it up, then meditate (
Yeah
)
I don't really got a type, don't discriminate
I just need good dick, ayy

[Pre-Chorus & 
Jhené Aiko
]
Hennessy on my lips, take a lil' sip (
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Yeah

Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
That's my type, nigga, that's my type

[Verse 2: Saweetie]
New wrist, new whip, ride around dipped
I can see why all these basic hoes pissed
Bust down wrist, not a bustdown bitch (Uh)
Said I want your man, no, the fuck, I don't, sis (Uh-uh)
If he a rich nigga, why he still hitting licks?
Nigga spendin' bread but he still can't hit
Bitch, please (Bitch), Lamborghini keys
Pussy dripping ice, he get flown out to me
Bitch, please, I want a man with the B's (Yeah)
The pussy from the Bay, goin' dumb on the D

[Pre-Chorus: Saweetie]
Hennessy on my lips, take a lil' sip
Privacy on the door, I'ma make that shit grip

[Chorus: Saweetie]
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
Bad bitch, I'ma ride the dick all night
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
That's my type, nigga, that's my type

[Verse 3: Yung Miami]
Hop out the foreign car swingin' my inches (Yup)
All these C's on me like I'm Crippin' (Bitch)
All this ice on me, bitch, I'm drippin'
Never been a quick fuck, more so a ticket (Miami)
I go viral when I talk, period
Bitch, I'm a boss
Watch look small but it cost
I ain't never been bougie
Pull up in the hood, it's a movie
Tights all up in my coochie

[Pre-Chorus: Saweetie]
Hennessy on my lips, take a lil' sip
Privacy on the door, I'ma make the shit grip

[Chorus: Saweetie]
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
Bad bitch, I'ma ride the dick all night
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
