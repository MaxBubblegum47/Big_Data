[Intro]
La-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la

[Verse 1]
I like your smile, I like your vibe
I like your style
But that's not why I love you
And I, I like the way
You're such a star
But that's not why I love you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, do you feel, do you feel me?
Do you feel what I feel, too?
Do you need, do you need me?
Do you need me?

[Chorus]
You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you
I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you is you
Being you, just you
Yeah, the reason I love you
Is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you

[Post-Chorus]
La-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la

[Verse 2]
I like the way you misbehave
When we get wasted
But that's not why I love you
And how you keep your cool
When I am complicated
But that's not why I love you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, do you feel, do you feel me?
Do you feel what I feel, too?
Do you need, do you need me?
Do you need me?

[Chorus]
You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you
And I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you is you
Being you, just you
Yeah, the reason I love you
Is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you

[Bridge]
Yeah, oh, oh
Even though we didn't make it through
I am always here for you
Yeah, oh, oh

[Chorus]
You're so beautiful
But that's not why I love you
I'm not sure you know
That the reason I love you is you
Being you, just you
Yeah, the reason I love you
Is all that we've been through
And that's why I love you

[Outro]
La-la, la-la-la-la (Oh, oh)
La-la, la-la-la-la (That's why I love you)
La-la, la-la-la-la (Oh, oh)
La-la, la-la-la-la (That's why I love you)
