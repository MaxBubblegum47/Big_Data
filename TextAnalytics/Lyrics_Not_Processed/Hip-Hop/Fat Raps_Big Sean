[Verse 1: Chip Tha Ripper]
Uh-huh SLAB Ent, boy 
Good lookin' out Chuck
Pulled up to the hand car wash like blaow
Just the outside my nigga gone wipe me down
Know I gotta couple dollars for you when you done
Roll the window back up, roll the blunt, cut UGK back up
Cut the AC back up, gettin' kinda hot in here
Benihana leftover, weed smoke, and I'm in here
Let me volunteer to get you niggas minds right
Getcha funds up instead of chasin' after limelight
But since I'm all good I might go and see what's good
With these pretty girls for one night
So I whipped around to the spot I knew was poppin
Parked then we hopped out and hopped in, no problem
Soon as we got in eyebrows raised up
I'm Mr. Taper Fade Cut whip the Escalade truck
In the party lookin for Ms. Not-Too-Bougie
With a booty and know how to roll doobies and do me

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Bitches think I'm living out my car
All these shoe boxes and shit
Don't confuse it boo, this stuff I just bought
Before I came to scoop you
Coulda dropped it off, but I wanted you to see it
Confident but not conceited
Yeah, I like my grapes and my weed seedless
Gettin pussy with my fathers features, believe it
If you missed it, then I bet somebody out there seen
It, TwitPic my outfit, bitches stalk my comments
Jets fool
What they say I can't do first on my list of things to do
If the broad got wireless at her crib I fall through
Got e-mails to read, as she break down my tree
Reach my cell phone, turn the TV down for me
It was kinda ironic, cause I had the papers
She had the chronic, 
the Hornets beat the Supersonics
Inhale the vapors from the smoking volcano
I'm thirsty need some Waterboy, Captain Insano

[Big Sean]
Aye, in this lifetime you only get richer or not
So hoes jump for my balls like they tipped off the rock
I get it from my dad, guess I'm a chip off the block
Now I'm up in Cleveland to grab Chip off the block
Now whip off the lot with a bad bitch, ass thick
And tits so I slipped off the top
Yeah, Bitch I'm the man, forever gettin' chose
I party everynight and it's never gettin old
The story of your life is probably never gettin' told
Them tickets to your show is probably never gettin' sold
I might just cop some shit from Somerset
New York to LA, I beat the sunset
Your girl show me L-O-V-E I dropped the O and E and just took the LV
That's Louis Vuitton luggage every time you see my passport
Damier print got me lookin like a chessboard
Ahaha
