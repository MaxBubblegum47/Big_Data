[Verse 1]
Now I'm living on my heaven shit

Told her kick rock and she kickin' up pebbles, bitch
Slide with a truck 'cause I stay on my Travis shit

We in the foreign, hit the gas when the pedal shift (Skrrt)
Baby my sign, man, for her, I go steppin' shit
There ain't no time, 'cause for you, this forever shit (Ooh, ooh)

Fuckin' on me in the studio
Fallin' for me got you moody, though
