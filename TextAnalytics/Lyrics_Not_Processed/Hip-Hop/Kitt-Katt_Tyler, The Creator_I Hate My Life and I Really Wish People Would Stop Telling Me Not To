[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Fuck you heard? We got big stacks, we got big stacks
Big cars with the big cribs and the big cats
Big dogs doin' big shit, nigga, get back
All that talk, you can miss that with the chit-chat

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked, nigga
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked, yuh
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked, bitch

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked, nigga

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, what you heard? I bring the thunder like Oklahoma
Ain't you heard that the boy kinda nuts, I'm macadamia
And the shit you build cold make you do the Macarena
Like a Bug with a bad paint job, it probably say you shit

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Fuck you heard? We got big stacks, we got big stacks
Big cars with the big cribs and the big cats
Big dogs doin' big shit, nigga, get back
All that talk, you can miss that with the chit-chat

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked, nigga
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked, yuh
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked, bitch

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked, nigga

[Verse 2: $ILKMONEY]
What's the word? I bring a Hummer hot as Coronas
Hit your curb with a 12-guage buck lodged in the chamber
With a bitch who deal dope like kazoo, color Topanga
You a scrub with a nice, quaint job that wanna be us

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Fuck you heard? We got big stacks, we got big stacks
Big cars with the big cribs and the big cats
Big dogs doin' big shit, nigga, get back
All that talk, you can miss that with the chit-chat

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked, nigga
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked, yuh
Break you off like a KitKat, get your shit cracked, bitch

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked, nigga
Getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked
You can getcha, getcha, getcha, get your shit cracked, nigga
