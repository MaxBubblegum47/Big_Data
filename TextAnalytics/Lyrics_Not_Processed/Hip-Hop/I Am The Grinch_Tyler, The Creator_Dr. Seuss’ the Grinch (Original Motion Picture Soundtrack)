[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I am the Grinch, Cindy Lou who?
I live in Who-ville, who are you?
I got a dog, his name is Max
Coffee in my cup, that is a fact
I was in snow, ain't need a coat
Max with the sled, off with their head
I don't like love, I don't like fun
When I'm around, Christmas is done

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Fletcher Jones]
(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
Hey, how you doing, you scum? It's a pleasure to meet you
(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
I'm here to ruin your day, this will end in defeat
(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
I get to ridin' and ridin' and ridin' around
(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
That's what they call me when they talk about me around the town

[Post-Chorus: Fletcher Jones & Tyler, The Creator]
You're the Grinch, you're the Grinch (That's me!)
You're so problematic, you're the Grinch (Hello)
You're the Grinch, you're the Grinch (I'm guilty)
You're so problematic, you're the Grinch (Yeah, yeah)
You're the Grinch, you're the Grinch (At your service)
You're so problematic, you're the Grinch (Nice to meet you)
You're the Grinch, you're the Grinch (Okay)
You're so problematic

[Break: Tyler, the Creator]
(That's ice on 'em, I)
(That's ice on 'em, I)
(That's ice on 'em, I)
(That's ice on 'em, I)
(That's ice on 'em, that's)
Ayo

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
25, 25, 25, 25
25 days in a month
25 days ain't enough where I don't give a—(wait a minute!)
25 days got the lock with the chain at the door
Don't knock, no gifts over here

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
I don't smell nothing in the air
You can take that over there and I don't really care
Tell your homeboy in the red suit to chill
Before I ban him from Who-ville
I ain't playing with you

[Bridge: Fletcher Jones & Tyler, The Creator]
11 days coming up boy
(Ice on, 'em)
25 ain't enough, yeah
(Ice on, 'em)
I just hope you have a Merry Christmas, yeah
(Ice on, 'em)
Jingle Bells, can you hear them bells
(Ice on, 'em)
It's them Jingle Bells in the front, yeah
(Ice on)
I just hope you have a Merry—

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
25, 25, 25, 25
25 days in a month
25 days ain't enough where I don't give a—wait a minute!
25 days got the lock with the chain at the door
Don't knock, no gifts over here

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Fletcher Jones]
(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
Hey, how you doing, you scum? It's a pleasure to meet you
(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
I'm here to ruin your day to swoop in and defeat
(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
I get to ridin’ and ridin’ and ridin’ around
(Show me some love)
I am the Grinch
That's what they call me when they talk about me around the town

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
That's me!
Hello
Nice to meet you
