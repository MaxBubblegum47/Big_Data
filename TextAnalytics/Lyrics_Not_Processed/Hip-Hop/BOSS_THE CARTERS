[Intro: Beyoncé]
Mm, mm

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Ain't nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it, boss
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one
Ain't nothing to it (there's nothing!) boss

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Heh, I paid the cost
Who gon' take it all? (take it all)
I record then I ball (then I ball!)
I ignored a lot of calls (click, click)
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothin', I ain't got no time
Got that dinero on my mind
Ohh, I got real problems just like you (bitch!)
Tell that bitch, "I don't like you" 
(I don't fuck with you!)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Ain't nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) boss
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) I boss
Ohhh, real one
Uh, I'm a boss
Oh oh oh oh ohhh, oh yeah

[Verse 2: JAY-Z & 
Beyoncé
]
Let me get 'em, B, yeah
Hundred million crib, three million watch, all facts
No cap; false nigga, you not a boss, you got a boss
Niggas getting jerked, that shit hurts, I take it personally
Niggas rather work for the man than to work with me
Just so they can pretend they on my level, that shit is irkin' to me
Pride always goeth before the fall, almost certainly
It's disturbing what I gross (
what I gross!
)
Survey says you not even close (
not even close
)
Everybody's bosses 'til it's time to pay for the office
'Til them invoices separate the men, from the boys
Over here we measure success by how many people successful next to you
Here we say you broke if everybody is broke except for you
Boss!

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Ain't nothing to it, real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) boss (boss, boss, boss)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) I boss
Ohhh, real one
Uh, I'm a boss
Oh oh oh oh ohhh, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Ain't nothing to it, I bossed up out my momma whip
My great-great-grandchildren already rich
That's a lot of brown chil'ren on your Forbes list
Frolickin' around my compound on my fortress, boss (boss, boss, boss)
Ohh, I be ridin' 'round with my seat reclinin'
Droppin' my daughter off at school every morning
We slammin' car doors
I be true ballin' on these bum whores
You ain't talkin' 'bout nothing, I ain't got no time, boss
Chill, tell them paps they gotta relax (you tried it!)
Toes in the sand, momma gettin' fat (snack)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) boss (boss)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) real one (real one)
Ain't nothing to it (nothin' to it) I boss
Ooh, real one
Uh, I'm a boss
Oh oh oh oh ohhh, oh yeah

[Outro: Beyoncé & 
Blue Ivy
]
Ohhh, ohh, I'm a boss
Shout out to Rumi and Sir, love, Blue
