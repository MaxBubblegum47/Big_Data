Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse: The Game]
...Lost a legend but Vanessa lost a husband in the dark

[Verse: Big Sean]
Fuck twenty-four Seven, I'm goin' twenty-four eight
Fuck twenty-four Seven, I'm goin' twenty-four eight
That's Magic, and he know what it took to be great
41, five rings, and it still ain't addin' up, what
Was in L.A. when it happened, Hit-Boy track it up
God send me a sign, I'm outside lookin' up

[Verse: The Game]
I was courtside when you scored 60
Now you in heaven with my nigga from the 60s
Black Mamba, neighborhood Nipsey
That's the type of love you throw and it come back like a frisbee
Kobe with the 'fro, Kobe with the lineup
Torn achilles limpin' to the free throw line, yeah
I cherished the moments I seen you go at 'Bron
But my favorite moment seein' you jumpin' in Shaq's arms, yeah
Ain't no realer than that
Turn to a blank page, Kobe could fill it with stats
As I shed tears chuggin' this Hennessy back
What you do when people die and God ain't sendin' 'em back
Question Everything
