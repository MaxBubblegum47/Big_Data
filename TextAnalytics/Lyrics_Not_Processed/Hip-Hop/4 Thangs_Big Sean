[Intro: Freddie Gibbs & 
Big Sean
]
Quit playin' with me
Hit-Boy
 (
Hol' up
)

[Chorus: Big Sean & 
Freddie Gibbs
]
She keep calling me babe, I said "That's not my name"
Million dollars, million followers, ho, that's not the same
And I just washed off the chicken, baby, that's not cocaine
Shit's so hot, you got two hundred, you can get like four thangs, yeah

[Verse: Freddie Gibbs, 
Big Sean
 & 
Both
]
Gangsta G, gorilla pimp, stay with banana
I fuck with Sean Don, he run the D like 
Barry Sanders
Trophies, mantels, Billups, how shit get handled
I pray my life go over easy and I never scramble
She sent a text like "Can we talk?" Bitch, I'm not Tevin Campbell
I walk in, I'm deckin' it, makin' an entrance, I know where the exit is
We kick them hoes out, ain't no room service, we ain't bringing no breakfast in
Got an oval office in my house, bitch suck me off like a president
I'm talkin' Jefferson, Edison, Clinton
So much pussy, look like I'm sellin' it
And the polices know that I'm sellin' it
I did the one and the two with the heroin
And my nigga was snitchin', he tellin' it
I had to jump off a war with the Mexicans
Gotta get me a brand new plug
I run out of dope and I'm out of my element
Yeah, uh, bitch, Google my government, but that's not my name
Million dollars, million followers, ho, that's not the same
And I just washed off the chicken, baby, that's not cocaine, yeah
I give you the game, I don't play for the love of the game
Ho, I play for the rings
Every ho that I got is a side bitch
I ain't never gon' fuck on the main
Better Alex Trebek, I don't answer those questions
Jeopardize how far we done came
We are not one in the same, we can rock the same thing
And it won't look the same
These bitches, they want me to wife 'em, but I just one night 'em
Good bitches, they 
know me, it's all in my veins

[Chorus: Big Sean & 
Freddie Gibbs
]
She keep calling me babe, I said "That's not my name"
Million dollars, million followers, ho, that's not the same
And I just washed off the chicken, baby, that's not cocaine
Shit's so hot, you got two hundred, you can get like four thangs, yeah

[Outro: Big Sean]
