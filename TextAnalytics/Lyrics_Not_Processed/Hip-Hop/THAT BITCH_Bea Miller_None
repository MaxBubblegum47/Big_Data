[Verse 1]
I've been runnin' my mouth around the corner
Chasin' it down the street (Bitch)
Cashing my words like I'm a billionaire
But I don't have food to eat
And I keep talkin' like I'm taller than the trees (Bitch)
But my eyes never see much higher than five feet
And I keep on tellin' everyone the truth
But maybe that's not the move (Bitch)
And everyone wants to hear a strong opinion
If it's the same as you (You're a crazy bitch)
And they say honesty is the best policy (Bitch)
If that were true, don't think all of my friends would hate me

[Chorus]
Society is suckin' on your dick
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch (You're a crazy bitch)
Society is suckin' on your dick
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch

[Verse 2]
There was a time, this guy, he tried to tell me
"Men can cheat, women can't" (Bitch) (Fuck, I can't)
Then he proceeded to ask me out on a date
And I fuckin' laughed
"If you're a woman, you were made to pleasure me" (Bitch)
But out in public, hide them shoulders underneath

[Chorus]
Society is suckin' on your dick
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch (You're a crazy bitch)
Society is suckin' on your dick
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch

[Bridge]
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I'm that motherfuckin' bitch
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
You should be suckin' on my clit (You're a crazy bitch)
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I said, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a bitch
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I dare you, stop me

[Chorus]
Society is suckin' on your dick (On your dick)
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch (I'm a bitch)
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch
Society is suckin' on your dick (On your dick)
And since I got a pussy, I'm a bitch (I'm a bitch)
And since you are a dude, yeah, you can tell the truth
But as soon as I do, I'm a bitch (You're a crazy bitch)

[Outro]
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
Watch me
(If I have to be, I'ma be that bitch)
I said, I'll be that bitch
So stop me
Well, that song's done
Song's done, you're done
Fuck! Fuck!
Oh my god! A banger!
