[Intro: Maurette Brown & 
Trippie Redd
]
DJ on the beat so it's a banger
(It ain't over, it ain't over)
(It ain't over, it ain't over)
(But the Impossible)
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't talk to strangers
Since a youngin', I've been totin' bangers
I might take that lil' bitch to Topanga
I said, "Stop, little bitch, you in danger"
Yeah-eah, you in danger
I might take your lil' ass to Topanga
Just don't move like no motherfuckin' stranger
Know I tote bangers, boom-boom-boom-boom
Stop, you in danger

[Chorus]
I can take you to Topanga
Open my hand like Jesus and save ya
Know I'm known to tote bangers
Said, "Boom-boom-boom, you in danger"
Stop that now, you in danger
Stop right now, you in danger
Stop that now, you in danger
Stop right now, you in danger, yeah

[Verse]

Hit you in your stomach, we tote 'em in public
