[Verse 1]
I got cash and they mad I pull up in that jag
My shoe red your boo mad cause I'm shitting on they ass
I got cash I pop tags rob me pop your ass
I stay flee I'm the man video on demand
Stripper bitches, fat ass, fire face, you that mad
Smoking dope that gas, savager hammertime
Calling up Jason Nine straight A down the drive
Thick bitches down to ride that's why they mad at me
10 dicks to meet the president now
Gotta do the whole squad to be the shit now
I gotta deal thinking I'm the shit now
I'll never change never wife a bitch now

[Chorus]
You wanna meet the president you gotta meet the bang bros
Hella bank rolls all them bank rolls ain't yours
Spending flexing so much cash that it can't fold
Up and coming rappers man I don't see those
Boy all that cuffing you should be a P.O
So much designer shit that I can give away clothes
All these new niggas all that shit rapping is old
To meet the president you gotta meet the bang bros

[Verse 2]
Hold up they know we shit like Sho nuff
Can't sleep on us like pour up
Hole in them just like donuts we go nuts
D-Thang shares thots, SB shares thots, Chino shares thots
But I can't wife a thot see its levels to this shit
She fuck a bang bros and you married to this bitch
A salad I got all types of carrots on my wrist
One night I don't need a lot of shit
These bitches is crazy these bitches amaze me
These niggas don't phase me money and the streets raised me
The industry crazy just a problem
I'm a young nigga I'm just chasing me some dollars

[Chorus]
You wanna meet the president you gotta meet the bang bros
Hella bank rolls all them bank rolls ain't yours
Spending flexing so much cash that it can't fold
Up and coming rappers man I don't see those
Boy all that cuffing you should be a P.O
So much designer shit that I can give away clothes
All these new niggas all that shit rapping is old
To meet the president you gotta meet the bang bros
