[Verse 1]
Every freckle's where it's supposed to be
I play your body like a symphony
Unless you're gonna add on my last name
Then you don't needa change a thing

[Verse 2]
Autumn colors blended in your eye
Your creator must've took his time
Don’t you switch up, don’t you rearrange
No, you don’t needa change a thing

[Chorus]
'Cause when I wake up in the morning
I kinda feel like I’m a king
'Cause when I see you there beside me
No, I would not change a thing

[Verse 3]
You don’t needa put no make-up on
You wake up looking like a Sam Cooke song (Oh lord)
Don’t do nothing, keep it just the same
No, you don’t needa change a thing

[Verse 4]
Oh, you’re Carolina on a perfect day
You look like April, baby, if I may
And if I had to, darling, I would pay
You to never, ever change a thing

[Chorus]
'Cause when I wake up in the morning
I kinda feel like I’m a king
'Cause when I see you there beside me
No, I would not change a thing

[Bridge]
'Cause when the lord freestyled your body
He didn’t make not one mistake
And though the TV tells you different
No, you don’t needa change a thing
Change
No
Change

[Chorus]
'Cause when I wake up in the morning
I kinda feel like I’m a king
'Cause when I see you there beside me
I would not change a, no
And when the lord freestyled your body
He didn’t make not one mistake
And though at times, I know that you hate yourself
I would not change a, I would not change a thing

[Outro]
Change
Ahh, yeah, don't
I won't change
Hey, hey, hey
