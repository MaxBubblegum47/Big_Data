[Intro]
This one look like that one
That one match this one
Fuck it

Money, money, money
IIt's young Khalifa man
And I got money hoes money and hoes
Sick, money and hoes

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Big money talkin to you
Mothafucka that's cause big money brought it to you
I be stuntin while them little niggas sayin nothin
High ceilings high hoes
High prices for my clothes
And I dont even pay for it
Barely know who made the shit
Meet a bitch take a bitch
Straight back to that big crib
Let you roll some rapper weed
Put you on some new shit
Hit this weed I show you how I do this man
My excuse is I'm in Cali so my smoke's highly exclusive
And my bitch bad my moneys through the roof
Your money short you lookin mad, you Danny Bonaduce
Bitch Im jumpin in my coup
I'm rollin something that tastes like fruit
And I hear them niggas talkin shit
But there ain't that much that they can do
When I got a bitch in your city
You should try when you see her
Never trippin on no hoes
Nigga, what you thought we gettin money over her

[Hook]
I'm ballin hard, my niggas in the same gang
I do it big my niggas do the same thing
I'm throwin signs its lookin like I gang bang
I'm on the team its lookin like I gang bang
I'm rollin up my niggas smoke the same thing
I'm smokin weed my bitch she smoke the same thing
I'm throwin signs its looking like I gang bang
I'm on the team its lookin like I gang bang

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I tell a bitch bow down
To a mothafuckin g ho
I work hard I drink slow
But I never keep drinks low
Smokey smokey, cause im a chief ho
Sippin on pinot grigio, richie ho greedy ho
Got me everything like I copped me a genie ho
My car look like a building
Diamonds dancin on my wrist bitch I'm 10 feet tall
When I'm standin on top of my dick
You a sucka ho sucka ho im success
I feel like a million dollars, bitch im up next
Money in my hand I dont need no handout
And they all got they hands up
Cause they fuck with me hands down (down down down)
And the car I push got more tent than a campground
And my picture is always on your bitch background
Like pada, its just me and Cyhi
Young enough to be your son
But she call me big papa
She gave me her o nana
Then I dissapear like tada
Smokin on that tie-dye
Now who the fuck gon stop us

[Hook]
I'm ballin ho my niggas in the same gang
I do it big my niggas do the same thing
I'm throwin signs its lookin like I gang bang
I'm on the team its lookin like I gang bang
I'm rollin up my niggas smoke the same thing
I'm smokin weed my bitch she smoke the same thing
I'm throwin signs its looking like I gang bang
I'm on the team its lookin like I gang bang

[Outro]
Yeaa thats right nigga
Probably got your bitch in a trance
I do it
Niggas got me laughin that shit funny
And my nigga Wiz got this shit ho
