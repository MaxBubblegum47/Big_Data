[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Yeah, Bone Enterpri$e in tha muthafuckin house, nigga!
Yo, y'all muthafucka's that didn't think we was comin' out
Check this shit out: I got my nigga Layzie Bone in the muthafuckin' house
Bizzy Bone in the muthafuckin' house, Wish Bone
And the muthafuckin' bomb is in the muthafuckin' house
We gonna do a little something like this...
Yeah...Now Krayzie Bone has got the gun
So let's proceed with lychin', yo
My uzi weighs a ton
So now you know what I'm benchin', ho
The weapon is kept in inside the trunk of the 9-ball
Put triggers on niggas
In rivers, that's where they find y'all
So drop to your knees
That's the position, assume it bitch
You slip and you're soon to get
Fucked up by a lunatic
Decide to pack a gat
Well that's the way I prefer
Your forty-four might do damage
But see my streetsweeper's much worse
My shotguns are cocked
Make sure you're stayin' in line
Me twenty two is no fun
So let me play with me nine
I'm steppin' with the Enterpri$e
My only army brigade, and if I drop
Then I just throw this like a hand-grenade

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
You see no pistol's in the holster
Watch the dot's on your forehead
I'm gunnin' while you're runnin
And there's plenty of bloodshed
There's no sympathy over killin
I already warned you
You crossed the path of a maniac
So now you're a goner
Don't ever step up in my face
Cause stupid bitch, you'll get served
Get on my dick, and stop steppin'
I'm startin to loose all my nerve
Your thirty-eights, your forty-fives
Ain't doin' shit to me
Punk, cause once you're disabled
Believe you're gonna get stomped
Cause you ain't nothin' but a ho, and of course
I hope you get smoked. I put a gauge to your throat
And it is murder Bizz wrote
See, I'm unloadin' while you're foldin' on your niggas
The usual, doublecross me
And I'll bet that I'll be laughin' at your funeral

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Now, see, I'm robbin' and killin' and stealin'
Makin' a dope-dealin', that's what I do daily
Cause Layzie gotta make a livin'
And I don't give a damn
I take your life for what you got
If you got what I want, then you gonna straight-up get shot
A bullet to your forehead, there be a couple more dead, bitch
Yeah, I perp like I'm your nigga just to get your ass misled
That's when I rolled up in your house and take your shit away
Thought you had a friend, but I'm a nigga gettin' paid
Real swift, here's a gift, comin' at you is a bullet
The psychopathic nigga on the trigger, they gotta pull it
And I ain't never had no gratitude
Layzie Bone be crazy killin' with a ganksta attitude
Buck, The Enterpri$e is breakin' 'em down
Me breakin' 'em down, man
Bump the Enterpri$e is breakin' 'em down
Me breakin' 'em down, man
Me breakin' down, me breakin' down
Me breakin' down, man
Wish Bone, come down, man

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
Now we hittin' niggas up, and we ain't comin' cheap
You wanna jump? Feel froggish, muthafucka, leap
We gettin' drunk, start shit, drinkin' sixty-four's
I brought a liter. Where's your posse?
Smack your fuckin' ho. I got your bitch on my dick
Because I'm here for my cap down
When steppin' through C-Town
You better be strapped down
The bigger my trigger
The deader your nigga is found on your doorstep
So how do you figure that you'll be the one
To unload in my fuckin' chest
So when you catch me steppin'
I got the weapon that is kept in on my hip and
Why you trip and find your clip
And tell your bitch to suck my dick
Wish Bone'll pop that ass quick, fool
Don't try to fuck with this ganksta attitude
Buck, me breakin' 'em down
Once again me breakin' 'em down
Krayzie Bone, come break 'em down
Krayzie Bone come break ya down

[Verse 5: Krayzie Bone]
I'm steppin' in my hood at night
And I'm low up on cash
So gimme everything you got
Cause Bone assualt your ass
Oh, so you wanna play hero, sucka?
Fuck that shit. Die, muthafucka
Never showin' favoritism when I'm blastin'
When I grab my gun
I play the role of an assassin
The K to the R to the A to the Y
To the Z to the I to the E
And steppin' with Layzie Bone
Also the B-I-double Z up in the house
So come prepared
I ain't talkin' with rides
I'm talkin' about with hand grenades
Pistols, uzis, and nines
So get the shit loaded up
You better be quick when you're duckin' out
I'm standin' there smilin'
When I watch ya duck from the buckshots

[Verse 6: Bizzy Bone]
I got some unfinsihed business
So won't ya's come up with me
K, bring the P-U-M-P
Lay, bring the G-A-G-E
Cause there's this gang all down the way
We gotta put 'em in check
Cause that O.G. was talkin' shit
I'm gonna blow his brain off his neck
We get up in the smug and start to ride kinda slow
And now we're in their territory
So we let all our triggers go
Twenty niggas drop to the sound of that auto gun
I seen that O.G. gettin' up as he began to run
I grab my nine; it's time them niggas took a loss
Put on my mask, and turn the fuckin' lights off
See, speeded up, right beside, and he knew he was hit
The last words that he heard was, "Rest in Peace, bitch"

[Verse 7: Layzie Bone]
Layzie Bone is the gangsta
And now you know it's my occupation
The jackin's in progress; it's a critical operation
The object is murder
I'm the number one assassin, it's Layzie Bone
I'll put your ass up in a casket, bitch
Be aware when I'm steppin' with the Enterpri$e
The money, we bankin'
Cause we them criminals organized
You'll take what you got, and give a shot
And so watch me pick 'em
I hunt up a sucka, and then unload on my victim
It's like, (gunshot) to his legs, (gunshots)
To his chest, another shot in the face
The nigga's put to rest
Yeah, like I said
I'm never actin' like a nice dude
We got them what?
Them ganksta attitudes. Nigga
(Series of gunshots)
Unit two requesting four additional units for shots fired (fired, fired)
