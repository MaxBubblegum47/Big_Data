[Verse 1]
Closer than I thought we'd end up anyway
Never cared you left in fear too hard to stay
Control all my wavelengths till I find a better guy
I don't know how you do it to me time after time

[Pre-Chorus]
I can read you clearly like a magazine
Pictures of your past are visible to me
Clearly, like a magazine
Pictures of your past are visible to me

[Chorus]
Tough guy
He's Mr. Tough Guy
He makes the girls cry
Mr. Tough Guy

[Verse 2]
Text my phone I don't reply ignore your calls
If I was interested I'd make that clear, not anymore
You really think that I'm the one to fall for all those lies
Stupid just to think you were a waste of time

[Pre-Chorus]
I can read you clearly like a magazine
Pictures of your past are visible to me
Clearly, like a magazine
Pictures of your past are visible to me

[Chorus]
Tough guy
He's Mr. Tough Guy
He makes the girls cry
Mr. Tough Guy

[Bridge]
Tryna wind me up like that
Hoping that I'll crawl right back
Kind of funny how you just assume
That my life still revolves 'round you
Tryna wind me up like that
Hoping that I'll crawl right back
Kind of funny how you just assume
That my life still revolves 'round you

[Chorus]
Tough guy (Tough guy)
He's Mr. Tough Guy ('Cause he's a tough guy)
He makes the girls cry (They cry, they cry)
Mr. Tough Guy (He's Mr. Tough Guy)

[Outro]
Tough guy
Tough guy
