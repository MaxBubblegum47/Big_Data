Diamond on my wrist and it look like glue
Diamond on my wrist and it look like glue
Walk in the club and I flex like ooh
Walk in the club and I flex like ooh
Maison Margiela all over my shoe

Pull up swerving in a coupe
Pull up swerving in a coupe
Pull up swerving in a coupe
Pull up swerving in a coupe
Move them bricks to the bando like ooh

Walk in the club and I flex like ooh

Made a couple bands water whippin' (Brrr)
Take a nigga bitch, go missing, ooh

Move them bricks to the bando like, ooh
Diamond on my wrist and it look like glue
Walk in the club and I flex like, ooh
