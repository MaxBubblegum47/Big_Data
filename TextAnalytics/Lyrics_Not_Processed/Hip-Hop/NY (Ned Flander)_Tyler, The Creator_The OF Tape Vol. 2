[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Carter Wong, bring the challenge from the eight masters
Hodgy Long one of them bastards that would head bash ya
Yeah, we Skate Mental, but the meaning of a Thrasher
Is to whiplash out and leave you pussy niggas fractured
I need meds from a mental institution
'fore my brain is revenged, free throw finger shootin'
Record them screamin, interwine them in a loop, then
Take the garbage out back, I pay the homage in fact
I'm throwing T-Bones to these wannabe me clones
And their wannabe me clothes, 
bitch I'm actually old
I spin ya like the cover we on,
 
you're in between the pages
I'm 21 now been running these Fairfax blocks for ages
Organic for breakfast, 
free-ranging on stages
It's twelve-noon on my clock, engaged for 12 Gauges
I spit the plague, and don't believe it be a pagan
I'll send your wife dead photos of you taken by Sagan, bitch

[Interlude]
Oye pero ya déjame en paz chingado. No mas me están persiguiendo hablándome de una bola de babosadas como si yo fuera a saber lo que están diciendo. Yo no se lo que es un pinche "odd future." ¿Que es eso? ¿Que es un "odd future?" Yo no se que. Es eso pero vale mas que se vaya mucho a la verga con sus estupideces

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
This that we shit hot shit, piss off custodians
Get rich and marry fat﻿ bitch Lamar Odiom
I’m rich bitch, and y'all's jelly as that jar of petroleum
That I had used when I eloped with him and 40 Mormons and
I'm planning on firing Clancy, ain't no damn controlling him, boy
You can't carry this, them Cannon Nickelodeon boy
My boy Domo higher than fat bitches sodium
And nuggets greener than the fucking can my Arizona's in
I'm sneaking in your kid's ear lobe "Oh, no! It's him! Goblin!"
Dropped like the soap in the tub
Now I have have famous friends who like coke and they're drugged
Dancing with me, Jerry Sandusky, and the Pope in the club
Jerry's trying to get a tug but it isn't paying enough
Now if he doubles it I'll tug it in the bathtub with bubbles
And a rubber ducky that I got on tour Kentucky with some groupies
Where I had got lucky with some sucky-sucky trust me honey bunny
If you fuck me you gonna leave with runny nose
I be running in these hoes ain't no condom on, fucking fuck, me
