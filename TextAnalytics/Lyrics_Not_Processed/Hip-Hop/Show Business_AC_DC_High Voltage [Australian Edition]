[Verse 1]
You learn to sing
You learn to play
Why don't the businessmen ever learn to pay?

[Chorus]
That's show business
(Show business)
Show business
(Show business)
Show business
That's the way it goes

[Verse 2]
You play in halls
You play in bars
You're climbing walls
Chasing stars

[Chorus]

[Solo 1]

[Verse 3]
You pay the man
You pay your dues
When it's all gone
Oh, you sing the blues

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
You wanna roll
You wanna rock
But you find it hard
If your guitar's in hock

[Chorus]

[Solo 2]

[Verse 5]
You're smokin' butts
They smoke cigars
You're drowned in debt
They drown in bars

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
You pull a chick
Take her home
No use, man
You're worn out to the bone

[Chorus]
