[Hook]
Fell asleep in first class
Hoes calling my phone, but fuck it
I'll get to em when I land
And I ain't trying to land
Cause time is money
So while you worry about the hoes
I kill shows and bag more clothes
It’s Polo: check
These Jordan 4′s: check
These women know what I’m on

[Verse 1 - Wale]
Look, viewin life from the 36th floor
Trying to renovate the game
I ain't happy with the score
Insubordinate for good reason
As I coordinate the perfect feature
A working genius, a work of art
That's how I see it
Cause I can bring you to your dreams like Jesus
Holiday season, Obama’s good neighbour
I ain't talkative neither
But got comma’s in my statement
My bitches fuck me good
In the morning make me bacon
And even when I make em
Mad, still make em naked
And I don’t take no dames out
I just spit my game out
She don’t give her nigga head
Cause I fuck all her brains out
Hey, that's cold-blooded
Hey, these hoes love it
Roll up was $4
Doja was four hundred
Dolce Gabbanna stunting
A young nigga love it
Why ya'll be getting mad?
We only getting money!

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
Okay today I was the freshest in my area
Freshest in my neighborhood
Freshest in America
Fuckin bitches chasing paper
I feel like I’m a terrier
Boi, I’m historical
I cause the hysteria
Ok, whats a better accessory?
My all gold Rolly or the
Bitch that's standing next to me
Or the one in front of me
Or the chick leaving
Lighting reef up like it’s the holiday season
Woah there, woah there
These niggas can’t fuck with me
They're too little
I’m animal, you can’t talk to me
Unless you are Dr. Dolittle
Welcome, welcome to the GOOD life
Heard you had a bad day, well lets make it a good night
But they say we ain't BIG
Turn us to a Suge Knight
Lets swim in alcohol and hop up
On that red-eyed kush flight
And when I’m Old, I’ll
Probably die getting some head
I’m just multiplying my money and dividing the legs

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - B.o.B]
From my shell toes to my brim brim
I’m an old soul with my pimp limp
I roll up and I sip sip
Whole team full of OG’s packing fo-fo’s on the hip hip
But we stay cool, we don’t miss miss
Through the grapevine yeah they diss diss
When they feel safe on some bitch shit
I’m first class on my trip trip
With two chicks, sadistic
We touch down in Moscow and take flicks like click click
She so hysterical, she say my life ain't regular cause
I be doing rich shit, you know, baller shit, etc
