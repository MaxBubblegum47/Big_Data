[Intro: Cardo]
Ayy, tap in, lil' nigga
We 'bout to kill all these niggas, bruh
Have these niggas shook
They gon' be shakin' like strippers, nigga
Shot through your car door, shoutout to Cardo

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
I'm sorry, we strictly gang shit (Yeah)
You ain't gang-gang, look at who you came with (Yeah)
You can't gangbang, you be on that lame shit
I like havin' fun, I can't fuck the same chick (Yeah)

[Verse: Baby Keem]
She gon' suck me like a slurpee, chew me up like Scooby Snacks
She think she too cool for drama when I fuck, I do my dance
Hold up, hold up, hold up, you can't tell me that I don't do the rap
You don't think I lie to you, but I do everyday (Yeah)
Do a nigga bad once I find out where he stay (Yeah)
That's a hit and run, and that's on my uncle grave
I'ma fuck your sister and she want me 'cause I'm violent
Had her in the room and she wasn't bein' silent
'Cause this is Baby Keem, give no sympathy for these hoes
Give her to the crib, I'ma knock her down like free throws
This shit got me hot, she a monster and I know that
She just wanna fuck, but I might just let her blow that (Yeah)
I make blood mad, I'ma take his woe out shoppin' (Yeah, yeah)
What you want, baby? You can get it 'cause you poppin' (Yeah)
I might text my ex, I'm all out of options (Yeah, yeah)
Got a list of hoes that I don't trust, you on my top ten (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
I'm sorry, we strictly gang shit
You ain't gang-gang, look at who you came with (Yeah)
You can't gangbang, you be on that lame shit (Yeah)
I like havin' fun, I can't fuck the same chick
