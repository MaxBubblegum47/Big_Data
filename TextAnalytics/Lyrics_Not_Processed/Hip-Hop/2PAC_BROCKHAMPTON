[Verse: Ameer Vann]
I got some demons on me, they been feeding on me
When I sold prescriptions, and my pill addiction
Fuck the damn detectives, momma called the Reverend
I know she praying for me, but I'm in the shadows
Hella drugs and ammo, kicking doors, my MO
I got some bad habits, I do some shit I shouldn't
My life is on a scale
, I know there's angels on me
All my dead homies, I know they waiting on me
Selling dope from out ya house, I know you praying for me
I know you used to trust me, I miss the chicken nuggets
And the kisses from her, damn I miss you momma

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me, oh yeah
The shadow keep following me
The shadow been following me, oh-wee, oh-wee, oh-wee
Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me, oh yeah
The shadow keep following me
The shadow been following me, oh-wee, oh-wee, oh-wee
Trouble keep following me
