I rock water, diamonds, I'm drippin' but not slippin'

I buy Ferraris like Jordans, I'm Mike and y'all Pippen
Chillin', just me and my millions
Niggas, they all in they feelings
My bitches, I spoil them like they chillens
So persistent, if I want it, I go get it
I'm so slimy, grimy, sheisty but still shinin'
