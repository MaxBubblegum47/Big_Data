[Intro: Jennie]
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love how you love to hate me

[Verse 1: Rosé, 
Jennie
]
Kinda sad that you always been like that
See me making waves and you don't like that
Driving through your puddles going splish, splash
(Splish, splash, splish, splash)
Stressing over nothing, baby, relax
Why you getting angry? I'ma kick back
Only thing I think about is big stacks
(Racks, racks)

[Refrain: Jisoo, 
Rosé
, 
Jennie
]
Negative days, negative nights
Baby, you're wasting all your time
I can't relate, I keep it light
No, no, no drama in my life
 
(Uh)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennie, 
Lisa
, 
both
]
Wake up, 
yeah,
 makeup, 
maybe
I need you?
 
Nah,
 
I been good lately
Blowin'
 
up,
 
workin' busy

[Chorus: Jennie, 
Rosé
, 
Lisa
]
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me

[Verse 2: Jisoo]
I'ma let you fade into the background
Baby, all my shows are gettin' too loud
Keep on turnin' it up when you want me down
(Me down, me down, me down)

[Refrain: Rosé, 
Jennie
]
Negative days, negative nights
Baby, you're wasting all your time
I can't relate, I keep it light
No, no, no drama in my life (Uh)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennie, 
Lisa
, 
both
]
Wake up, 
yeah,
 makeup, 
maybe
I need you?
 
Nah,
 
I been good lately
Blowin'
 
up,
 
workin' busy

[Chorus: Jisoo, 
Rosé
, 
Lisa
]
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me

[Verse 3: Lisa]
Uh, love to hate me, you hate to love me
I'm takin' back what you've taken from me
You're mistaken, honey, this something that
Remind me why I be alone on my own
If I needed you, I'd have you, that I know, hold up
I could do bad by myself, don't need help
One of a kind, the hand that I was dealt, like oh, well
Felt Cupid was stupid, I should have knew it
'Cause I been through it, you wouldn't do it
If it ain't foolish, stupid

[Chorus: Rosé, 
Jisoo
, 
Lisa
, 
Jennie
]
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me
 
(Uh)
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
You ain't worth my love if you only love to hate me
