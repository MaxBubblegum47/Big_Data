Thirty-eight on me, that's end of discussion, ayy
I swear y'all niggas be chattin'
Y'all niggas be cappin', I really be clappin'

It come to that gwalla, that's all that I'm jackin'
Me and my niggas be runnin' through figures
I'm ballin' like Michael, I beat it like Jackson
I'm from the streets where my brother was clapped
And that thirty-eight sleepin' right under my mattress
I ain't no crip but my brother what's crackin'
I'm drippin' that gwalla so nigga what's brackin'?
Word to my hitters, they ain't with the actin'
But we make a movie when niggas say action
Yeah, yeah I wanna ball in the Bentley
Only money call when the goal is the benjis, yeah
I just wanna ball in the big leagues
Money on my line, when it call, peep the earrings, yeah
I'ma get it all to the ceiling
I'ma stack it all 'til it fall from the ceiling, yeah
Diamonds on my arm lookin' chilly
Money on mind, I'ma cop me a building, yeah

Ball like Jordan, yeah ball like six rings, yeah

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
Shawty give me jaw in the Bentley
I do not text her or call, now she miss me
Bitch you know I ball in the big league
I do not flock, diamonds pop, Rice Krispie
And you know my shooters ride with me
I spend a bag, it come back like a frisbee
Now she tryna hop in it with me
We was outside, you was home watchin' Disney
I can never let a fuck nigga trick me
I was just stackin' it up 'til it's six feet
Hit a lick, now your bitch wanna lick me
I was just all in her guts, now she dig me
She say you're all that I listen to
Gave her a physical, shit that I'm smokin' medicinal
We in town, my niggas spinnin' through, they tryna finish you
You fell off, nobody missin' you
She see the VV's and back it up
Diamonds is pitching like CC Sabathia
She keep on bitching, I pack her up
I cannot love her she go get the racks and up
Shawty wanna fuck with a pro though
Pose for the photo, ho that's a no go
These niggas ain't gettin' no dough
Used to run off with your plates on my dolo

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
Yeah I wanna ball in the big league, yeah
Yeah I wanna ball in the Bentley, yeah
Yeah I wanna ball in the Bentley
Ball like Jordan, yeah ball like six rings, yeah
Yeah I wanna ball in the big league, yeah
Yeah I wanna ball in the Bentley, yeah
Yeah I wanna ball in the Bentley
Ball like Jordan, yeah ball like six rings, yeah
That boy not gettin' no substance
Deep in the stack, we dip under the substance
Sippin' the cup with the substance
Thirty it's on me, that's six and I'm bustin', yeah
Yeah I wanna ball in the big league, yeah
Yeah I wanna ball in the Bentley, yeah
Yeah I wanna ball in the Bentley
Ball like Jordan, yeah ball like six rings, yeah
