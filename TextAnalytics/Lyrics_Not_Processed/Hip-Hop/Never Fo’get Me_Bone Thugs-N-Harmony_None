(Akon)

(Hook)
I'm gonna make sure you never forget me

Goin' through these struggles everyday on this pavement
In every hood I see 'em doin' the same
There's a lot a haters that don't want me to make it
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
Oh Ay Oh !

(Krayzie Bone)

(Verse 1)
When I'm dead n' gone they gon' remember me
As being one of the livest, genuine ghetto survivor
When they gain terror inside, I pop in they mind
A silent killa, straight outta the ghetto, a grimy nigga
My lyrics more potent than a vipers venom, one bit could
Kill em', when I get in em' niggas never knew what hit em
Legends
For what we done did on these streets, n for what we
Done spit on these records
Blessings
We take em' and put em' on beats and give em back no
Questions
Grandaddy of the mid-west
Krayzie Jackson
The lyrical serial killa
A felon, the innocent is askin' about the mind I master
When it comes to the rhymes I'm faster than half these
Niggas rappin' 
When it comes the the grind I'm mashin' no time
For second chances
When it a goes down and they put me in my grave
" Fuck Em' All " across my tombstone and burry me
With my gauge

(Akon)

(Hook)
Goin' through these struggles everyday on this pavement
In every hood I see 'em doin' the same
There's a lot a haters that don't want me to make it
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
So that you'll never forget me
Oh Ay Oh !

(Layzie Bone)

(Verse 2)
My reputation is solid gold
And my street cred is all polished y'all
Known as the little boss hog in the hood
Boy in my hood I'm a superstar
Niggas in the past try to hold a nigga down
But I put in my work and checked it checked it
Now these niggas respect it
Knowin I'm the wrong one they wanna mess with
From the gutter
With my brothers
Knowin on these ghetto streets they don't love us
Duckin' these undercovers
These muthafuckers doin everythin to try n bust us
But these suckas know they can't touch us
They envy deep in they hearts
Nigga if they ever try to rush us
Nigga they know we gon' rip 'em apart
Niggas go hard, from the start
Nigga this Nina-Ross is my bodyguard
Fuck with mine and I'll charge
Lil' crazy-ass nigga at large
Pullin cards on these lame niggas
I never let go of my heat
Stand up man on his feet
Lil' Lazyie Bone on the creep (nigga)

(Wish Bone)

(Verse 3)
What I got to do for you not to forget who brought
You that straight thug spit
Sped up a little bit with gangsta talk with that harmony
All over it
Hey!
Bone sang, 'n mixed in with that street talk
'N with no delay Eazy-E let us get our creep on
'N then he went home, but its all good
He left the right ones (bone) while still in th hood
Rest in peace (Eazy-E) like him when I die I hope
They remember me
Thats why I know I go loud n' reach you with these
Beats
Its not for nothin remember the thugs for the songs
That we sung
N makin it through that struggle, that struggle
It ain't easy believe me, can't breathe n believe it
Still goin our hustle game strong, I do it so
They remember me
