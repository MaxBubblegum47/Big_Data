[Verse 1]
Looking in the mirror again and again
Wishing the reflection would tell me something
I, I can't get a hold of myself
I can't get outta this situation
Walking in a straight line, thinking about last time
This time, I said I would do this right
Said I would never break this promise
But now I'm back to counting on us

[Pre-Chorus]
We cannot be friends
Cannot pretend
That it makes sense
We cannot be friends
Cannot pretend
That it makes sense

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm in it
But I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
Damn, I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute

[Verse 2]
Locking all the doors to my house, I'm alone in my head
But I wish you were in my bed
Can't get a read on myself
Gotta change this situation
Something in the way that I felt when I woke up
Told me that I shouldn't give in, give up hope
Told me that I shouldn't fight what I felt
Told me that I should not let go 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
We cannot be friends
Cannot pretend
That it makes sense

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm in it
But I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
Damn, I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
'Cause now I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
And the rain keeps coming down along the ceiling
And I can hear it
But I can't feel it, oh

[Bridge]
Took me so long
To fall
Now I'm in it, now I'm in it

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm in it
And I've been trying to find my way back for a minute
And the rain keeps coming down along the ceiling
And I can hear it
But I can't feel it, oh
