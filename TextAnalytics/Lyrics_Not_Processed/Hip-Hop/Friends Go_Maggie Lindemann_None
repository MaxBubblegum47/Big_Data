[Intro]
(I'm all by myself, I'm all by myself)
Where did all my friends go?

[Verse 1]
I miss those late nights
Just you and I up in my bedroom 'til sunrise
Could spend the night talking to you
Even if I was the only one talking
They busted the door, they don't see you at all
That don't mean you ain't there
'Cause I know that you are, swear itâ€™s true
They said that I was the only one talking

[Pre-Chorus]
White jacket, white pills
Told me I would feel better
But now, you ain't here
Will I ever feel better?
'Cause if you're only in my head
I don't wanna get out of it

[Chorus]
I'm all by myself (All by myself)
Where did all my friends go?
I miss you like hell (Miss you like hell)
I know you'll be back, though
They think that I'm crazy
They took you away
Now I'm all by myself
Where did all my friends go?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Where did all my friends go?

[Verse 2]
Nobody gets me the way that you get me
They just keep on saying you're imaginary
Not true (That's not true)
I can't imagine my life without you

[Pre-Chorus]
White jacket, white pills
Told me I would feel better
But now, you ain't here
Will I ever feel better?
'Cause if you're only in my head
I don't wanna get out of it

[Chorus]
I'm all by myself (I'm all by myself)
Where did all my friends go?
I miss you like hell (I miss you like hell)
I know you'll be back, though (Come back, though)
They think that I'm crazy
They took you away
Now I'm all by myself
Where did all my friends go?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh (Oh, where did they go?)
Ooh (I'm all by myself, I'm all by myself)
Ooh, ooh (I'm all by myself, I'm all by myself)
Ooh (Ooh, I'm all by myself)

[Outro]
Where did all my friends go?
