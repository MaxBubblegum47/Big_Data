[Chorus]
Ayy, she that's my favorite one
She said this her favorite song
I know you know you want gone
Sing my songs
Write my wrongs
'Cause girl you the cutest
Fuck feeling useless
Girl you got my heart in this shit I hope you notice
Nothing like your ex and shit I hope you know this
It's almost to the top and shit I'm feeling chosen

[Verse 1]
I said I miss you I love you
I cannot trust you
I'm done too
I tell you come through I run too
I see your ex and you ran through
But it's ok
Spend the night on god
And girl you got my heart don't you break my trust

[Chorus]
Ayy, she that's my favorite one
She said this her favorite song
I know you know you want gone
Sing my songs
Write my wrongs
'Cause girl you the cutest
Fuck feeling useless
Girl you got my heart in this shit I hope you notice
Nothing like your ex and shit I hope you know this
It's almost to the top and shit I'm feeling chosen

[Verse 2]
You my number one baby ain't no number two
You held me down before this fame so I forever fuck with you
So I said I'ma lock you up
I'ma put my cuffs on you
And if they speaking on our name then I'm about the trouble too (Ayy)
Hold on little baby let's just go and go live it up ayy
I could be your shoulder for crying don't give it up ayy
Caught you at the school you the cutest I hit you up ayy
Yeah they gon' copy but they can't ever mimic us ayy

[Outro]
Ayy, she that's my favorite one
She said this her favorite song
I know you know you want gone
Sing my songs
Write my wrongs
Jay Pusha you crazy
