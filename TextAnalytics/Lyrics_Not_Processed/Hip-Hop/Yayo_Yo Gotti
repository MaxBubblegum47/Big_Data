[Chorus: Snootie Wild]
Aye, yayo, all I know is yayo
Every time she hit the block, that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco, and you niggas know so
Aye, yayo, all I know is yayo
Every time she hit the block, that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco, and you niggas know so
Aye, yayo, all I know is yayo
Every time she hit the block, that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco, and you niggas know so

[Verse 1: Snootie Wild]
Aye, yayo, yeah I just said yayo
Taste just like candy cane but whiter then that pure snow
And why you trying to play me and you know you selling wappo?
When you with the boss, then I got to say so
Aye, oh no, he hit licks like "oh no"
Counting all this mula paper, you can call it mucho
Cause I be rockin' all this paper, moving weight like macho
I be eatin' nacho, cheese, guapo
Aye, vato, holla at amigo
And he gon get them bricks and wrap them tighter than burritos
I let him know, I need it for the low and need it pronto
He gon ship them off, pew, torpedo

[Chorus: Snootie Wild]
Aye, yayo, all I know is yayo
Every time she hit the block, that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco, and you niggas know so
Aye, yayo, all I know is yayo
Every time she hit the block, that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco, and you niggas know so

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Yayo, all I know is yayo
Trap been doing good, I'm serving junkies out the peephole
Laws, oh no, serve you, that's a no-go
But since you niggas actors, I might shoot like some B-roll
I got killas on my payroll, no sleep, I'm on NoDoz
On my Paul Wall stuff, I'm tippin with that .44
Mr. Thousand Eight Grams, Mr. Prices They Too High For Me
I love all my young niggas, I know they'll die for me
Bust five for me, cocaine in my county
Kush truck that loud weed, I don't smoke, blow a pound for me
Yayo, car's white like mayo
Seat white like whip cream, rims look like marshmallows

[Chorus: Snootie Wild]
Aye, yayo, all I know is yayo
Every time she hit the block, that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco, and you niggas know so
Aye, yayo, all I know is yayo
Every time she hit the block, that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco, and you niggas know so
