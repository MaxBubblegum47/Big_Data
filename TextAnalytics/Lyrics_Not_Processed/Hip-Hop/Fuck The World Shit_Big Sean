[Intro: Big Sean]
(We got London on Da Track)
I make promises like I'm...
Champagne
Yeah, woah, ok

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Today, I woke up on some fuck the world shit
With the same dick that I fuck my girl with
Weight of the world, that's what I curl with
She call me big daddy for encouragement

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Ooh, ooh
Getting money, yeah I gotta be nigga
I built it from the ground up like it was pottery nigga
Like I was hopping the fence, I got my friends up at sixteen
Then I realized that a 9 to 5 was not for me nigga
Tryna get paid, bouta hundred fifty ways
The judge and jury was a hundred fifty C's deep
Now the fucking jury bout a hundred fifty K
I ain't slipped them bout a hundred fifty K

[Pre-Chorus: Rich Homie Quan, Big Sean]
Hundred fifty, hundred fifty, hundred fifty, hundred fifty
I done been to hundred fifty places
Hundred fifty, hundred fifty, hundred fifty
I done fucked hundred fifty different faces
I done count up about a hundred fifty different faces
I done fucked about a hundred fifty pretty faces
I done been to about a hundred fifty different places
I done did a hundred fifty different faces

[Chorus: Big Sean, Rich Homie Quan]
Today, I woke up on some fuck the world shit
(Fuck the world shit)
With the same dick that I fuck my girl with
(That I fucked my girl with)
I said today, I woke up on some fuck the world shit
(Fuck the world shit)
With the same dick that I fuck my girl with
(That I fucked my girl with)
I said today I woke up on some fuck the world shit
With the same dick that I fuck my girl with
I said today I woke up on some fuck the world shit
With the same dick that I fuck my girl with
Weight of the world, that's what I curl with
She call me big daddy for encouragement

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ooh, shit
I mean she gotta love us
Top floor, helicopter pad the only thing above us
She closed off like a locked door
Champagne, pop more
My bitch, not yours
Fast life, mach 4
This a billy, wasn't regal
A hundred plus fifty, equal

[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
A hundred fifty more
A hundred fifty shows
Got a hundred fifty hoes
Solitary diamonds, hundred fifties, one dead loc
A hundred fifty dreams, had a hundred fifty goals
Till I did every one of them
Pour it, yeah, one of him
A hundred fifty bitches, now I'm under them
A nigga wanna song with him
Bitch want a son with him
That's me, I'm talkin' 'bout, don't want none of them
I'm a top flight nigga like...
Fuck that pussy like
I don't usually
But I might put my vanilla wafer in your motherfuckin' pudding like
All night, riding
Baby, suck it, don't bite it
No assurance, gotta cover like crying
A hundred fifty nigga, how might you divide it
Well bitch I'm...

[Pre-Chorus: Rich Homie Quan, Big Sean]
Hundred fifty, hundred fifty, hundred fifty, hundred fifty
I done been to hundred fifty places
Hundred fifty, hundred fifty, hundred fifty
I done fucked hundred fifty different faces
I done count up about a hundred fifty different faces
I done fucked about a hundred fifty pretty faces
I done been to about a hundred fifty different places
I done did a hundred fifty different faces

[Chorus: Big Sean, Rich Homie Quan]
Today, I woke up on some fuck the world shit
(Fuck the world shit)
With the same dick that I fuck my girl with
(That I fucked my girl with)
I said "Today, I woke up on some fuck the world shit"
(Fuck the world shit)
With the same dick that I fuck my girl with
(That I fucked my girl with)
I said today I woke up on some fuck the world shit
With the same dick that I fuck my girl with
I said today I woke up on some fuck the world shit
With the same dick that I fuck my girl with
Weight of the world, that's what I curl with
She call me big daddy for encouragement

[Outro: Big Sean]
Getting paid, bouta hundred fifty ways
The jury used to be hundred fifty deep
Now the fucking jury out for a hundred fifty K
Hundred fifty West Avenue
I stay top floor, bout a hundred fifty floors
Got a hundred fifty, and got a hundred fifty more
