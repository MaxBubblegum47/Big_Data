[Intro: DDG]
Yeah
Woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Take a step back with that smoke
Actin' like somehow you grown
Bitch, you ain’t grown, bitch, you ain't grown
You fell in love with your vices
All that I showed you was kindness
Rather be on one than honest, honest, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Queen Naija]
Why you looking at me sideways?
Say you in a different head space
Why you rubbing me the wrong way?
It's a little too late, woah, woah, woah, hold up

[Chorus: Queen Naija & 
DDG
]
Right before you call me, hold up
Right before you text me, hold up
Right before you hit me, put the pause on it, hit the brake on it
Woah, woah, hold up
Right before you call me, hold up
Right before you text me, hold up
Right before you hit me, put the pause on it, hit the brake on it
Woah, woah, hold up
Ooh, ooh, ooh (
Yeah, hold up, hold up
)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (
Yeah
)

[Verse 1: Queen Naija]
Bet you wish you didn’t mess up (Bet you wish you didn't)
Come back when I'm on my come-up (Like I'm gonna let you hit it)
You ain't gonna hit this, oh-na-na
Oh na-na, oh na-na
Who do you think you are?
You're the same as you were when you walked out the door
It don't work anymore on me

[Verse 2: DDG]
I think it's really your pride
You not expressing what you feel inside
Girl, I don’t know what you’re trying to hide
You said that you loved me, that shit was a lie
You wanna show me that you're independent
You’re good on your own, okay baby, I get it
I'm stressing you out and that's not my intention
Your new nigga gon' have to wait ’til I'm finished (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Queen Naija]
Why you looking at me sideways?
Say you in a different head space
Why you rubbing me the wrong way?
It's a little too late, woah, woah, woah, hold up

[Chorus: Queen Naija]
Right before you call me, hold up
Right before you text me, hold up
Right before you hit me, put the pause on it, hit the brake on it
Woah, woah, hold up
Right before you call me, hold up
Right before you text me, hold up
Right before you hit me, put the pause on it, hit the brake on it
Woah, woah, hold up

[Verse 3: DDG]
You say you don't want me but I know you cappin'
This shit overlapping, it already happened
Break up for the moment, I know where it's going
A rip in our bond but we already sewing
We get back together, we rougher than ever
But we are still young and I know it get better
Ain't trying to be freaky but who make you wetter?
That thing make me stay home like I'm on a tether

[Outro: DDG]
Woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Take a step back with that smoke
Actin' like somehow you grown
Bitch, you ain't grown, bitch, you ain't grown
You fell in love with your vices
All that I showed you was kindness
Rather be on one than honest, honest, yeah
