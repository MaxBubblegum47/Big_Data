[Verse 1]
She wanna go far so I told a lil' mama go long (hut!)
You wonder why I'm here, I won't be back for long
I got to make moves, no sleep all week in my room
Got another song to write right now
That songs about you
You said he does it all wrong
I want to get you on one
Hit you in the soft spot
Make you sing "ah, ah, ah"
Like right before you walk in the club
I'mma set your body up, up, up
You set on me, I'm set on my team

[Chorus]
It's OVO right now
It's UTU right now
They can sleep right now
I'm stepping up right now
I been up four nights
That's only for now
I'm gon' do me, you can leave me alone
I don't care, that's how I feel right now, right now, right now
I'm living better in the city right now, right now, right now
So we gonna get hotter right now, right now, right now
I'm living better in the city right now, right now, right now

[Verse 2]
I want to go far but she told me a young nigga get lost
I'm focused on you, girl
Got your friends parked in the lot
Oh she forgot something,
 
her eyes telling me come to the car
Undress me, touch me how you want
But I'm here, feel my presence when I'm here
Keep it real around me when I'm here
Don't get lost 'round here
This new life is like a breath of fresh air
I worked my ass off so it's fair
She no fear around me
You know I can see

[Chorus]
It's OVO right now
It's UTU right now
They can sleep right now
I'm stepping up right now
I been up four nights
That's only for now
I'm gon' do me, y'can leave me alone
I don't care, that's how I feel right now, right now, right now
I'm living better in the city right now, right now, right now
So we gonna get hotter right now, right now, right now
I'm living better in the city right now, right now, right now

[Outro]
(Don't worry about me) I'll be better
(All my niggas) You don't have to call me
Girl, I'll be better, I'll be better
Guess how I feel right now, right now, right now?
Guess how I feel right now, right now, right now?
Guess how I feel right now, right now, right now?
(I don't need you to call)
(Don't need, don't you to call me)
(Need you to call)
(I don't need you, call)
