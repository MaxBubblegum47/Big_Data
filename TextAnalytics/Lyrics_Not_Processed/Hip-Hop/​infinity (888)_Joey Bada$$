[Intro: Joey Bada$$ & XXXTENTACION]
â€”ggas will be like "Yo, these niggas is wildin' right now
Like, these niggas is really wildin'", you know what I'm sayin'?
Like, we ain't playin' with y'all niggas, man, ya heard?
Sometimes you just gotta catch chlamydia on these niggas, G-shit
You know what I'm sayin'? Gonorrhea, all that shit
All of that shit
I catch all diseases in the world
So the world don't have no more diseases, you feel me?
G-shit
Yeah, yeah
(P. Soul on the track)

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
I'm as real as they come, they feel it, get numb
You think you got a little buzz, so now you can't get stung?
I keep a razor blade tucked on me, under my tongue
Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of the hardest ever (Yeah)
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas (Bang)
And bomb whatever, say we don't move calmly, never (No)
This for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort
No pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxin' these niggas extra
This the Pro of all Eras, he's back in your sector
So, might be best to protect your neck
Or profess your debt to the god, he might bless ya

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
Murder these flows like I murder these ho ass niggas
Where the fuck is your energy, bro?
Make your nigga deepthroat a Desert Eagle
If he try me like a ho, pussy boy, that's on my soul
Make my flow shapeshift, cold expression like a facelift
At the publix with like eight grips if you talkin' all that ape shit
I'm not talkin' YMBAPE shit, but I'm bangin' on my chest, bitch
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Travelin' through the infinity, uh
You not that nigga, pretend to be, uh
All that bullshit do not get to me, uh
I am a spirit, an entity, uh
You just wan suck up my energy, uh
I am the realest since Kennedy, uh
You pussy ass niggas fuckin' suck, you sound the same
I spit the pain, that's why these young niggas feel the same
They know I bang, I'll pull a fuckin' pistol out the Range and act insane

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Joey Bada$$]
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
So I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, so I don't feel the pain no more (Yeah)
I don't feel the pain (Ayy) no more (Ayy)
