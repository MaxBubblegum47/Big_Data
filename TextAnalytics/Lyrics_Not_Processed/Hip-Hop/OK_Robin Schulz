[Verse 1]
I really need you
I really need your love right now
I'm fading fast
Not gonna last
I'm really stupid
I'm burning up, I'm going down
I'm in it bad
Don't even ask

[Pre-Chorus]
When I found myself in the middle, in the middle, in the middle
Could you love me more, just a little, just a little
Overcomplicate when it's simple, when it's simple, when it's simple
Would you love me more, just a little

[Chorus]
So tell me now
When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
Oh hold me now
When every ship is going down
I don't fear nothing when I hear you say

[Post-Chorus]
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay

[Verse 2]
I'm really sorry
Sorry I dragged you into this
I overthink, that's all it is
The way you love me
The way you love me 'til the end
The way you love me
Oh yeah, it makes me king again

[Pre-Chorus]
When I found myself in the middle, in the middle, in the middle
Could you love me more, just a little, just a little
Overcomplicate when it's simple, when it's simple, when it's simple
Would you love me more, just a little

[Chorus]
So tell me now
When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
Oh hold me now
When every ship is going down
I don't fear nothing when I hear you say

[Post-Chorus]
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay

[Bridge]
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay

[Post-Chorus]
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay

[Outro]
When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
It's gonna be okay
When every ship is going down
I don't fear nothing when I hear you say
It's gonna be okay
