[Intro]
Shoot through your car door, shoutout to Cardo

[Chorus]
I got the plug straight from my mans and she was starstruck
Ten shows back to back, come to my concert
And then she pulled up, she pulled up, then I saw her
Oh my god, she's a monster
She’s a monster, my god, she's a monster
She's a monster, my god, she’s a monster
She's a monster, she's a monster
She's a monster, my god, she's a monster

[Verse]
I didn't wanna knock her down, but I did though
Ten phones so a bitch don't get my info
I am way too poppin', lil’ bitch, I’m popular
She wanna be my main, I said that's way too cutthroat
My clothes line a bitch if she gon’ fold for
I can't let her, but you see me in public
She tried to walk out the room wearin' my merch
I said, "Bitch, come back, that's my shirt"

[Chorus]
I got the plug straight from my mans and she was starstruck
Ten shows back to back, come to my concert
And then she pulled up, she pulled up, then I saw her
Oh my god, she’s a monster
She's a monster, my god, she's a monster
She's a monster, my god, she's a monster
She's a monster, she's a monster
She's a monster, my god, she's a monster
