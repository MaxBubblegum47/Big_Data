[Pre-Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Yeah, I'll hit a bitch, 'cause I got nothin' to lose (Pew, pew, yeah)
Bought it all cash, I got somethin' to prove
And I'm just fuckin' with 'em, I got nothin' to do
Runnin' through these checks like the ones on my shoes (Woo, woo, woo, woo)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
So don't get geeked up (Bitch), might get beat up (Ho)
Tell that ho I'm movin' in 'cause her lease up (Get the fuck out)
Don't get geeked up (Bitch), might get beat up (Ho)
Movin' how I wanna, with my feet up

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
Yeah, my nails pink, but my hunnids blue (Hunnids blue)
Runnin' in these threes to these W's (Runnin', bitch)
And I might let you chill if I fuck with you
I don't wanna meet your mama, I ain't cuffin' you
Sixty a show (Sixty a show), look at this dough, look at this
Back of the Ghost, that's how I roll, I'm on some whole other shit
Diamonds colored like a Rubik's cube
My name Bhad Bhabie, bitch, who is you?

[Pre-Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Yeah, I'll hit a bitch, 'cause I got nothin' to lose (Pew, pew, yeah)
Bought it all cash, I got somethin' to prove (Somethin' to prove)
And I'm just fuckin' with 'em, I got nothin' to do
Runnin' through these checks like the ones on my shoes (Woo, woo, woo, woo)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
So don't get geeked up (Bitch), might get beat up (Ho)
Tell that ho I'm movin' in 'cause her lease up (Get the fuck out)
Don't get geeked up (Bitch), might get beat up (Ho)
Movin' how I wanna, with my feet up (Woo, woo, woo, woo)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'll one night ya (Night)
I might taste it if I like it, I won't wife ya (Wife)
Pull up Viper (Viper)
All my jewelry the right one (Right)
Ballin', I go Mike Jordan (Jordan)
Get head while I'm recordin' ('Cordin')
On FaceTime, won't record me ('Cord me)
Sixty for a show, I'm important
All my spots got glass windows (Yeah)
Still got snow like December
She want snow, no December
I don't go slow, go deep in her
Runnin' through checks, they keep appearin'
I don't get scared, I'm God-fearin'
New G-Wagen, I barely steer it
Paid all cash, I don't do leases

[Bridge: Bhad Bhabie & 
Lil Baby
]
Yeah, I'll hit a bitch
Leases
 (Pew, pew, yeah)
Bought it all cash
(
Motherfuckin' ballin'
)
And I'm just fuckin' with 'em
(
Just fuckin' with 'em
)
Runnin' through these checks like the ones on my shoes

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
So don't get geeked up (Bitch), might get beat up (Ho)
Tell that ho I'm movin' in 'cause her lease up (Get the fuck out)
Don't get geeked up (Bitch), might get beat up (Ho)
Movin' how I wanna, with my feet up
