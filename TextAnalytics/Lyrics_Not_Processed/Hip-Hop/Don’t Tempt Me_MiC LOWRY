[Intro]
Baby, I wanna say that it's fine, but
Baby, I wanna say that it's fine, but, it's fine, but

[Verse 1]
Uber's outside, girl, we gotta go
It's getting kinda cold, don't forget your coat
Baby, leave your friends, they ain't gotta know
Gotta know where we gon', where we gon' go
Quit fucking with them dudes, they just full of shit
Why you wasting time with the foolishness?
If you wanna leave and get intimate
Into it when we get, when we get home

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't tell me you can't cancel your plans
I'll cook you eggs in the morning
If that's not enough, girl, what do you want?
And I'll get it for ya

[Chorus]
Girl, come over here, chill with me
And drink all of my Hennessy
Don't tempt me, baby, don't tempt me
We can lay here on this couch
We'll fuck 'til the sun come back out
Don't tempt me, baby, don't tempt me

[Post-Chorus]
Don't tempt me now, don't tempt me, yeah
Baby, don't tempt me
Don't tempt me now, don't tempt me, yeah
Baby, don't tempt me

[Verse 2]
We'll still be drunk when the morning comes
Or we can get high off another one
Fuck one more time 'fore we gotta run
Gotta run, that was fun, I'll hit your phone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So tell me what's your plans on a Saturday?
'Cause I don't really have any anyway
Wanna help me kill this bottle of Chardonnay?
Tell me, babe, what do you say?

[Chorus]
Girl, come over here, chill with me
And drink all of my Hennessy
Don't tempt me, baby, don't tempt me
We can lay here on this couch
We'll fuck 'til the sun come back out
Don't tempt me, baby, don't tempt me

[Post-Chorus]
Don't tempt me now, don't tempt me, yeah
Baby, don't tempt me
Don't tempt me now, don't tempt me, yeah
Baby, don't tempt me

[Bridge]
Don't tell me you can't cancel your plans
Girl, I'll cook you eggs in the morning, whoa
If that's not enough, what else do you want?
And I'll get it for ya, I'll get it for ya
Baby, don't tempt me, baby

[Chorus]
Girl, come over here, chill with me
And drink all of my Hennessy
Don't tempt me, baby, don't tempt me
We can lay here on this couch
We'll fuck 'til the sun come back out
Don't tempt me, baby, don't tempt me
(Said, baby, don't tempt me)
Girl, come over here, chill with me
And drink all of my Hennessy
Don't tempt me, baby, don't tempt me
We can lay here on this couch
We'll fuck 'til the sun come back out
Don't tempt me, baby, don't tempt me

[Post-Chorus]
Don't tempt me now, don't tempt me, yeah
Baby, don't tempt me
Don't tempt me now, don't tempt me, yeah
Baby, don't tempt me
Don't tempt me now, don't tempt me, yeah
Baby, don't tempt me
Don't tempt me now, don't tempt me, yeah
Baby, don't tempt me
Oh, I love that you're wrong, baby, don't tempt me
