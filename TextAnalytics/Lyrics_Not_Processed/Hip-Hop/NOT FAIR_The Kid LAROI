[Intro: Corbin]
I can't cum unless you kiss me
I don't know her but she saying that she miss me
Rolling with that 450
Why they wanna send me under, fucking six feet?
I cope how they want, yeah I keep the safe off
Never out in public 'cause they talk
Got a taste and got shell-shocked
Drive me to Hell in a drop-top

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
Uh, drive me to Hell in a drop-top
I need you to save me 'fore I fuck up and go too far
I hate that you blame me for the things that I cannot control
I'm out here tryna make it work for us, it's too much
On my plate, got it all at stake
Say you hate me now, but you're at my place
Tell me lies, tell me that it's all okay
Tell me why you love me, even if it's fake

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Corbin]
It's not fair
No matter what, I'm still gon' be here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Crash and burn, Princess Diana
Better off, better off dead
You don't wanna come around here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Don't wanna be myself, I'm too scared
Yeah-yeah, I'm too scared

[Verse 2: Corbin]
Even if it isn't real, I wanna hear it (Oh, Oh)
Pour my heart out on the floor and now it's leaking (Oh, Oh)
Spent two-thousand on an F and N, don't make me squeeze it
I don't care if it was all pretend, I wanna feel it

[Verse 3: The Kid LAROI]
M.O.B. 'cause if I lose it all, you leavin'
Bitch, you don't love me, that's a lie, I don't believe it (Nah, nah)
Money make these bitches go insane, yeah, I done seen it (Oh, no)
I don't wanna hear it anymore if you don't mean it
(I don't want, I don't want) Don't wanna fall too deep
Trust issues, it's too hard to give you all of me
Love isn't what you see and what you want it to be
I want you, but I just can't give you all of me

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & Corbin]
It's not fair
No matter what, I'm still gon' be here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Crash and burn, Princess Diana
Better off, better off dead
You don't wanna come around here
It's hard for me to show you I care
Don't wanna be myself, I'm too scared
Yeah-yeah, I'm too scared
