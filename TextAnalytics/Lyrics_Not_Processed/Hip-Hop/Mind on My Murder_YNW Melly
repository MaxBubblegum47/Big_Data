[Intro]
I thank God for everything
Mind on my murder (Mind on my murder)
Young Nigga World, bitch
Mind on my murder, murder
"Murder on My Mind," part two, hey

[Verse 1]
Sky is getting red, body getting cold
Losing hella blood, Lord, please save my soul
If I have to die, don't know where I'll go
I don't want to die, I'm only 10 years old, oh
My mama cried
Yellow tape around my body, it's a homicide
And he told me it was accidental, by surprise
Ambulances everywhere and I just pray that I survive

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, it's a homicide, oh, a homicide
He just shot me and I dropped down to the floor
He said I caught him by surprise, I caught him by surprise
He was shell-shocked and he claimed he didn't know
I grabbed his hand 'cause I was terrified, said I was scared to die
He just watched my blood spill out and die slow
I looked him right inside the eyes, he looked inside my eyes
Asked him would I survive? He shook his head no

[Chorus]
Mind on my murder, yeah, murder, huh, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, yeah, murder, ayy, murder, hey
Mind on my murder, yeah, murder, hey, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, hey, mind on my murder

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around my body, it's a homicide
Never thought my day one friend would be the one to take my life
And he ain't even shoot me once, this nigga shot me twice
And I dropped down to the floor and I had teardrops in my eyes
Never thought a home invasion would've costed me my life
All I wanted was a mouth full of golds and my neck and wrist with ice
But now I just got murdered while I go in paradise
Just sing this chorus with me twice

[Chorus]
Mind on my murder, hey, murder, hey, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, hey, murder, hey, murder, hey
Mind on my murder, hey, murder, hey, murder, hey
Mind on my murder, hey, mind on my murder

[Verse 3]
Fuck with it then and your life will get ended
Fuck do you know about Melly the Menace?
Glock-26 and that bitch is extended
Glock-27, bitch, I'm really with it
Catch that fuck nigga, hit him with the semi
You know my young niggas really ain't friendly
Bite like tarantula, flip like a spatula
Suck on that bitch, I want blood like I'm Dracula
Whoa-whoa, suck on it slow, fuck that lil' bitch on the floor
You know it's Melly the Menace, the clip is extended
You fuck with me, life will get ended
We go in your mouth like a dentist
We walk through the entrance
Bitch, give me the bag, run it up
Your bitches wanna have fun with us
She wanna tote on a gun with us
She smokin' dick, yeah that ho smokin' angel dust
Topic, yeah
Let a nigga get back on top, yeah
Pull up on a nigga with that Glock-ock, bitch
I don't give no fuck about shot, shit
I don't give no F-U-X about her
Pull up on a nigga, it's a fuckin' M-1
Free my nigga Trell, he just caught an M-1

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, it's a homicide, oh, a homicide
He just shot me and I dropped down to the floor
He said I caught him by surprise, I caught him by surprise
He was shell-shocked and he claimed he didn't know
I grabbed his hand 'cause I was terrified, said I was scared to die
He just watched my blood spill out and die slow
I looked him right inside the eyes, he looked inside my eyes
Asked him would I survive? He shook his head no

[Chorus]
Mind on my murder, murder, huh, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, ayy, murder, ayy, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, ayy, murder, ayy, murder, huh
Mind on my murder, hey, mind on my murder, yellow tape...
