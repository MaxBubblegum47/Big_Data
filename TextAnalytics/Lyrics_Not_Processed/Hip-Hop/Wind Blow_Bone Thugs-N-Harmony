[Intro: Layzie Bone + sample]
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
Ayo, we ain't always been accepted like this
Till a nigga got that Grammy ("Listen to the wind blow")
Open the do', nigga

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone + Krayzie Bone + Wish Bone + sample]
Bone Thugs got a story that's similar to Mike Jones, you can ask my homies
I remember back in the days when they didn't want me
Now, I blew up, they all on me, they smiles phony
It's hard to determine who really is wit'chu
These niggas is fake
They tryin to eat out of yo' plate and you can't get a break
Now how much can you take, for heaven's sakes
I can't wait, they got me listenin'
("Listen to the wind blow")
Sittin' back, blowin' on my indo
Rollin' with my middle finger hangin' out the window, let's roll
Get your motherfuckin' hand out my pocket
Now you wanna be a nigga friend, like we partners
Nigga, we was lookin' for a deal and you dodged us
Never did call us, what was yo' problem?
But now we ridin' by
("Listen to the wind blow")
Niggas tell the real from the fake when it comes from the streets
Live in peace like a beat, like a drum from the ghetto (Ghetto)
Give us our peace, won't let it go (Let it go)
Said we wouldn't make it, now we some of the greatest
Bumpin' through yo' trunks and yo' radio, radio!

[Chorus: Sample]
"And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)"

"And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)"

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone + Krayzie Bone + Wish Bone + sample]
Fo' true thugs from the Double-Glock
A nigga ready to rumble when the trouble knocks
Took one-way tickets straight off the block
We gon' make this pay, y'all niggas just watch
All eyes on me like my name was 'Pac
Fuckin hip-hop cop got a plastic Glock
I'm takin drastic shots 'til these bastards stop
When the casket drop, I'll be mashin out
In a brand new drop-top Fire, nigga
Listenin' to the wind
("Listen to the wind blow")
Killin a nigga with an automatic weapon
When they step up they get hit up with a AK-47
Everybody's tryin to get a nigga with a blessin
They better not mess with mine cause I'm tellin
All you niggas from the beginnin, that it ain't no pretendin
Conversate you gon' get in
You better listen, listen, listen
("Listen to the wind blow")
If you get it take it to the fullest inch for inch just do it, do it
Grab the game do it to it, to it
Chasin change but still, hood - live it or love it
Diamonds in the rough, don't come by to my hood, hood, hood

[Chorus: Sample]
"And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)"

"And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)"

[Bridge: Krayzie Bone]
Murderous ways (murder dem, murder dem, all)
In ev-ery way (murder dem, murder dem, all)
In the early days (murder dem, murder dem, all)
Controversial (murder dem, murder dem, all)

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone + Layzie Bone + sample]
See me flow like the wind blow, never see me 'cause I get ghost
So a nigga never get close, I go fast or slow, no matter the tempo
Murder the instrumental, murder the rhythm
I run to the rhythm of murda, it's murda
This lyrical venom I serve up gon' kill 'em at minimal murder
Nigga, burn somethin' (Some'n), stick with Granddaddy, stack cash
Nigga, you better learn some'n (Some'n), we got the hood hot locked
Even got the 'burbs bumpin'—everybody tryin' to get in
Don't nobody wanna be left in the wind (Nope, nope, nope, nope)
Uh-uh, nigga better not try to miss the boat
The early bird get the worm, took the game by the throat
And squeezed, 'til the motherfucker broke
Believe, it's murder we wrote
It's dope that we serve from the curb to the booth
These niggas gon' feel it cause we spit the truth
Ain't never no fakin, that Grammy the proof
Haters just hatin we do what we do ("And if—")
Let 'em talk 'til they blue in the face
Only because we blew up in they face
If Bone was hurtin', if that was the case
I'd probably go loco and catch me a case
Nigga, just move, and give me some space
When I let the wind blow in my face
Nigga don't quit till I finish the race
Number one in the place, better make no mistakes

[Chorus: Sample]
"And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)"

"And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)"

[Outro: Krayzie Bone]
And now we ridin' by
And now we ridin' by
Now we ridin' by
Now we ridin' by
