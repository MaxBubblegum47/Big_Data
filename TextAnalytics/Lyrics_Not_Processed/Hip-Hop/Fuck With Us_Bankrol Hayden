[Intro]
Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy, that probably Tago
Pipe that shit up TNT
You know you can't fuck with us, hoe
You can't fuck with us, ha, ayy
Look

[Chorus]
You know you can't fuck with us
Know what's up with us
Hoe can't get no love from us
Boy you talk too much, got too much on my mind (Mind)
Wastin' all my time (Time)
Get up on my line
'Cause you know you can't fuck with us
You know you can't fuck with us
Know what's up with us
Hoe can't get no love from us
Boy you talk too much, got too much on my mind (Mind)
Wastin' all my time (Time)
Get up on my line
'Cause you know you can't fuck with us

[Verse 1]
You know I can't fuck with them
Opps I cannot fuck with them
Claim they real, they can't pretend
Load 2K, can't play with him
Bankrol, you can't play with him
Bankrol, yeah they hate on him
Ain't shit you could say to me
'Cause life just ain't the same to me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we be on the roads, sellin' shows, gettin' money now
Designer my clothes, all these hoes wanna love me now
I could never fold on my bros 'cause they hold it down
First they didn't know, who I was called, now they know it now

[Chorus]
You know you can't fuck with us
Know what's up with us
Hoe can't get no love from us
Boy you talk too much, got too much on my mind (Mind)
Wastin' all my time (Time)
Get up on my line
'Cause you know you can't fuck with us
You know you can't fuck with us
Know what's up with us
Hoe can't get no love from us
Boy you talk too much, got too much on my mind (Mind)
Wastin' all my time (Time)
Get up on my line
'Cause you know you can't fuck with us

[Verse 2]
Shawty sayin' I'm an asshole
No titties but that ass though
She in love with the cash flow
Bankrol with the Afro
I've been all up in my bag bro
Yeah, I put my city on the map, dawg
Fell in love with a bad hoe
But I couldn't walk for a bad hoe
Send me a text, I don't know what she said
Didn't reply bet I left it on read
Oh that's your girl, why she all on my bed?
Got played by a bitch but never again, yeah
Got played by a bitch but never again, yeah
Never again

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we be on the roads, sellin' shows, gettin' money now
Designer my clothes, all these hoes wanna love me now
I could never fold on my bros 'cause they hold it down
First they didn't know, who I was called, now they know it now

[Chorus]
You know you can't fuck with us
Know what's up with us
Hoe can't get no love from us
Boy you talk too much, got too much on my mind (Mind)
Wastin' all my time (Time)
Get up on my line
'Cause you know you can't fuck with us
You know you can't fuck with us
Know what's up with us
Hoe can't get no love from us
Boy you talk too much, got too much on my mind (Mind)
Wastin' all my time (Time)
Get up on my line
'Cause you know you can't fuck with us
