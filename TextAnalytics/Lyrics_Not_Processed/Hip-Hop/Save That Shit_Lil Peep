[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

[Refrain]
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)

[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (Make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?
(Do I make you scared?)

[Bridge]
Down another lonely road, I go
Just another lonely road to home
I just wanna know, I just gotta know
Do you wanna glo? Baby, we could glo

[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

[Outro]
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?
Nothin' like them other mothafuckas'
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
