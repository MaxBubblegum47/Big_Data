[Intro]
'Cause I know you will (Ayy)
'Cause I know you will
Ayy, huh

[Chorus]
Like I won't do no hatin' 'cause I know you will
Two hoes with me, Lou Will
Big bankroll, all new bills
'Bout to buy a brib, cost me two mill'
'Bou to get you dropped, that don't cost nothin'
Cough syrup in my pop, still don't cough nothin'
Huh, if it ain't no weight I ain't lost nothin'
Huh, I don't do no waitin’, bitch I'm boss bummin'

[Verse]
Huh, fuck is wrong with dawg? He must be off somethin'
Huh, can't tell what he on but bet I off somethin'
Huh, like soon as he get started bet I stop it
Huh, we got sticks in the party, playin' hockey
Huh, we got pills in the party, Bill Cosby
Huh, bad bitches in the trap hotel lobby
Huh, do some drugs then I dance, Whitney, Bobby
Huh, Beyoncé with this can, get eem' bodied
Ayy, ring the alarm on 'em, we gon bear arms on 'em
Brand new AR's on 'em, drank out the farm on 'em
Chops out the car on 'em, my chops ain't borrowed 'em
Hot shots in all of 'em, few niggas, can't call on 'em
I ain't relied on 'em
They lucky I just don’t wake up and slide on 'em
No apologies, I done made up my mind on 'em
Another rose gold chain on my neck built to shine on 'em
Unk got them thangs on the plane, just touched down on 'em
We gone keep that smile on us, just to keep that frown on 'em
Might knock some pounds off you, keep talkin' down on us
Sip me some Actavis, relax and lounge on 'em
Put them hoes to work, ayy, get me off some Percs, ayy
I got that cheese on IG, nigga see me, be hurt, ayy
She gon get the dick, she flirt, 
we be slurpin' on 'em first
With that shit from the hood all the way to the burbs
With that molly in my lemonade, dope all in the 'frigerator
FNs on my renegade, cocaine on my Carti shades
Xanny in my party days, hittin' hoes from far away
Just to give they heart away, like Ro we gon' start today
I was shootin' at the park today, shit 'bout to get dark today
Niggas get to talkin', be so hard for me to walk away
40's sparkin', be hard for police to put the chalk away
Got a nigga gone, feelin' good, we givin' dog away, huh

[Chorus]
Like I won't do no hatin' 'cause I know you will
Two hoes with me, Lou Will
Big bankroll, all new bills
'Bout to buy a brib, cost me two mill
'Bout to get you dropped, that don't cost nothin'
Cough syrup in my pop, still don't cough nothin'
If it ain't no weight, I ain't lost nothin'
Huh, I don't do no waitin', bitch I’m boss bummin' (Huh)
