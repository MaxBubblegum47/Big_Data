[Verse 1]
All we need is a July hot Saturday night
A couple cans all cool and the needle on full and a countryside
Yeah, a hot little playlist, of your favorite songs
When I get you climbing up in the cab of this truck
Yeah you know it's on, know it's on

[Chorus]
Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night

[Verse 2]
So give me that aw yeah, and take me there look
I'm a sucker for your kiss, wanna steal 'em from your lips baby, like a truck
Foot heavy on the floorboard, everywhere we go
I'm talking once in a lifetime, blowing your mind
Burning down these back roads

[Chorus]
Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
So give me that aw yeah, and I'll give you that all night
Girl, give me that let's go, and I'll give you that good good time

[Chorus]
Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night

[Outro]
Yeah, a once in a lifetime night
Ooh girl, looking down the ride of one hell of a night
I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
