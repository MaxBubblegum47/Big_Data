[Chorus]
Super charged in this RT, Percs got me activated (Activated)
Since a jit played wit' computers, I was educated
Now I take a log and wipe it all and leave 'em devastated (And leave 'em devastated)
X's to the face lil' bitch, I'm elevated (I'm elevated)
Niggas thinkin' that they cool, we get 'em situated (We get 'em situated)
KD in a wood and I ain't passin', I think I'ma face it (I'ma face it)
Lil Eazzyy coming for thе impact, I hope that they can take it (I'm comin' in)
And if you fuckin' wit' that bitch, that bond I'm finna brеak it (I'm finna break it)

[Verse 1]
Feelin' rich might tote a Glock inside my fanny pack
Niggas be allergic to the money, ain't explainin' that
I put that guap on top yo head and now you off the map
And I been runnin' laps straight to that paper while I tote the MAC
Put the guys up on my back, yeah, I carry my team
Lately I been fightin' wit' my conscience so I sippin' lean
Can't see through my Cartiers so they say that I'm mean
Twin say I be tweakin' wit these niggas when I'm off the bean
I think these BBs in my belt they boost my self esteem
I'm only 18 but I guala like I'm Charlie Sheen
Sticks and Glocks they filled wit' hollows and they fuckin' sting
Bumblebee the scat when I fly past, I make sure that I'm seen

[Verse 2]
How you call yourself a scammer? You ain't got no numbs
We used to hide up in the trap, the gang we on the run
I put yo brudda in my 'Wood and now he in my lungs
I been chasing paper while you broke niggas been chasin' crumbs
He gave me the log, I got no choice, I gotta wipe it all
I been poppin' Perkies, I'm with Dan, I hope I do not fall
Stackin' chips, I cannot stop until I stack it tall
I can't walk outside, I need 'bout five when I walk in the mall
That ain't five racks, bitch, you know that's 50
I bought a new Glizzy and you know it hold a titty
And if this lil' bitch jam then you know I'ma cop a Smitty
I been riding wit' my bruddas and you know we serve the city, ayy

[Outro]
Ayy, that bond I'm finna break it
Ridin' in the scatty, trick, I know you cannot trace it
Ayy, your weed I fuckin' laced it
Ridin' in the scatty...
