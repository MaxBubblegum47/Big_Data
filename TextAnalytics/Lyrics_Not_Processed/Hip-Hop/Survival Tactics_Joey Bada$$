[Intro]
It's either them or you
It's sort of like survival, you know
Survival of the fittest, you know
You do what you do to stay alive

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Niggas don't want war—I'm a martian, with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right; your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite; I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got 'em niggas P-E-Nuts—like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they light year, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit time to inaugurate
My P.E.-conglomerates 'bout to P-E-E on any wanna-B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame-spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be Simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of Theodora, my heart go
"Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom-boom"
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that 'K
Like every day in every way, and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is, "Pray"
'Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and got you slippin'
Another victim, don't know what's hit them—through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best—I'm like, "You're so right"
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

[Interlude: Joey BadA$$ & Capital STEEZ]
Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass-corrupt politician on Wall Street
P.E., Public Enemy, Assassinate us—bitch
Fuck that, fuck everything, son
Fuck government, fuck—listenin' and shit
You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
It's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Start spitting fire 'cause my motherfuckin' lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, I been the flyest with it
Wouldn't mind a feign of interest for your finest interest
They say hard work pays off
Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
'Cause P.E.'s about to take off
With protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin', "Fuck censorship!"
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed
'Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan
And Pokémon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzi's 'cause its given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man’s tryna disrespect it
Send a message and it's over in a millisecond—nigga
