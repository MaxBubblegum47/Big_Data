Yeah it's the remix..
We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always
And ready to bring the war if you hate, if you hate
We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always
And ready to bring the war if you hate..

[Bizzy]
Comin' through the door with my militia
Why do they bring big niggas, fuck y'all with a gang of bodyguards
My niggas is stone cold killas, peelas, dippin' out the limos
And bitch, y'all just maintain
Givin' my babies all of my money
But my diamonds steady be shinin', my-gang you know me
Homies got mo' love, and the Biz follow all of my senses
Pump my fist to "Mo Thug"
Gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders, Jesus
Sent me his roll and loco soul but load a revolver
Hold up, now, buck 'em all to Hell, cause I'm show enough
And I seen that the bullet holes was too much, no luck
Ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out
The surgeons say that your body cannot be sewed up
Hold up, and wait a minute
It's time for Bone Thugs
Cause y'all think that you can really hate, nigga

[Krayzie]
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
(Would you look into my eyes)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
(Could you tell me what you see)

What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit
And call his shit original, what's worse
Tellin' people you made the style
We put down three fuckin years ago
And that's just like a nigga wanna take all the credit
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya
And don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy
And I don't wanna say a nigga name and all that
But a y'all fin to get stomped, whoof let 'em loose
And they heard the news, ya run up, ya could get dead, oh
Uh-huh, hey, we murder motherfuckers in a deadly way
Fully automatic when I let 'em lay, aw shit get down "Leathaface"
Fuck 'em all if I can't get my respect
Come on, now, put them to rest
What a bloody, bloody mess, but never the less, we won't stress
I figured this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me
It's all in your mind, but in time
You'll find we as real as we speak (speak, speak...)

[Krayzie]
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
(Would you look into my eyes)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
(Could you tell me what you see)

[Layzie]
All I see is a soldier, pistol 'n holster, givin' you the most
I toast to them thugs, nigga nothin' but the love of bud
That we brought to the table, and a nigga wanna test
Catch slugs, put 'em in the mud, harmony smooth with the thug shit
Mo murda to the fools that clone
Five niggas loc'd out with the roughness, nigga
And it's war when you craft these Bones, we can get it on
And I'm referrin' to all a y'all bitches
Y'all know who y'all when y'all tried that
Rollin' with the E since ninety-three, shuttin' shit down
In the industry, nigga, can you bite that
I know y'all niggas wanna roll with pros
And make friend of foes, but we chosen
God done blessed us with his potion, pure devotion, freely spoken
Baby...Niggas can't see us never, stay together
My click to clever, ridin' through days of the stormy weather
Remember: eternal, it means forever lastin'
"#1 Assassin" blastin', bashin' on all you niggas
Is what I'm doin', cause all of the heavens gonna be rulin' trues
When he come, we won't be losin', provin' 'em wrong

[Krayzie]
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
(Would you look into my eyes)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
(Could you tell me what you see)

[Wish]
I see five killa realer niggas ready, roll wherever I go
True to pull the trigger, smother a nigga, put 'em in a river
We the killas, and that's for sure, niggas out there clownin mine
You can't rhyme, the style you got is all mine
And when I see you bitch, I'm goin' in your pockets double time
And it's like that, you don't want that
Come and get some pap, pap
Wanna sound like- Wanna be like- uh, nigga we can't have that
Why a nigga wanna bite the Bone shit, platinum raps
Nigga bet the bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin'
Tryin' to make somethin' outta nothin', fuck it let's peel caps
Buck 'em all down, put 'em in check, fuck 'em up with the 44 mag
I'm glad, cause when you're fuckin' with Bone
We sendin' 'em home in a bodybag
Now look into my eyes, bet you see a realer killa thug
Puttin' it down with harmony, harmony

[Krayzie]
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
(Would you look into my eyes)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
(Could you tell me what you see) (*2x*)
