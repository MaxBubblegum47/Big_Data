[Verse 1: Flesh N Bone]
We in the last foul days of these trials and tribulations
And I'm waiting for the Lord,oh please don't leave me forsaken
Caught up in the doom,prepare for Satan
So we facing a situation,while I'm drunk I'm staring
Heavily sedating,wonder will I make it to the pearly gates,nigga?
Or will I burn off in that lake now?
When you feelin the earthquake shaking the dead awake
How many waited too late? it's over now
You niggas had a lack of faith so life ain't straight, if you incapable
Having a little trouble,unable to feel ya soul
Better bleed the blood of Jesus
Watch how the majesty control it
Don't let it go,slow down hold on
Now can I get a witness shout Hallelujah, Amen
I'm feeling the Holy Ghost make ya moves soothe ya
Smooth, I'm able to free ya mind in the way that my God designed, when the world drop dimes
This world, you'll find there's no other like my kind

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
If the world should end today
Fully automatic gunning through it
Gunning thangs, Redrum when strumming pain
Mo murda, I heard 'em holla holla, clock dollars
Swallow me baby cause we balling hollow point tips to the CI
Enemies keep falling, and I'm off embalming fluid
Making me nauseous, cautious these niggas is flossing
Nina Ross tossed out on Slawson
It's for the auction rapper pop a copper got gospel on 'em
Who wanna magnum, who wanna tag 'em
Bag 'em up  no problem, baby (bitch)
Smoked out in high school
Sleeping at friends cribs selling chicken
Gotta get paid we in the kitchen
Cooking up yay away we go,go wit em
Whole lotta muthafuckin guns
Another fifth took one hood shot she split up
Don't nobody get up,or everyone get lit up & hit up so hard it make ya sit up sit up

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Make me push this panic button nigga
We movin' like the Panthers in the sixties
Khaki suited booted my thugs recruited
You with me nigga you wit me
Militant-minded, perfect timing it
Always on the incline and shit
Nigga that's down for the grind and shit
Keepin' real niggas rewinding this
Deep in the ghetto in the streets of Cleveland
We call it thieving mind deceiving
Hear the reasons for hustling season
Bottom line money is power
And the power mean muscle
Money and guns stacked up to the ceiling
Nigga get down for his hustle his hustle hustle
Now nigga now what you gon' do when they come for you
Well I'ma tell you right now what we gon' do
Scream M-O-G and start blasting
Nigga never did like them boys in blue
No regards for authorities
Wanna dump a nigga up with the thorazine
Oh you invited to the bloody-ass whore scene
Know what I mean you betta get with the team
Cause this is the soldiers ready for war nigga
We from way down under nigga been waiting for the day
To let off these rounds it's thunder, it's thunder
Got my mind made up, and if niggas straight balling up outta control
Just as those hoes nigga rose
On a mission tryna get that dough
Separated mine through prose
Open and close just like a case
Place to place you're feeling you're safe
HB all up in my face
And it just ain't safe it just ain't safe safe
I'm knowing they want me to catch it in war
Boy, boy I seek and destroy any nigga that throw the decoy
See me I'm stacked and ripping shit
Taking off my shirt and breaking them sweats
Tattoos all over my body, seven on the stomach
Skull on my chest, nine millimetre in my pocket
Ready to buck on the crowd
As long as that one little nigga
Sagging and bragging and talking loud
Talking about he bout it, bout it
Nigga I got yo whole clique
Real niggas don't run they mouth
Real niggas make moves and get rich

[Verse 4: Flesh N Bone]
Rollin in an expedition
Thinking of a proposition
Settle my composition
Feeling relentless,fucking up ya condition
Mo murda competition
How many niggas on the frontline
Ready for whateva my nigga,with your tech nine
Nigga disrespect mine
I win,you lose the draw,full metal rip through thine spine
If you wanna listen to what I say
Hey gotta pay ya tuition
This ain't no free exploit of an exhibit
Cause, my niggas, too exquisite
I'm so armageddon, this is my Smith & Wesson
Here's a nice slug for you
And my nitrogen glyc bomb
Can land on them,nuke them all
Now watch when they all come stormin'
So one by one hit 'em up,they fall
Let off with a little frustration,bust my gun
Bullets hum

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Come Murder One, Come Murder One
Murder them all
