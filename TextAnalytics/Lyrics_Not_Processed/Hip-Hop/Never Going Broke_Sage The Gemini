[Verse 1: IamSu]
Ape shit, I go ape shit on every beat
Took my ass on the road, sold out every seat
Hip-Hop is diabetic, these niggas is very sweet
Need a steel casket if you finna bury me
Cause I'm hard, H A R to the D
I'm the God listen to the Lord when he speak
Young Su, no not for super unique
But a double suplex is what I do to a beat

[Hook: P-Lo & Kool John]
They hatin' on me can't stop
I'ma take it, take it to the top
I'ma take it, take it to the top
I'ma take it, take it to the top (Yeah now I'm)
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke (Now I'm)
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke
Oh, woah, oh-oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh, woah, oh-oh (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Kool John]
Hey mama come through to dada
Finna throw a little party
Come sip this vodka
Bring some friends for my friends, we can all be partners
We be shootin' for the stars, we them pop starters
Been real since I been sippin' Simliac
Spending crack on every bitch where I'm finna snap
I'm WalMart to you mini-marts
All you niggas buncha jokes like Kevin Hart
I payed my dues now it's time to pay attention
When you scratchin' through the illest, Kool John should be mentioned
I charge a lot for investin' in a lot of mad rappers
Put my niggas to the top I'ma hear me laughin'

[Hook: P-Lo]
They hatin' on me can't stop
I'ma take it, take it to the top
I'ma take it, take it to the top
I'ma take it, take it to the top (Yeah now I'm)
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke (Now I'm)
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke
Oh, woah, oh-oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh

[Verse 3: Jay Ant]
Young nigga I ain't never goin' broke (No)
I'ma ball 'til the day croak (Oh)
If my name in your mouth, I hope you choke
We 'bout action like a G.I. Joe
Gotta be afloat (Huh)
It's real big nigga beyond dope (Huh)
Young nigga gotta be on dope (Huh)
To ever think that we goin' broke

[Verse 4: Skipper]
Fuck Puerto Rican mamis, let her call me papi
Took her to the top floor, meet her in the lobby
Like it on the top though
Ride it like Ducati
Zoom, zoom, zoom red lights couldn't stop me
Money automatic, know I gotta have it
Comin' off the rich though, know that I'm a savage
Know that it's the gang ho, rep it to the casket
Never going broke if I want it I can have it
When I'm in the building, they be going crazy
Give her that D, she wanna have babies
Put me on the beat, you know I'm gon' save it
HBK yea you know it I'm bangin'

[Hook: P-Lo]
They hatin' on me can't stop
I'ma take it, take it to the top
I'ma take it, take it to the top
I'ma take it, take it to the top (Yeah now I'm)
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke (Now I'm)
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke
Never goin' broke, never goin' broke
Oh, woah, oh-oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh
