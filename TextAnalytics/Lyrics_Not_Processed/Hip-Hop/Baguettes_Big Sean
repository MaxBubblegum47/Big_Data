[Intro: Young Thug]
Please don't leave me, no
Mufasa, she sexy lady
(Wheezy Beats)
Ooh, rastafari
Ooh, wait

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
We made love inside the booth yesterday and I still smell it
Oh yeah, I still smell it
I want my twins in that Bentley, eat it like peanut butter and jelly
I got that Leer jet, slow it down with side chicks, hey

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Lotta baguettes on me
Lotta baguettes on me
Lotta baguettes on me
Got a lotta baguettes on me
Lotta baguettes on me
Lotta baguettes on me
Got a lotta baguettes on me
Damn, I got a lotta baguettes on me

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Lotta blue checks on me, stretch V-neck on me
Not a fan of Nike, nah, but I got a lotta blue checks on me
And I got a hoe, if you don't know, and I'm 'bout to put her on fleek
Put that lil' bitch in a foreign, praying I take her off E
Bitches get- (Bitches get what?)
Bitches get- (Bitches get what?)
Bitches get bounced around, skeet off in a Maserati
Bitch, you better not tell nobody
They peepin' my song, they bitin'
Long way from [?], now I'm in a Maybach grindin' like space
Playin' 'round with dog, yeah, you might get Peter rolled
I got brothers behind the walls and they ready to eat your nose
All these guns signing off, 23 shots like new [?]
Show me these diamonds like [?] they card, nigga gon' end up back on the wall
And we ain't gon' play with these boys unless they worried 'bout the dogs
'Cause you'll get left faced down, sunny side up
My son, [?] outside, she rollin' the weed
You're all left in to heal, he poppin' this E (Jeff), ayy

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Lotta baguettes on me
Got a lotta baguettes on me
Got a lotta baguettes on me
Got a lotta baguettes on me
Got a lotta baguettes on me
Got a lotta baguettes on me with the Rollie
Got a lotta baguettes on me with the Pa-ta-tek
Got a lotta baguettes on me

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
What you got, you got a Rollie? A Pa-ta-tek?
Whole lotta Rollies & Pa-ta-teks
And I got a AP with the bezel
Lotta APs, nigga, bang it
Bling, bling on me right now
Lotta jewelry on me right now
Lean, lean on me right now
Swerve in the McLaren right now

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Woah, please don't test on me, got a lotta stress on me
Yeah, I got my ex on me, she wanna put a hex on me
All black tint 'round me, with the whitest baguettes, whitest Piguet
Life after death, yeah, that count as success
And I can't pretend like I shouldn't walk around with that vest on my test day, if I read where my heart at
I just fucked around and spent a two year contract like, bsh, bsh, go and buy your mama a new compact
I'm a star, I'm a common thing, you like a comet, yeah, I'm in alignment, why you bitches lying?
I didn't change the game up, boy, I helped designed it
You going against me? You need Elijah, Muhammad
I knocked down the walls in my head, freed my mind up
I'm so fucking conscious, that shit is my compass
And all I want to do is spend these blue strips
With my main girl, fuck a new bitch, yeah (Don)

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Please don't leave me, no
Mufasa, she sexy lady
Wheezy Beats
Ooh, rastafari
Ooh, wait
We made love inside the booth last week and I still smell it
Mmm, mmm, I still smell it
Eat it like peanut butter and jelly
I got a Lear jet, slow it down with chicks, hey

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Lotta baguettes on me
Lotta baguettes on me
Lotta baguettes on me
Got a lotta baguettes on me
Lotta baguettes on me
Lotta baguettes on me
Got a lotta baguettes on me
Yeah, I got a lotta baguettes on me

[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
What you got, you got a Rollie? A Pa-ta-tek?
Whole lotta Rollies & Pa-ta-teks
And I got a AP with the bezel
Lotta APs, nigga, bang it
Bling, bling on me right now
Lotta jewelry on me right now
Lean, lean on me right now
Swerve in the McLaren right now
