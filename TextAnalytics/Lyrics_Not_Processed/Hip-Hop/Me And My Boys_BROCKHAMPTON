Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Me and my boys, we just like [?], keep it in my pack
Me and my boys, we speak like Birdman, plus I'm like my dad
Me and my boys, me and my boys, boys, boys, boys
Me and my boys, me and my boys, boys, boys, boys

[Post-Chorus]
Me and my boys (Me and my boys)
Me and my boys (Me and my boys)
That's me and my shawty
Me and my shawty
Me and my boys (Me and my boys)
Me and my boys (Me and my boys)
That's me and my shawty
Me and my shawty, oh
