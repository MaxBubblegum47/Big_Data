[Intro: Jay 305]
Yeah! What's happening?
First of all, I'm Westside Jay 305 right here with my nigga, Ty
Going down this road we come from, South Central and all
Seen a lot of bullshit
Through the bullshit, we fell into politics
From politics, we trying to get rich
Being a real one, you gotta stay on your grind
You gotta stay being a man, you gotta stay having a plan
But back to the bullshit, fuck the bullshit
These niggas don't know - fuck you hoes
Bitch!

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
These niggas don't know, these niggas really don't know
What it takes to be a real one
Cause I ain't never snitched on a nigga
Never put a bitch over my niggas
These niggas don't know, these niggas really don't know
What it takes to really be the man
I put on for my city
Look how many niggas got on with me

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
These niggas ain't nothing
These niggas just bluffing
These niggas just started getting hoes
And still ain't got no money, tho
These niggas still renting cars
That Lamborghini ain't yours
Tell me why niggas front
Homie, let me teach you how to stunt
It's realness over millions
You niggas fake it 'til you make it, tho
It's love over money
Won't put a bitch over my niggas, tho
Yeah I done seen a lot of fake shit
This bitch ain't bad, she basic
These niggas ain't saying shit

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
These niggas don't know, these niggas really don't know
What it takes to be a real one
Cause I ain't never snitched on a nigga
Never put a bitch over my niggas
These niggas don't know, these niggas really don't know
What it takes to really be the man
I put on for my city
Look how many niggas got on with me

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
It's the young and acquiring, got 'em all inquiring
Working extra late to get that early retirement
Taking vacays when my mind needs a rewiring
Everything I want is not a want, it's a requirement
She asked how much publishing I made off of my BMI
And even though she gave me TNA, I told her TMI
I'm living the life you read about
Lately, I've been drinking and taking vitamins, hoping it evens out
Nigga, what you know about grinding straight for a thousand nights
Before I hit a home run, swear I had a thousand strikes
Chilling with bad bitches, taking naked pictures
Fuck a thousand dollars, she gonna do it for a thousand likes
Goddamn, it's crazy what a cold bitch could do for hot sand
It's crazy what a young bitch will do to old men
For her own car, own Benz
Then lie like, "Y'all fuck?" "Naw, we just hold hands"
These niggas don't know

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
These niggas don't know, these niggas really don't know
What it takes to be a real one
Cause I ain't never snitched on a nigga
Never put a bitch over my niggas
These niggas don't know, these niggas really don't know
What it takes to really be the man
I put on for my city
Look how many niggas got on with me
