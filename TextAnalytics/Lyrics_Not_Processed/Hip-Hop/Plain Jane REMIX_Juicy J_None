[Intro: Nicki Minaj & 
A$AP Ferg
]
Young Money
Ayo, Ferg
Yeah

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Herm√®s link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his gut, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I'll fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo' ho if yo' bitch keep eyein' me

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Yeah)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (You already know, Harlem)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Queens)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Queens for the Kings of the Queens)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I'ma explain why you prolly never see me
I push a Lamborghini, chocha magic like Houdini
My body shaped like Jeannie, booty dreamy, waist is teeny
Yes, I told him to get TIDAL, so he stream me when he leave me
I go hard in the booth, Biggie vibes, gimme the loot
I'm a classy millionaire, bitches ain't got the couth
C-O-U-T-H 'cause you can't spell it either
If I call him then he comin' home runnin', Derek Jeter
Bitches must be eatin' ass, because I swear they're bottom feeders
Ho, you know that you my son, I shoulda scrapped you as a fetus
All these bitches rockin' inches 'cause they followin' the leader
I should switch it up on hoes and rock a Afro like Lupita's
I don't keep up with the Joneses, but I do know Catherine Zeta
I'm with Candice, TT, Thembi, and Viola, mi amiga
Rap bitches, they gotta check in with the Queen
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, everything in between, uh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Ride with Minaj, mmh Mashallah
Check in with me, then do your job
Queen is the name, Rafaello did the chain
This is Monse, Patty Plain Jane
Ride with Minaj, mmh Mashallah
Check in with me, then do your job
Queen is the name, Rafaello did the chain
This is Monse, Patty Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Eat a Barbie ass or somethin'
Eat a Barbie ass or somethin'
Eat a Barbie ass or somethin'
Eat a Barbie ass or somethin'
