[Chorus: Maty Noyes]
Where did you come from? How did you get here?
I tried to solve it, but my brain does not reply
How did you fall into my equation
Tried to subtract love, but it only multiplied
What a beautiful problem, you're my beautiful problem
What a beautiful problem, you're my beautiful problem

[Verse 1: MOD SUN]
Ever since I saw you, I knew you was a little bit crazy
But, baby, maybe you're the one to save me
I'm all you, nothing I won't do
Walk straight through Hell just to get to Heaven
If you were standing there waiting, yeah
And I could go on living without you
But I won't, but I won't
And I could tell you all that'll happen
But I don't, but I don't, no

[Pre-Chorus: MOD SUN]
And I gotta let you go and make your own mistakes
But I swear to catch you on the way down
And since the day we met, I knew we were meant to be
But I swear, I just can't explain how

[Chorus: Maty Noyes]
Where did you come from? How did you get here?
I tried to solve it, but my brain does not reply
How did you fall into my equation
Tried to subtract love, but it only multiplied
What a beautiful problem, you're my beautiful problem
What a beautiful problem, you're my beautiful problem

[Verse 2: MOD SUN]
I ask myself, how did we end up here
Thinking 'bout all the things we did and done, yeah
We're a little different, I think it's terrific
Never been embarrassed
Introduced you to my parents, even took you to Paris
It could be so simple, you just gotta let go
And take all the issues, get 'em under control
Cause if there's one thing that I know
Is that all those little problems are really beautiful

[Pre-Chorus: MOD SUN]
And I gotta let you go and make your own mistakes
But I swear to catch you on the way down
And since the day we met, I knew we were meant to be
But I swear, I just can't explain how
Chorus: Maty Noyes 
& gnash
Where did you come from? How did you get here?
I tried to solve it, but my brain does not reply
How did you fall into my equation
Tried to subtract love, but it only multiplied
What a beautiful problem, you're my beautiful problem
What a beautiful problem, you're my beautiful problem

[Bridge: gnash]
I write out replies to try and divide you from my life
But it won't come out right
I thought I'd live my life with you by my side
I guess I'll admit I'm not good with goodbyes
Maybe in time, or someday I'll find
A way to get you to get out of my mind
I thought I'd live my life with you by my side
I guess I'll admit I'm not good with goodbyes

[Outro: Maty Noyes & gnash]
What a beautiful problem, you're my beautiful problem
What a beautiful problem, you're my beautiful problem
