[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Chapter one is hello in a crowded room
Chapter two is call me, I can't stop thinkin’ 'bout you
Chapter three, you kiss me and the world goes black
But I wanna go deeper than that

[Chorus]
Give me all your secrets
Give me your hometown
Give me meet your mama
Don't leave nothin’ out
Everything that came before me
Even all the broken parts
Every chapter of your story
Write it on my heart

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
When you meet somebody and you just know
How the next hundred years are gonna go
All the stars that faded, all your crazy dreams
Tell me, I wanna know everything

[Chorus]
Give me all your secrets
Give me your hometown
Give me meet your mama
Don't leave nothin' out
Everything that came before me
Even all the broken parts
Every chapter of your story
Write it on my heart

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, oh

[Chorus]
Give me all your issues
Give me all your time
Give me your forever
And I'll give you mine
Everything that came before me
Even all the broken parts
Every chapter of your story
Write it on my heart

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Write it on my heart
