[Chorus]
Lil' mama got body, lil' mama got smarts
I took her home and I ripped her apart
Stole a hotbox and I sold it for parts
Already rich, I'ma trap for the art
Already high, I just smoke for the taste
Ain't got no L's, I took 12 on a chase
30K CPN, it came from Chase (WindyGotHits)
I swear you won't believe how much I made (Moreno on the beat, boy)
Ain't tryna go broke, so I gotta save
Chevron plastic, I swipe for a chain
Then got a BP card and did the same
Rooms To Go credit, I got a free sofa
Then got a lil' bitch and she bent it over
Can't let you play me, I'm not a controller
All of these flavors, I'm plugged like a modem
She on my dick, got these hoes on my scrotum
I'm on these Runtz and this shit is so potent
Burnin' on Oreos, no, not the cookies
But I just bust down a bale, it was Cookies
I'm eating lunch with your bitch, playing footsie
Thousand-pound load, man, that shit was a doozy
Citrus OG, man, this shit tastin' fruity
She left her boyfriend, she said he a goofy
Money Man Perry, my life is a movie

[Verse]
Money Man Perry, my life is a movie
My girl booty juicy, my soldiers salutin'
This OG is fruity, this weed is a hybrid
This car don't need gas, so this car is a hybrid
Lost some partners to violence, that shit had me cryin'
I be always recordin', so I ain't got time
Had to turn that bitch down 'cause I know her intentions
That 4x4 truck with the big boy extension
The ESV Escalade, that shit extended
My money be tall, man, that shit ain't no midget
My bitch pussy water, she fuck me exquisite
I pull in Teslas, I pull up in Fiskers
I run up that money, I run up them digits
If you not a real one, then you look suspicious
She swallow my semen, she say it nutritious
I'm tryna get rich, so I hustle relentless
Yeah
I sold weed at my school, I ain't care 'bout no physics, yeah
Yeah
I got hoes from the past textin', "Tysen, I miss you"
Yeah
I got friends I grew up with and now they got issues, yeah
I gotta let this motherfucker breathe
I can keep going, but bring that motherfuckin' hook in, yeah

[Chorus]
Lil' mama got body, lil' mama got smarts
I took her home and I ripped her apart
Stole a hotbox and I sold it for parts
Already rich, I'ma trap for the art
Already high, I just smoke for the taste
Ain't got no L's, I took 12 on a chase
30K CPN, it came from Chase
I swear you won't believe how much I made
Ain't tryna go broke, so I gotta save
Chevron plastic, I swipe for a chain
Then got a BP card and did the same
Rooms To Go credit, I got a free sofa
Then got a lil' bitch and she bent it over
Can't let you play me, I'm not a controller
All of these flavors, I'm plugged like a modem
She on my dick, got these hoes on my scrotum
I'm on these Runtz and this shit is so potent
Burnin' on Oreos, no, not the cookies
But I just bust down a bale, it was Cookies
I'm eating lunch with your bitch, playing footsie
Thousand-pound load, man, that shit was a doozy
Citrus OG, man, this shit tastin' fruity
