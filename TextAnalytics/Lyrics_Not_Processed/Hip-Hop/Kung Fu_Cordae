[Intro]
Day-Day-Daytrip took it to 10

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil' ho, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil' nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains
, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans

[Post-Chorus]
Ayy, hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (Ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat
 (Ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell momma I'ma quit but I love cash

[Verse 1]
I'ma just get it and get it again
Come ups I split with my friends, ayy
Twenty's them twenty's them twinny twin twin
Tryna flip Ford to a Benz
I'ma get it, I'ma get it regardless
Bussin juugs, 
I used to trap out the college
Give me brain, I swear that bitch is a scholar
No snakes around me, only snake on my collar
I'm a thief in the night, pray to Jesus, to Christ
Better hope he believe in your life
Free my lil' nigga Saudi, was catching them bodies
He fighting his demons to light
All my niggas be trapping, your niggas be rapping
They robbed you, you asking what happened
Got a new bitch from China, she wearing designer
I'm lacing her in the new fashion, ayy

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil' ho, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil' nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans

[Post-Chorus]
Ayy, hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (Ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat
 (Ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell momma I'ma quit but I love cash

[Verse 2]
Ayy, I've been all around the fucking globe
Baby what ya know?
Motherfucker better tuck and roll, got places to go
And niggas missed the last flight, livin' in the fast life
Momma said, "You never act right, goddamn"
Guess I'm a bad guy, 
but I'm on my grind like a halfpipe
'Cause I switch it and flip it and cook it up mad nice
'Til I see them flashlights, then I'm gone
Fast flash like, my future's a tad bright
Because when they rent is due, and your Benz is new
And your old friends be resenting you
Like my women brown, 
and my Benjis blue
Shit is fucked up, when they envy you
'Member niggas got killed over Penny shoes
Where I'm from niggas dying like Kenny do
Take a hit of this PAC and this Henny juice
Only one of me, but there's plenty you
It was all a dream, reminiscing over smaller things
Grandma cooking like Paula Deen
It ain't all it seems, grew up with the starving teens
And growing plants, still watering (ahh)

[Chorus]
Let me tell you how I come through with the 1-2
Kickin' shit like kung fu
Treat a bad bitch like she average
I'm a savage, lil' ho, what you wan' do?
I'm about cash if the route fast
I'ma get that lil' nigga, by any means
Momma complain 'bout my Balmains, but it's all sane
Couple racks in my skinny jeans

[Post-Chorus]
Ayy, hit it up, one time
Niggas gonna get it until the sunrise (Ayy)
School of hard knocks, I'm alumni
Bitches on my dick like fungi
Won't stop, what's that?
Keep the Tommy on me like a Rugrat
 (Ayy)
Niggas used to trap where the bus at
Tell Momma I'ma quit but I love cash

[Outro]
Daytrip took it to 10
