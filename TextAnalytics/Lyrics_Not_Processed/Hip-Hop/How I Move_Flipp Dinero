[Intro: Flipp Dinero]
Yeah, I really run it up, yeah
I really run it up, yeah
I really run it up, yeah
I really run it up, yeah 
(Spazzin' out, Pluto, spazzin' out, Pluto)

[Pre-Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
I really run it up, yeah
Ain't play no games with this shit
I got that worker from Polo then hit up my guala
Then told him, "We made for this shit"
Niggas stay workin' for commas, we stack up that guala
See, I put my name on this shit
Flipp with that smoke, on that ganja, I bang for that comma
See, I put my name on this shit

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
Hol' up, you (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I —

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I really run it up, baby
If the topic is money, I'm comin' up
She gon' suck 'til I pop without comin' up
I'm the man in the front, you the runner up
Really don't give a fuck, yeah
How I move, way I talk, they try pick it up
I can call when I want, she be pickin' up
Niggas' bitches, they really be switchin' up
Can't play no game, I got too much to lose
Want me to fall, I got somethin' to prove
Really steal with no trace, I won't leave 'em a clue
And the truck lookin' reggae, I painted it blue
If it's me and my shawty, we hop in the coupe
My lil' youngins go crazy, they lovin' the crew
He handle business, can't wait to recruit him
Pop me a Addy, tryna make me a movie
I can't stand still when my diamonds keep movin' (Movin')
Gave all my heart, tryna guide 'em to do it
Got partners who gon' tryna guide 'em with music
Lil' bro don't play 'round, if he got it, he use it (Use it)
Go against us, nigga gotta be stupid
Ride 'round with the stick, how I gotta be movin' (Man)
Everyday lit and them commas be movin'
This shit we be doin' inside of a movie

[Pre-Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
I really run it up, yeah
Ain't play no games with this shit
I got that worker from Polo then hit up my guala
Then told him, "We made for this shit"
Niggas stay workin' for commas, we stack up that guala
See, I put my name on this shit
Flipp with that smoke, on that ganja, I bang for that comma
See, I put my name on this shit

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
Hol' up, you (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch —
Hol' up, you (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I —

[Verse 2: Flipp Dinero]
Rollie don't tick but it got big rocks
Bands in the whip, do the dash from the cops
Chain lookin' bliss, with the pole on my hip (Ayy)
Let me go, I'm equipped, but don't bang with the opps (Ooh)
Pain to regret but it's more that I get
Really made for this shit, money made, it don't stop
Say Heaven sent, I was made for the flip
I was made for this shit and I bang for the block (What?)
Beam and a Jag', got the Benz' on the lot
Went and copped me a crib just to park up the drop (Benz, Benz, gang, gang)
Fuck do you mean? I was lost in the drought (Ayy)
Got the bag comin' into the stars and I'm out (What?)
Money comin' in so you know a nigga goin' (Damn)
Thou on the flip so you know a nigga throw it (What?)
Style ever since in the game I'ma get
Got no time for this shit, get the bag and you know it, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
I really run it up, yeah
Ain't play no games with this shit
I got that worker from Polo then hit up my guala
Then told him, "We made for this shit"
Niggas stay workin' for commas, we stack up that guala
See, I put my name on this shit
Flipp with that smoke, on that ganja, I bang for that comma
See, I put my name on this shit

[Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
Hol' up, you (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch —
Hol' up, you (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I move (Yeah)
You said they watch how I —
