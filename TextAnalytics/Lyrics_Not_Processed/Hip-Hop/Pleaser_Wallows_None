[Verse 1: Dylan]
You're talking while you're fast asleep
As I walk slowly from your house
Back in your room remain the words I wanna say to you
But couldn't leave my mouth
Does it come as a surprise?
Language of averted eyes
Silence is what I do best

[Pre-Chorus: Dylan]
Still, I hear it all
Wasting time around my head
So I talk to myself instead

[Chorus: Braeden]
Sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how
It's something that I can't do
Then what am I supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only I could please her

[Verse 2: Braeden]
Indecisive feelings of enjoyment
Hold the thought, I think I need a moment
I'm aware there's somethin' I should tell you
But my voice annoys me
Bite my tongue off with a smile
I can't feel it anymore
'Cause recently the line is blurred
Between depression and bliss

[Pre-Chorus: Braeden]
Now I see that the times don't change
They waste away
But I just wanna sleep today
And I don't wanna talk to you right now
You say

[Chorus: Braeden]
But, I'm sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how
It's something that I can't do
Then what am I supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only I could please her

[Bridge: Dylan & Braeden]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Dylan & Braeden]
I'm talking while you're next to me
Did I ruin the moment?
If I could tell you how I feel
Would you know what the words meant?
For sake of conversation
Could you read the writings on my sleeve?
'Cause that's the best you're gonna get
So maybe I had better leave
