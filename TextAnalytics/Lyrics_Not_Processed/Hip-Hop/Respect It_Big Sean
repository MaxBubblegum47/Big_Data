Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
You can't touch me, you not worthy, dirty bitches don't deserve me
I be careful who I love 'cause who I love is who could hurt me
I’ma give that ass a cruel summer, Lamborghini Murcié
Niggas thought they had the twenty-twenty vision, it’s still blurry (Woah)
I done dodged the murder rates, I done earned what they can't take
Pull up to the house, you thought you died and seen the pearly gates
Nowadays, respect the ones who talkin’ good behind my back
And say the bad shit to my— (Woah) to my face
Why complain about things I can change? Yeah (I can change)
Soldiers 'round me, we done been through major pain (Major pain)
Laser focused, AOL, been had AIM
Got a lot of hunnids, stayed a hunnid, life just changed, uh (Life done changed)
What you do when you got bitches blowin' you kisses? (Kisses)
Opposition sendin' death wishes (Damn), either way, it made me no difference
I done outdid the predictions, I’m a underground king
Always had the tunnel vision, I'm consistently consistent

[Chorus: Big Sean, Big Sean & Young Thug, Young Thug]
So ain't nobody finna do me any type of way (Way)
Ain't nobody finna do dat (Yeah)
Ain't nobody finna do me any type of way (Respect)
Ain't nobody finna do me dirty, no way (Respect it)
Ain't nobody finna do me any type of way (Type of way)
Ain't nobody finna do dat (Ayy)
Ain't nobody finna do me any type of way
Ain't nobody finna do me dirty, no way

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Monday Magic, Tuesday (Woo)
Spent a quarter million on the Gucci (Ayy)
Wednesday, he had ranned up on me, I got ruthless
Thursday, I'm Ferrari horsin', niggas moosin', yeah
I just had to wake up and pay Uncle Sam today, woo
I been in the trenches giving back like anyway (No cap)
I just bought the pinkie Berkie' for my Easter baby
Got her throwin' diamonds in the air like it's a playpen
Can't let 'em trick me out of nothin' long as I'm livin'
I can't let her go out sad as long as I'm gettin' it
I won't never hold a freak ho against her will
Still wouldn't let 'em do me any kinda way with no seal

[Chorus: Big Sean, Big Sean & Young Thug]
Ain't nobody finna do me any type of way
Ain't nobody finna do dat
Ain't nobody finna do me any type of way (Respect)
Ain't nobody finna do me dirty, no way (Respect it)

[Bridge: Big Sean & Young Thug]
Can't no one do me dirty
Can't no one do me like that, no
Can't no one do me dirty
Can't no one do me like that, no
I know, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Can't nobody do me dirty, bitch (Bitch)
All that fake shit over, we don't take, we take shit over
Army, Navy, paper soldiers
Cut the grass and face the cobras
I'm a walking bucket list (Woah)
Product of my sufferin' (Woah)
Kobe at the Rucker, bitch
Triplin'-doublin', runnin' this shit
I learned that prayin' is God ammunition
Please let it rain down 'til it drown out my city (God)
The fruits of my labor came all to fruition
You talkin' bout "I," you ain't got no vision
"We, not me", lil' bitch
Built like we sell bricks
Fuck blogs, read my lips
Doin' me dirty the only thing that you won't do in this bitch, bitch

[Outro]
Bitch
