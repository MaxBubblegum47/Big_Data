Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..

Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..

[Verse 1 - Soulja Boy]
L-O-V-E M-O-N-E-Y
Cop the True Religion tee
And threw 300 in the sky
Polo shoes on my feet
And my pants are saggin’
Looking so pretty
You would’ve thought I was a faggot
Watch the hood get it
Cook it like chicken
And I got the combo
And it came with biscuits
And I got the combo (Respect in here)
And it came with biscuits (SOD)

[Soulja Boy (Big Sean)]
Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..

Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..

Yes I do love money (Yes, I Do)

Keep my whole clique stuntin’ (Yea that's right, Sean Don)
Yes I do love money (Yes, I Do, Detroit)
Keep my whole clique stuntin' (Oh my, GOD)
Yes I do love money (Oh My, GOD)
Nothing but them hundreds (Finally Famous, Gettin)
Keep them ones, don’t want em.. (Boi, Boi,Boi, I Do It)

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Why everything green is good for me?
I'm what these bitch ass niggas couldn’t be
6 miles that’s just the hood in me
Peep my ghetto poetry
I'm getting high and rappin’: that’s flowetry
Is that a green carpet? Now the whole floor a tree
I swear to God ain't no ho in me
But I'm in hoes
I'm probably in your ho
Aw shit there go a staple
At least you know my bitch centerfold
I belong in the Guinness
From most style I rented
Don’t fuck with these niggas
Im fuckin they misses
Im stacking my money
My money get interest
My interest get business
My business get bitches
B-I-G Bitch, I do it, Boi
