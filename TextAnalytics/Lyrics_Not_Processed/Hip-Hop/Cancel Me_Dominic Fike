[Chorus]
I hope they cancel me (Why? Why?)
So I can go be with my family (Why? Why?)
So I can quit wearin' this mask, dawg (Damn)
Tell the people, "Kiss my ass, dawg" (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I hope they crucify me (Why?)
I hope they put me down, I hope they euthanize me
I hope I never, ever have to go on TV
Mothafucka, Jimmy Kimmel does not wanna meet me
I told my manager, "No more parties in Los Angeles"
Last night, I fell deeper than BROCKHAMPTON down a rabbit hole
Did so much blow, I won’t never find my appetite
On my way home, I crashed into a satellite
That's why my phone was obsolete for half the night
That's why my dome is ringin’, baby
As of right now, my job is to lie down

[Chorus]
I hope they cancel me (Why? Why?)
So I can go be with my family (Why? Why?)
So I can quit wearin' this mask, dawg (Damn)
Tell the people, "Kiss my ass, dawg" (Yeah, yeah)
I hope they cancel me (Why? Why?)
So I can go be with my family (Why? Why?)
So I can quit wearin' this mask, dawg (Damn)
Tell the people, "Kiss my ass, dawg" (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Look, after tour, I broke up with my girlfriend (Why?)
To fuck a bunch of bitches that I couldn't back then
And yeah, that was cool, but now I'm empty as my room
I guess my Insta keep me busy, I got plenty things to do
But I told Reed, "No more of this LA shit"
Last night keeps flashin' and I can't take it (One sec)
Shut that phone up 'fore I break it (Hol’ up)
Take me home before I say it
I hope they banish me, I miss my family tree
I was a family man, and now I’m just a man to see
If you can't pay your rent or be responsible financially
They need you, I hope I get Me Too’d

[Chorus]
I hope they cancel me (Why? Why?)
So I can go be with my family (Why? Why?)
So I can quit wearin' this mask, dawg (Damn)
Tell the people, "Kiss my ass, dawg" (Yeah, yeah)
I hope they cancel me (Why? Why?)
So I can go be with my family (Why? Why?)
So I can quit wearin' this mask, dawg (Damn)
Tell the people, "Kiss my ass, dawg" (Yeah, yeah)
