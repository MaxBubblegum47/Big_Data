[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Bag it up, I keep trapping
Used to not afford no dollar menu, now I be Big Mac, kid
Getting kicked out of 
PAX
, that's a past tense now
When I'm in that bitch, they polite as a pastor
Bag it up, on the road
Time to go back to war
All the things that I said I'd do, I went and did
All my fault, on my own but, kid, I said that shit
Bag it up, on the road
Time to go, every day, do the things that I say
Bag it up, on the road
Gotta go, every day, do the things that I say

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Damn, borrow mine
She ain't need to say it 'til I bother mind
Bag in the back 'til I bother mind
Bag in the back 'til I bother mind

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
My biggest issue is I can't have a kid
Okay, I'm lying, got some other fucking issues, bitch
I always wonder what that's like on the other side
Guess I'll get to see it whenever my mother dies
I'm sorry mom for making songs about the shit you done
You been the greatest, no excuse for a shitty son
Moved to progressive Californ-I-A, I switched up
I was raised where some niggas gettin' lynched up
If you ain't playin' ball or throwin' sets up
Was getting jumped on for trying to play dress-up
I'm tired of seeing niggas that I hate copy me
I'm tired of homophobic niggas that follow me
They're probably same type of niggas that'll swallow me
I know you think that shit was weak but that was tongue-in-cheek
Put the tongue to the cheek, pose for the pic
You all look the same, niggas getting desperate
You want some fucking love?
You want some Instagram likes? You're posted in the club
I'm in the hotel room on tour, man
Set the stu' up everywhere I go man
I liked Wayne when I was in the fucking sixth grade
That's why Ashlan keep the camera on me all day
A young Spike Jonze, movies on my iPhone
This music shit is cool, wait to see what
(I got more, I got more, keep it rolling, keep it rolling)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Made me wanna kill me, skin like armadillo
America the new Sodom, feel it in my blood
Let the gold drape my neck, let the silver grip my knuckles
When they ask you who shot 'em
Nobody doing jail time, nobody paying consequence
Silence when it rest, words murder all the time
Now this shit offset, now my bitch upset
Yeah, I creep upstream
I'ma bury till they send me, I'm a gun to the human
I'm a psychopath
I'm a menace, man, with no dentist plan after 27
Offset, offset, I'm a scape rat (scape rat)
I'm a mallrat with that palm sweat on my white tee (white tee)
I'm like sight, see on my CC (yo, CEO)
I need us, I need love, I need hope (ahh)
To keep me going
I need to keep them doors open
I ain't talk unless the cash there
With denim and cashmere
Crib in Japan, sushi in my hand
Recording everything, bang on the thing
Black everything

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Verse 4: Joba]
I don't wanna seem too blunt
But I can't get behind this bullshit
I mean everything you do is a nuisance
And you say you wanna ride with the shooters?
If that's true, forgive me if I'm wrong
But I'ma bet my life on it, you don't even own a gun
Wave hi as I stand outside (hi!) with my short-shorts on
You sneak a picture, there's a shoobie on yo front lawn
Hit you on the head with my flip-flop, I spin in the air like I did that
Gotta layin' low 'til I flip out, I'm a bit imbalanced, I know
20/20 vision, I'm watching, you built a career off of problems
You ain't ever deal with this toxic, you should be ashamed
I see right through the facade, you must think everyone's blind
I don't play into the lies, just thought you should know

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
