[Verse 1]
Listen to me I've got a warning for you
You've got to learn to take more care
Because if you swim in dirty water
Be careful how you dry your hair
In a room within a room
In a hole within a hole
You've got to learn to share your secrets
Or you'll lose your soul

[Chorus]
I've got the evidence I know you're broke
The unwritten law
Another town, another one-night stand
You know, you broke the law

[Verse 2]
It's so hard to hold back
When the fire is in your eyes
A silver dollar in my pocket
I don't like surprises
I've got your souvenir
Is that the price I've got to pay
It hasn't been that long
Since the last charade

[Chorus]
I've got the evidence I know you're broke
The unwritten law
Another town, another one-night stand
You know, you broke the law

[Verse 3]
I know you're guilty
But I'm carrying the blame
I took out much more than I put in
And I felt the pain
In a dirty little room
With nowhere left to hide
You told the truth with your eyes
But you lied inside

[Chorus]
I've got the evidence I know you're broke
The unwritten law
Another town, another one-night stand
You know, you broke the law
I've got the evidence I know you're broke
The unwritten law
Another town, another one-night stand
You know, you broke the law
