[Verse 1: Luh Kel]
You got me tweakin' (Tweakin')
All in my feelings
Oh, but I like it (Yeah)
I can't deny it (Yeah)
You know what you doing
Give brain like a Bruin
Oh you be wildin', when I'm inside it
No cappin you got me
Your face and your body
It drive me insane
I'm sending your pictures
To all of my niggas
Like that's my bae
And I never felt this way
Ohh bae
Oh, she got me open
Her Nina fully loaded
The way it's killing me
Oh, Murda yea she wrote it
I'm swimming at the bottom
Uhh when I'm in your ocean
And don't you ever leave
No I can't see you going

[Chorus: Luh Kel]
Girl you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
And all your love, yeah you know I need it
Girl you got me feenin'
And you got me tweakin
And all your love yea you know, ooo, I need it
It's all day and all night
You stay on my mind
Girl you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
And all your love yea you know, ooo, I need it

[Verse 2: IV.JAY]
Tell me you gon' ride for me
Spend some time with me
Say you tryna be my everything
Then that's fine with me
I ain't never going to lie to you
So don't you lie to me
Know that you can have my heart if
You just treat it properly
Cause I ain't never felt this way
You really doing something to me
I'm feenin', I'm tweaking, I'm doing the most tonight
I'm not going to lie, I'm scared that you ain't mine
Baby keep it real, do you run the game
Tell me if there's other girls up in your face
Cause they could never have you cause I have you
And I ain't one to brag boo but I have too

[Chorus: Luh Kel]
Girl you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
And all your love yea you know I need it
Girl you got me feenin'
And you got me tweakin'
And all your love yea you know I need it
It's all day and all night
You stay on my mind
Girl you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
And all your love yea you know I need it

[Bridge: Luh Kel & 
 IV.JAY
]
When I feel alone I know baby you'll help
Know that you don't need nobody else I know you well
Sometimes I be tweakin' and don't trip on how you feel
I rather be with you because I'm no good by myself

[Hook: IV.JAY & 
Luh Kel
]
Boy you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
All your love yea you know that I need it
Girl you got me feenin'
And you got me tweakin'
And all your love yea you know I need it
It's all day and all night
You stay on my mind
Girl you got me feenin'
Got me in the deep end
And all your love yea you know I need it
