[Chorus: Ava Max & 
Saweetie
]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast (
Saweetie
)
To all of the queens who are fighting alone (
Ava
)
Baby, you're not dancing on your own (
Yeah, Lauv, let's go
)

[Verse 1: Ava Max]
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ava Max]
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me (Save me)
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me (Tame me)
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

[Chorus: Ava Max & 
Lauv
]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone (
Uh
)
Baby, you're not dancing on your own (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)

[Verse 2: Lauv & 
Ava Max
]
She's the queen and I'm just lucky to get close to the throne
I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy, but she's taking me home, yeah (
Oh
)

[Pre-Chorus: Lauv]
No damsel in distress, don't need to save her
She's a goddess, I will never try to change her
She know she got my world inside of her palm
But she can have whatever she wants

[Chorus: Ava Max & 
Lauv
]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne (
Yeah, baby
)
We would pop champagne and raise a toast (
Ooh, ooh, yeah
)
To all of the queens who are fighting alone (
Fighting alone
)
Baby, you're not dancing on your own (
Woo
)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Saweetie]
Let's go
I'm a queen, I'm a boss, I'm a brat (Yeah)
Hella independent, I get this, I get that (Uh-uh)
Shout out to the girls from the 'burb to the trap
I don't need a man for shit, put myself on the map (Oh)
And they thought I was done
I ain't even hit my peak and I'm still on the run
I'm like Lolo on the laps how I'm runnin' the track
Only time I see a L's on the luxury tax
And my whole team winning
Post a pic just because, they like, "Oh, she chilling" (Yeah)
Million-dollar deals and my lipstick seal it
I need acrylic nails, I don't need no critics (Facts)
Saweetie gon' glow, Saweetie gon' shine (Yeah)
Takeoff for the tens, I don't see no nines
My name on they lips, my name on they minds
How I take it from the block to the Hollywood sign

[Chorus: Ava Max]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

[Outro: Ava Max]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
