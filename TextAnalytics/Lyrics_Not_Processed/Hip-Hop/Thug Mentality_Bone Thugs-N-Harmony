[Chorus]
T-H-U-G we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' (It's the way I choose to live my life)
T-H-U-G we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' (Thuggin' 'til the day I die)
T-H-U-G we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' (It's the way I choose to live my life)
T-H-U-G we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' (Thuggin' 'til the day I die)

[Verse 1]
I done been around the world and everywhere it be the same song
Niggas strugglin' daily gotta survive, it's worldwide
Even niggas from Paris to London be hustlin'
Doin' whatever to get the money
Lookin' at the whole world wide of thugs, but you got to keep it real if you want to make it through with the biz
And make them dollars for your kids
Gotta handle your business, gotta get in it to win it and then you gotta get up outta there
And that's real really, my thugs feel me
Put your fists up in the air, yeah
Nigga, come into the war and I'ma meet you niggas there
Ready to rumble, and I swear, we coming from everywhere
Where my thugs at, where they at? Fuck that
Nigga, let's do in the enemy now
Terminate, eliminate 'em
Takin' out they frustration on the world, get 'em back for playa hatin'
So come on, we gotta roll
And wouldn't you know, they ain't ready for the war
While they rest, take some
Give the rest to the poor, we in total control
Make 'em feel the pain in 2-double-0-0
It's the end of the road, so what you gon' do?
I'ma ride, you can die if you want to (Want to)
But all them real, so just come on, move
Get your suits on, boots on, keep troopin' on
T-H (T-H) U-G (U-G), that's what we be
Across the nation, pump your fist and get ready for this occasion
Nigga better the fade on, I wanna see victory
Y'all niggas better roll with this, 'cause we splittin' 'em
Fuck that, we with it
That's thug mentality

[Chorus]
T-H-U-G we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' (It's the way I choose to live my life)
T-H-U-G we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' (Thuggin' 'til the day I die)

Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' (Thuggin' 'til the day I die)

[Verse 2]
Every thug, if you wanna be a thug, nigga, thug if you got to
Throw it up, keep it in the air, scream it out
"Thug! (Thug!) Thug! (Thug!)" Thuggin' 'til the day I die
What am I? If you look into my eyes, you'll truly find
No kind like I, gemini, gotta control both sides
My lordy lord maintain, hard, 'cause I'm a soldier at war
Steady runnin' with the weapon 'cause it still ain't gettin' better
I figured it out, it's all real
If it ain't, then it ain't right
Come on, if you wanna feel the thug love, and it's real
We got the real thing, baby
I hate to burn ya, learn ya, stay out it if, it don't concern ya
You don't really want to get involved with the murder
But, shit, if you want it, you got it, we bring it, it don't stop
We gone pop shots still to the double Glock Glock
Never taking no shorts, no losses man
Yes, these days are still the same like, gotta make that money mane, bang
Gotta get down for my thang and I do it so smooth
When I'm stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves
Now I'm on the run witta me shotgun, but I'm blinded so
Y'all can't fuck with the thuggish ruggish (ruggish) Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
That's thug mentality

[Chorus]
T-H-U-G we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' (It's the way I choose to live my life)
T-H-U-G we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' (Thuggin' 'til the day I die)
T-H-U-G we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' (It's the way I choose to live my life)
T-H-U-G we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' (Thuggin' 'til the day I die)
