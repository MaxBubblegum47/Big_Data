[Intro: Future]
You know what's going on, yeah
Over there and over there, okay
Cut it up!

[Chorus: Future & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maseratis all day (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Blasé, blasé every day
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé every day
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Blasé, blasé, blasé, all I drink is Bombay
When I'm with my niggas, I might drink that Henny
Smoking kush in public, motherfuck the police
I ain't scared to die, on them dead homies
Hit them licks, wh-whipping the bricks
Still, with the shit, I'm young and I'm rich, young and I'm rich
I got hoes, nigga, I got hoes in different area codes
I think I'm Nate Dogg
I started from the ground, I'm that nigga now
I stay with the loud, can you hear me now?
And my bitch cold, she a centerfold
Put her on a stand, and she never told

[Chorus: Future, Ty Dolla $ign & Slim Jxmmi]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maseratis all day (Skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr)
Blasé, blasé every day
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé every day
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé (Every day)
Whipping Maserati (Skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr, Sremm Life)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah
(Ain't nothin' but some Sremm Life shit)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
I break the bank like an athlete, hon
Shawty krunk drunk, fucking up her new Louboutins
If I let her in my Masi she might be a trending topic
Before she gotta ride it, bust it, pop it, blasé, blasé
Been spent your rent and I'm still blowing big faces
Something 'bout them Ben Franklins make any bitch get naked
Crew got the juice, bitch, you don't need no chasers
Ball on these niggas, I need knee replacements

[Chorus: Future & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maseratis all day (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Blasé, blasé every day
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé every day
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Sipping out the jug until I feel it in my body
I was, uh, hoping you were salty when you saw me
Keep a rowdy scene around me, all we do is dip and dab
Got twin turbos on twin turbos and them bitches really smash
It's a 50/50 chance I might ditch ya (ditch ya)
It's a 50/50 chance that these niggas didn't pitch in
I'm pouring up 'til I can't no more
I swear everything I see slow mo

[Chorus: Future & Ty Dolla $ign]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I'm just, whipping Maseratis all day (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Blasé, blasé every day
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé every day
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Future]

Alcohol and chronic, yeah, that's all we want
Alcohol and chronic, yeah, that's all we want
