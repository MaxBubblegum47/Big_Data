[Intro]
(You really, you really)
(You really, you really)

[Verse 1]
Your pussy is God and I love it
Gonna kiss me real hard, make me want it
I think star signs mean nothing
But I know you feel right so I'm coming
They say it gets hard when you're getting up
Been knocked down from some other love
But their best wasn't good enough
And you're number one to me

[Refrain]
You're extra special, something else
Or maybe it's you
And I've been looking for something I want
And baby, it's you, ahmm

[Verse 2]
Your pussy is God, and you know
I think you're so cute when you get high
I've never been good at this nice shit
But I can try if you like it
Sayin' it gets hard when you give a fuck
Get knocked down from some other love
But their best wasn't good enough
And you're number one to me

[Chorus]
(You really, you really)
(You really taught me how to)
You know that it's God, baby, when you're around her
(You really, you really)
I've been praying for hours
(You really taught me how to)
You know that it's God, baby, when you're around her
She's God and I've found her, oh
(You really, you really)

[Verse 3]
Your pussy is God, and I'm falling
We're on the same wave when we're talking
I've never been played in a good match
But I win when I hit that
Said, I'm cool if you love me, oh
Knocked down from some other love
But their best wasn't good enough
And you're better off with me

[Refrain]
You're extra special, something else
Or maybe it's you
And I've been looking for something I want
And baby, it's you, ahmm

[Chorus]
(You really taught me how to)
You know that it's God, baby, when you're around her
(You really, you really)
I've been praying for hours
(You really taught me how to)
You know that it's God, baby, when you're around her
She's God and I've found her, oh
(You really, you really)

[Bridge]
Oh (Baby, it's you)
Your pussy is God, and I love it (Baby, it's you)
Your pussy is God, and I love it
Gonna kiss me real hard, make me want it, ah (Baby, it's you)
Your pussy is God and I love it
Gonna kiss me real hard, ahmm

[Chorus]
(You really taught me how to)
You know that it's God, baby, when you're around her
(You really, you really)
I've been praying for hours
(You really taught me how to)
You know that it's God, baby, when you're around her
She's God and I've found her, oh
(You really, you really)
