[Intro]
Feel like I'm high up, yeah
I'm too high up
I'll let the light light up

[Verse 1]
Movin' too fast, now you caught in the middle
Try so hard to keep up, now you single
Bettin' you'll regret what you did just a little
Ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, what you think this is?
Why you wanna plead the fifth?
You ain't gotta tell me what it is
'Cause I saw the messages
You must got me fucked up
You must got me fucked up
I think I had enough

[Chorus]
So forgive me, forgive me
I been goin' too hard in your city
So forgive me 'cause I'm not teary
Best believe I'll move onto better things
Oh, you lie, oh, you lie
Give me back all my time
So forgive me, no, not really
Best believe I'll move onto better things

[Verse 2]
I've been sittin' here, watchin' you go insane
I've been sittin' here, watchin' us fade away
Baby, don't you see what you done threw away?
No one's hittin' you on the loop, on replay

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, what you think this is?
Why you wanna plead the fifth?
You ain't gotta tell me what it is
'Cause I saw the messages
You must got me fucked up
You must got me fucked up
I think I had enough

[Chorus]
So forgive me, forgive me
I been goin' too hard in your city
So forgive me 'cause I'm not teary
Best believe I'll move onto better things
Oh, you lie, oh, you lie
Give me back all my time
So forgive me, no, not really
Best believe I'll move onto better things

[Outro]
Goodbye, you stay wastin' time
No, you never try
You said this for life
But you know you lied
Catch you every time like
Lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
