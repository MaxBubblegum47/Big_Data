All my friends say I’m insane
But I take my pills everyday
Ring around the ROZIE
Everyone tryin to know me
But I'm so numbed up

They say my life is madness
Throwing parties in my palace
I know Weezy wouldn’t disagree
I know he’d smoke some weed with me
And I'm so numbed up

Don’t you want to be on my side for tonight
On my side for tonight?
Don’t you want to feel more alive for tonight
More alive for tonight?
Cause I
Know you want to fight it
Don’t try to fight it
Don’t you want to be on my side for tonight
On my side for tonight?

I'm so numb
Numbed up

NexXthursday:
Oh Yeah
I'm so numb
I swear to God I'm numb
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
Way too high
Too much 'tron
I can't feel a thing when I get drunk
So I need a ride
Yeah I need a ride
I'm too drunk to drive
And we need to slide (yeah)
Your friends say I'm bad for you
But you looking bad in my ride
Girl you should decide
If you down to let them decide
If I'm who you like
Cause I got no secrets
You got no secrets
That's what I love
I fuck with you cause you real
And I never felt nothing like yours
I got no feelings
When I'm on that low
Smoking sativa
Feeling so numb
Feeling so numb
I need a feeling bad girl cause I'm missing your touch

Im so numb
Numbed up

Strangers tying to pick my brain
Like what do you do with your days
I’m like bitch I got my own clique
Everybody’s trying to fit in
And I'm so numbed up

I got captain in my blood
But I'm the captain of this club
I know Miley wouldn’t disagree she’d instagram this shit with me
And I'm so numbed up

Don’t you want to be on my side for tonight On my side for tonight?
Don’t you want to feel more alive for tonight More alive for tonight?
Cause I
Know you want to fight it
Don’t try to fight it
Don’t you want to be on my side for tonight
On my side for tonight?
I'm so numb Numbed up
