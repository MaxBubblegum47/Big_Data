They say I'm rappin' like I'm 'bout that
I told 'em come and try  nigga if they doubt that
That fugazi ass chingy, he ain't pop that (squad)
Thuggin' like the '96 Pac back
Ain't no one-on-ones, if it was we should jump that
BSM shawty, we kill all rats (Salute)
Brrrat, ll these niggas asscheek
If you ask me, these niggas lamb meat (What we do?)
Feed 'em to the wolves then
Catch me by myself nigga, bet I'm still dumpin'

[Verse 2: Tyler The Creator]
Umm hey fella, how you doin'?
Well I'm doin' bad and I hope your day's ruined
When you're on stage I'm the one that's booing
'Cause I hate your guts, haha
I'll be in the bushes lurkin'
While you live life so goddamn perfect
'Cause my life sucks, and it serves no purpose
I'm gonna fuck yours up to make shit worth it
Faggot, why the fuck do you have it
Why the fuck don't I got it, and any way I can stop it, is perfect
Fuck your moms, dead homies, the bitch you sleep with
Fuck your food, the protein in it, that fork you eat with
I'll have your wife beat dick, get pregnant
Ad then make you think that it's yours
Now that's the real definition of sneak diss
I'm Silky Johnson's left hand, coming like the next trend
Sucks 'cause I'm your best friend, nigga

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah I'm a hater, fuck your wrist
Yeah I'm a hater, fuck your life
Yeah I'm a hater, nigga fuck your money
Fuck your car nigga, fuck your clique
Yeah I'm a hater, fuck your wrist
Yeah I'm a hater, nigga fuck your car
Yeah I'm a hater, nigga fuck your money
Nigga fuck your life, fuck your clique, squad

[Verse 3: Derez De'Shon]
Time is money, you can die today or tomorrow
Niggas trippin' like they forgot how much a body costs
I'm in the hood, nobody caught
All the chains lookin' like it's fuckin' Mardi Gras
My top down, seat way back
Disrespect the squad, get your face cracked
DT youngins claiming bodies for your state tax
Call the clean-up crew, no Ajax
When I'm wrong, I'm still right, who gon' say somethin'?
All that flexin' like my youngins won't take somethin'
DGBSM, we gon shake somethin'
Potato on the barrel, watch me bake somethin'

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah I'm a hater, fuck your wrist
Yeah I'm a hater, fuck your life
Yeah I'm a hater, nigga fuck your money
Fuck your car nigga, fuck your clique
Yeah I'm a hater, fuck your wrist
Yeah I'm a hater, nigga fuck your car
Yeah I'm a hater, nigga fuck your money
Nigga fuck your life, fuck your clique, squad
