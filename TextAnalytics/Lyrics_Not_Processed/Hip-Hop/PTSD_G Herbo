[Intro]
D.A. got that—
D.A. got that dope

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I prove you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war zone on inside of my head
I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead
I've seen my brothers fall over and over again
Don't stand too close to me, I got PTSD

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
I was hearing bangs like Chief Keef
Always yelling names that's deceased
I go off my mind and my instinct (And my instinct)
Shootin' at the same time, we was in sync
On the same thing, tryna repeat (Repeat)
We was in them whips, right back on the enemies
Stuffed on my last hit, I was in the middle seat
Fuck it, out the sun roof, brodie got a quick release
And we in a car real fast from police
Shots fired back, but his ass in the street
When I bought a forty, showed Brittany and Tiffany
Knowing if they call, it ain't shit they can't get from me
Lot of warfare, 17, had a 50 piece
Flexed on niggas so you know they wanna kill a G
(Royalty) Posted in the hood with some Bentley keys
(Loyalty) Roc died, showed 'em what it really mean
I can't sleep 'cause it's a war zone in my head
My killers good, they know I'm hands-on with the bread
A million dollars ahead, I'm still angry and seeing red
How the fuck I'm 'posed to have fun? All my niggas dead

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & 
Chance The Rapper
]
I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I prove you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war zone on inside of my head
I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead
I've seen my brothers fall over and over again (
Hunh
)
Don't stand too close to me (
Igh
), I got PTSD

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Used to run home from the train stop (Yeah)
Running so fast, dodging raindrops
'Member got robbed at the park once (Yeah)
'Member thinking that that bitch probably ain't cocked (Yeah)
'Member I was with my mama one time
Seen a nigga through the glass, hit a nigga with a bankshot (Bow)
Point-blank, head hanging off his tank top (Woo)
Walked off, we drove off, went to GameStop (Skrrt)
Quiet ride there, picked up 
San Andreas
 (Hunh)
Certain things we ain't talk about, mama, we just prayed off
We seen it all, don't get involved
Carry the weight of the world like a shawl (Yeah)
Conceal and revealing to people in court
I still can feel it, I know that the world is evil, in case you thought a nigga forgot it
When my homie was bleeding out, another homie went in his pockets (Tsk)
Please do not run up on me, not even as fans
Niggas get fanned down on the Dan Ryan
I'm flying, I'm scary as hell, I need me a Xan (Igh)

[Bridge: Juice WRLD & 
Lil Uzi Vert
]
The days seem longer as life gets shorter
We know sex, drugs, money, all in that order
Ain't no structure, no peace, we've lost our order
Leaving me with anxiety, fucking up my sobriety
 (
Lil Uzi Vert, yeah
)

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
It's a war zone laying inside my head
I still think about all my niggas that's dead
I'm too paranoid, yeah, I know you heard what I said
I'm too paranoid, I make sure all my opps, they bled (Woah)
Draining all my energy, no, I cannot sleep, uh-huh
I'm affected by the streets, no appetite, I can't eat
I only see red when I see, I think it's my PTSD (Damn)
I think it's my PTSD (Woah), I think it's my PTSD, yeah (Woah)
