[Intro]
30, you a fool for this one (Cheeze)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Gucci flip-flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock
Pull the six out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to they pussy ass, turn this shit up a notch
Gucci flip-flops (Fuck it), make her kick rocks (Bust it)
This a big clock, check the wristwatch (Check it)
Gucci flip-flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (Bust it)
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock (Off of the clock)

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
Bhad Bhabie got these bitches bustin' for cash (For cash)
Do the dash, try to play me, bitch, I'm bustin' your ass (Bustin' your)
Lotta gun sounds, Rollie bust down
Know why these bitches mad? 'Cause they trash and they fuckin' for cash (Cash)
Too official, blow the whistle, bitch, I'm fly as a bird (Brr)
Take a picture, get your issue, bitch'll die on my word (My word)
Walk in the bank, fuck it up, pokin' that bitch with a shank, fuck it up (Fuck it up)
I bought the lil' bitch a bag, make it double back and clear up her tab (Yeah)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie & Lil Yachty]
Gucci flip-flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock
Pull the six out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to they pussy ass, turn this shit up a notch
Gucci flip-flops (Fuck it), make her kick rocks (Bust it)
This a big clock, check the wristwatch (Check it)
Gucci flip-flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (Bust it)
This a big watch (Lil Boat), diamonds drippin' off of the clock (Off of the clock)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I got big guap, pussy, yeah, I'm real rich (Yeah)
Six cars, two houses, and I'm still rich, uh (Uh)
Think it's sweet? One call, hit the kill-switch (Boom)
Boy, be cool, I ain't worried 'bout your lil' bitch, nigga
That lil' chain that you rockin', that's so little to me
Talkin' shit, but want a verse? That's a riddle to me
Can't fuck the bitch if she got her virginity (Hoo, yeah)
'Cause then she gon' really be into me (Hoo, yeah)
.223 shells in my ride for the enemies (Uh)
Put a few holes in his kidney (Hoo, Lil Boat)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
Gucci flip-flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock
Pull the six out, wintertime, droppin' the top
Give it to they pussy ass, turn this shit up a notch
Gucci flip-flops (Fuck it), make her kick rocks (Bust it)
This a big clock, check the wristwatch (Check it)
Gucci flip-flops, fuck it, hit your bitch in my socks (Bust it)
This a big watch, diamonds drippin' off of the clock (Off of the clock)
