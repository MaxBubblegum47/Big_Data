Lyrics from Snippet

Girl, I can't play it, I'm tryin'
Now you're beggin' me for my time
Now you want my attention
Don't know your intentions
You don't seem to get it and I don't think that you are the world
Start thinkin' 'bout life, now I'm wearin' Prada
And I'm almost dyin'
Is it even worth tryin'

We put up a fight
But I gotta say goodbye
And baby, it doesn't have to be
Baby, it doesn't have to be
Do it to my life
Can you do it to my life?
Baby, it doesn't have to be
I know when I gotta go, now
