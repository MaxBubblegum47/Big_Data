[Verse 1]
My life, screw it with a drunk bitch
Like what the fuck are we doin'
We kissin', I'm weezing, it's time to play Tetris
I play piano, jack off I'm anorexic
I'm fucking asthmatic, my records problematic
Talkin' to myself because my therapist done had it
All the racial slurs from the wangsters playin' from Lenny Kravitz
Love Lockdown like I am some sort of faggot
But I'm not in the first place
Waiting on my dad to say hi on my birthday
Cause Jesus wouldn't even be my friend on Church day
I plan on getting back *censored* the worst way
In the jungle, I planned on the keeper
Inside of the cage cause I'm a motherfuckin' Zebra
Obama's in office, niggas get job like teachers
Lookin' out, retarded kids screamin' out fuck slob, Jesus

[Refrain: Casey Veggies]
And I can write a hook fast
I can get straight to the cash
Y'all niggas come last, I'm first though
No rehearsal, I know it all like Urkel
You can call it commercial
So turn it up, turn it up
Odd Future won't stop it

[Verse 2]
I make music for a reason, didn't vote Obama
So you can charge me with treason
Year round asshole, the fuck you season
The flu, I'm sick that's why everybody sneezin'
I'm always cheesin', smile for a reason
Fuck as I fuck you, I'm always teasin'
My daughter need milk and a quilt
So I'm sellin' the the haze for six bucks cause she always sneezin'
Some people need drugs, some people need dubs
On they car note to go to the club
But really, really, really, all I need deep down is a hug

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Look, I'm back like niggas on a bus
With a Rosa Parks state of mind, I don't give a fuck
And I'm strollin' Down South like Good Luck Chuck
In a Malcolm X shirt chillin' with the Ku Klux
Klan, I ain't nothin' to fuck with
O.F. clan they ain't nothin' to fuck with
The O.F. clan they ain't nothin' to fuck with
This Black Snake Moan is somethin' to suck bitch
