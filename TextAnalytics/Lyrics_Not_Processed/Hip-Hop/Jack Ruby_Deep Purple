[Verse]
There's no method in my madness, no craft, no guile
No expertise, no self assuring smile
No wizardry or witchcraft, no crass deceit
No dark conspiracies, I stand on my own two feet
I'm coming through just like Jack Ruby
I ragged around the edges but I got control
There's no way around it and I got control
I reach out for my program, still got control
Straight down to business, who needs control
I've got panache just like Jack Ruby
I don't beg forgiveness, I don't beg at all
But I beg to differ cos I got the ball
There was no invitation, you're not my type
And what's gone, it ain't worth having, kiss it all
Goodbye
Right on the money just like Jack Ruby
