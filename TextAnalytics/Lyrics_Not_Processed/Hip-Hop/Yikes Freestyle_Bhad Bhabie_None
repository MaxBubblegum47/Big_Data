[Intro]
Dices on the beat

[Verse]
Little me
Got these bitches big press
Little bitch just saw a big mess
I had you big stress
How he get a hold of me?
Guess you could say he big bless
See to get a hold of me, you need to have big checks
Big checks
Big house
Fast cars
Real big rep
Yeah that big flex
You hoes ain't nothing like me
See I'm the wifey
Gave this hoe a little fame, she started acting sheisty
Put a lil' bitch on and had her acting like me
Put up one little post to make y'all wanna fight me
Thinking I ain't on shit
Lil' bitch I might be
I might be, yeah, bitch I might be
