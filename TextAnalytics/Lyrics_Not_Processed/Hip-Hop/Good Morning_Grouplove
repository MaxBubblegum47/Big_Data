[Verse 1]
Live wide awake, yeah
Am I a stranger
Just all alone
Addicted to my other self
I'll re-arrange ya'
I'll out of place ya'
Where everybody's something else
And I can't tell

[Pre-Chorus]
From the black to the blue
To black, black, you like that?
Call on the cat cause the cat dragged in
I caught the rat
The rat, rat, the rat trap
All I know

[Pre-Chorus]
From the black to the blue
To black, black, you like that?
Call on the cat cause the cat dragged in
I caught the rat
The rat, rat, ya' like that?
All I know

[Chorus]
The night is young, the rest is up to you
Why ya' gotta say, "good morning"
Why ya' gotta say, "good morning"
Why ya' gotta say
The night is young, the rest is up to you
Why ya' gotta say, "good morning"
Why ya' gotta say, "good morning"
Why ya' gotta say
The night is young, the rest is up to you

[Verse 2]
Tonight I'm singing
I've got the feeling
The clock is moving
Moving till I lose control
Get now, I'm leaving
My ears are ringing
My body screaming
This is unbelievable

[Pre-Chorus]
From the black to the blue
To black, black, you like that?
Call on the cat cause the cat dragged in
I caught the rat
The rat, rat, the rat trap?
All I know

[Pre-Chorus]
From the black to the blue
To black, black, you like that?
Call on the cat cause the cat dragged in
I caught the rat
The rat, rat, ya' like that?
All I know

[Chorus]
The night is young, the rest is up to you
Why ya' gotta say, "good morning"
Why ya' gotta say, "good morning"
Why ya' gotta say
The night is young, the rest is up to you
Why ya' gotta say, "good morning"
Why ya' gotta say, "good morning"
Why ya' gotta say
The night is young, the rest is up to you

[Pre-Chorus]
From the black to the blue
To black, black, you like that?
Call on the cat cause the cat dragged in
I caught the rat
The rat, rat, the rat trap
All I know

[Pre-Chorus]
From the black to the blue
To black, black, you like that?
Call on the cat cause the cat dragged in
I caught the rat
The rat, rat, ya' like that?
All I know

[Pre-Chorus]
From the black to the blue
To black, black, you like that?
Call on the cat cause the cat dragged in
I caught the rat
The rat, rat, ya' like that?
All I know

[Chorus]
The night is young, the rest is up to you
The night is young, the rest is up to you
Why ya' gotta say so?
Why ya' gotta say, why ya' gotta say?
Why ya' gotta say so?
