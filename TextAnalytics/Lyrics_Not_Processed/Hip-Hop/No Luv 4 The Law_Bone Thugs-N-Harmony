[Intro]
If you can accept it, you will leave those state troopers gluttered with their own barbarity
If you can accept it, you will do something that will transform conditions here
So I'm not worried this afternoon
However dark it may be
However difficult it may be
I know that it is true
The truth forever on the scaffold
Wrong forever on the throne

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
I been tryna to gather my niggas for battle
We outta control, we can't be handled
We sick of police and they scandals
Forty-four magnums, bustin' it random at 'em
In the middle of the chaos, I'ma be bustin' my shit at the mayor
If you get caught up with nothin' to save ya, gauges spray and break ya down no where
In front of the pack and I'm orderin' niggas to point it and shoot it
If it ain't black owned then we loot it
Burn this bitch, let's do it
We ain't marchin', we ain't talkin'
We keepin' our eye on the target
So as soon as the shit get started, we gon' pop-pop-pop-pop that body
Them po-po don't want beef, they want this war out on the streets with me and my T-H-U-Gs
Bitch, you freeze
You under arrest and you got the right to die
And guess who's pullin' the switch? And I can't wait to see you fry

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs

[Interlude]
Today, it's time to stop singin' and start swingin'
You can't sing up on freedom, but you can swing up on some freedom

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
I never did have no love for the system
Man, them laws ain't built to protect me
I'm just a nigga tryna live the American dream
But you wanna arrest me and for what?
Because I'm shinin', blingin'?
Mad because I rhyme and sing?
Got too much money, got too many guns?
Your pitiful life ain't got no meanin'
And I know you steamin'
L-Burna done got legit now
Bitch, you sit on the ground, you get on the ground
You ain't talkin' that shit now
Wanna spit rounds?
You know the cop'll bring the regime and helicopters
Strapped with TECs and nines, for what's in the sky, I got a grenade launcher
Ain't nothin' to do today, so what I'ma do?
I'ma bust on the cops
Shoot the street light out on the block, dial 9-1-1 sit back and watch
I can hear them sirens comin'
I'ma teach these foo's not to fuck with me
And the outcome was a catastrophe
Do this once a week until my brother's free

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
United we stand, divided we fall for the same bullshit like snipers on White House lawns
On that good shit
Niggas from Compton to Africa on that thug shit
Reginald Denny, no comment
I lost my blood with the gat that Carlos gave us, Lord
I can't love shit as the fullest extent is given
I'm above these deceptions, I know they intentions
With swords made by Smith & Wesson
Pulla me weapon, embrace in the Lord
Feel the spiritual resurrection through my pores
On the souls of the allies of war
No college scholarships, just calibers and clips
On the block warriors plottin' on kingpin licks
Flip burgers, I just can't see it
We gon' face more green with Bone Thugs in one night, no secret
Fuck the Feds, it ain't no love at all for 'em
They pull me over with police dogs lickin' my scrotum

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
Since a young thug, couldn't tell me nothin'
Ya fuck up, I shed blood, gotta leave this world with somethin'
A realer nigga, no more than I can handle
The drugs was at [?] a Mac, got caught up in a scandal
Police ain't right and we ain't either
Everybody want somethin' equal
Listen up my people
We gotta get down, get down for right now
Nigga, fuck your beeper
And this is how we are
Our dream to get paid
Gotta think he's one of a kind, he's better than everybody, destroyin' dreams
But don't you listen, we can rise above it, above it
Nine times outta ten, nah, fuck that, 'cause they gon' love it
Quit fuckin' wit' my people
Wonder why we react
We strong, need to be left alone (Yeah) and that's a fact

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
