[Intro]
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
I found you
Girl, I like being around you
Feel like Kanye, I'm Bound 2
Shawty, if you down, I'm down too
Yeah, I found you
Girl, I like being around you
Feel like Kanye, I'm Bound 2
Shawty, if you down, I'm down too

[Verse]
High class, shawty so bad
Hella swag, she got all these bitches mad
She the type of girl a nigga wish he had
She the type that if you get her, you can brag
Little shawty got her own and I like that
Hit the mall, she ain't worried 'bout a price tag
She got all these niggas out here tryna wife that
And a lil' nigga tryna pipe that
She can get whatever she want
She can get that new Saint Laurent
I could put that Rollie on her arm
And I can get the bracelet with the charm

[Chorus]
I found you
Girl, I like being around you
Feel like Kanye, I'm Bound 2
Shawty, if you down, I'm down too
Yeah, I found you
Girl, I like being around you
Feel like Kanye, I'm Bound 2
Shawty, if you down, I'm down too

[Bridge]
You are unforgettable
And I'm so glad that I found you
And you are unforgettable
And I'm so glad that I found you

[Chorus]
I found you
Girl, I like being around you
Feel like Kanye, I'm Bound 2
Shawty, if you down, I'm down too
Yeah, I found you
Girl, I like being around you
Feel like Kanye, I'm Bound 2
Shawty, if you down, I'm down too
