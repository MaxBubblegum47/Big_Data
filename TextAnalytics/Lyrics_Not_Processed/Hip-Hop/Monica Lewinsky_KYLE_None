[Intro: Bill Clinton]
I did not have sexual relations with that woman
Ms. Lewinsky

[Hook G-Eazy & Kyle]
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinskey
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinsky
It’ll make her work
Monica, Monica Lewinsky
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Monica, Monica Lewinsky
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Monica, Monica Lewinsky
(That’s Monica Lewinsky)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Uh, and everyone's like “No, no G why'd you rap on that shit?
And make a dumb song about acting ratchet
Flip another 50's song, that’s a classic
Endless Summer, please go back to that shit"
Ain’t shit changed, got the facts to back it
Uh huh, and I don’t give a fuck if the truth be told
‘Cause I been doing drugs with these groupie hoes
Drunk listening to Gucci throwed
Last night, yeah, I found a slut
Who appeared to be the type to be down to cut
She took another shot and said “turn down for what?”
Like “I don’t know, fuck, you look like you might throw up”
Silly hoes party so much these days
The Monica Lewinsky’s who give the BJ’s
I really like your friend, call her up for three ways
This songs full of all the clichés
Bulleit Bourbon, I pull up swervin’
I’m the waviest, I might pull up surfing
I’m waking up, I’m hungover as fuck
I make the girl get out, but first pull the curtain
Off a thizzle throw a party, all these bitches sniffle
Neighbors bugging saying ‘‘please just try to keep it civil!’’

[Hook G-Eazy & Kyle]
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinskey
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinsky
It’ll make her work
Monica, Monica Lewinsky
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Monica, Monica Lewinsky
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Monica, Monica Lewinsky
(That’s Monica Lewinsky)

[Verse 2: Skizzy Mars]
We brought weed, we brought bars
Said “bring friends”, she was cool with that
The homie brought the whip, I hopped in front, there’s two in back
Artsy girls, they just want to go to school and act
She gon’ run and tell her friends that Skizzy Mars is cool as shit
Rapper stereotypes, but what if it happens like every night?
I pull out my phone and I barely can type
Mix the liquor, the pills and it rarely goes right, I’m like
Look where we started, we used to get carded
Two-stepping models at 1 Oak and Darby
Blues by the curtain, the life of the party
She a big fan, got my mixtape on her laptop
Cigarettes and Henn, the city is our backdrop
Her and all her friends, Instagramming, taking Snapshots
I got the whiskey, got the weed, hit the jackpot

[Hook G-Eazy & Kyle]
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinskey
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Molly and that Whiskey
That’s Monica Lewinsky
It’ll make her work
Monica, Monica Lewinsky
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Monica, Monica Lewinsky
That’s Monica Lewinsky
Monica, Monica Lewinsky
(That’s Monica Lewinsky)

[Outro]
It'll make her work (work), work (work)
Twerk (twerk), twerk (twerk)
Squirt (squirt), squirt (squirt)
That's Monica Lewinsky
It'll make her work (work), work (work)
Twerk (twerk), twerk (twerk)
Squirt (squirt), squirt (squirt)
That's Monica Lewinsky
Molly and that Whiskey
That's Monica Lewinsky
