[Chorus: Swae Lee]
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, nah, I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't wanna roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up, comin' out her clothes (Clothes)
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Diamonds unthawed, comin' in froze (Froze)
Got too many girls to let one of them go (Oh)
When I make a purchase, I can't wait to show-ow-boat (Oh)
If she bad, I put a pinky ring on, snow globe
I'ma have that pussy on lock like po-po (Yeah)
She was goin' up and down like yo-yo (Down)
You can say I'm greedy 'cause I always want more (More)
I don't fuck with holmes 'cause they with some slow-pokes (Lame)
Ooh, money on monsoon (Ooh), baby girl, full moon (Ayy)
Give these niggas with some money some room
She don't stop, batteries not included (Go)
Oh, big ballin' like Mutombo
 ('Tombo), yeah
Much cooler than the cool kids, woah
Can you believe every night we do this? (Do this), yeah

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, nah, I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't wanna roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up, comin' out her clothes (Clothes)
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Hold up, I'ma go and spend those hundreds though (Hol' up)
I don't care if she had a man, so? (Man?)
Pedicure gang, get your fingernails dipped
With no shame, flips that ass like heads or tails (Tails)
And she finer than a motherlover (Lover)
Can I hit that ass like a bullseye? (Hit)
She gon' suck like a bloodsucker (Woo)
My feet higher than a motherfucker
Oh, I hear you like fast cash (Fast cash)
Baby, you know I got the hots for you (I've got the hots)
I've been workin', so I cash in
She said, "I only wanna dance for you" (Dance)
We have no mercy for you, no (No)
Me and my niggas closer than in-laws (Than in-laws)
Fuck an interview, she know the answer (Answer)
Prototype cars, not a Jaguar

[Chorus: Swae Lee & 
Slim Jxmmi

(Skrrt) 
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, nah, I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't wanna roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up, comin' out her clothes (Clothes)
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine (
Yeah, ayy

Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign (
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy
)

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
Duck sauce on my feet, ho
, pass around the pre-rolls
Rollie on my chain, Flavor Flav with the steez, ho
Kush residue on my jeans, I blow hella dope
And them classic Reeboks, whiter than snow
And a nigga be dressin', walkin' 'round, Gucci steppin'
Unintentional flexin', tryna send out a message
Money walk with the extra, shake that ass wit' ya bestie
Seein' stars in the rental, got your broad in the rental
20K in A.O.D. and it's just me and my kinfolk
Tryna send a girl to college, I ain't coppin' no free show
Say her birthday late July, yeah, that means she a Leo
Might just leave with me tonight, but that don't mean she a freak ho
Fuck with dancers and models, shout out them girls who get dollars
Shawty came from the bottom, yeah, shout out Keisha Bottoms
Couple cases of Rosé, came out to me with the sparklers
I pour up for all the girls, but I'ma drink out the bottles

[Chorus: Swae Lee & 
Juicy J

(Skrrt) 
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up, nah, I ain't hostin'
Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't wanna roll it
I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide
Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up (
Yeah
), comin' out her clothes (
Uh

I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
 (
Yeah
)
And I don't care if she take all of mine (
I got you man
)
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign (
Juicy J
)

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
She got that million dollar pussy, but I get it for the free
She like to do a lot of snow, I told that bitch to come and ski
Shawty bad, she can get it, she can swallow, she can spit it
Bring her friend, if she with it, on the pole, y'all can split it
In the bed or the Lamb' (Or the Lamb')
Got your bitch suckin' dick on the 'Gram (On the 'Gram)
V12 helped me get up out the jam (out the jam), trunk full of slam
R.I.P. Lil Peep, I gotta slow down on them Xans (Hey)
Just had a ménage (Hey), back seat of my 
Benz
 (Hey)
Put that shit on camera (Hey), she squirted on the lens (Hey)
Then she told me put it on her chinny chin-chin (Hey)
Pocket full of nothin' but them Benjy Franklins
In the game, posted up (Up), puttin' numbers up (Up)
Bitch, run me that check first, I don't wanna fuck (Yeah)
They say it's cuffin' season, baby, you ain't good enough (Nope)
She want a real nigga, dawg, you ain't hood enough

[Chorus: Swae Lee & 
Juicy J

(Skrrt) 
What's in ya' mug? Toasted up (
Yeah

Kush all in my lap because these hoes don't wanna roll it

I was slidin' in the Lamb' with the powerglide (
Ayy

Slime green paint, peanut butter inside
She wanna fuck, speak up, comin' out her clothes (Clothes)
I'm in wonderland when she comin' down the pole
And I don't care if she take all of mine
Like it ain't shit but a dollar sign
