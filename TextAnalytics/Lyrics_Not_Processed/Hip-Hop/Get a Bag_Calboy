[Intro: Chance The Rapper & James Taylor]
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
Uh-huh
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
Yup, yup, yup
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
Let me tell you somethin'

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & James Taylor]
You want a bag, you get a bag
You need a bag, you get a bag
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
You want a bag, you get a bag (A bag)
You need a bag, you get a bag (Bag)
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
You need a bag
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
You need a, you need a, you need a bag
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
You need a, you need a, you need a, need a

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Ayy, ayy, I pull up in that Elon, all these niggas felines
I stopped smokin' cigarettes, now pussy taste like key lime
Big ol' Birkin bag she could lean on like a crutch
She said, "Babe, if it's too crazy, that .380 in my clutch"
I say, "Yop, you know you my favorite shooter"
Yop, bing-bing-bang-booka-booka
Yop, we gon' keep it out of court
We run plays, this shit a sport
We some G's, we don't want want pork
We go crazy, make it work, work, work
Shorty way too bad, she want a bag and not no purse
Screamin', "Fuck the other grass"
She want that gas and not that dirt
She want that cash and I'm like Turk
I want that cash, and she like work, work, work

[Pre-Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
I'm just tryna get to it in a new way
With the band on a beeper or the two-way
We could get on the Venmo, what's to it?
We could run just together, what's to it?

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
When you want a bag, you get a bag
You need a bag, you get a bag
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh (Go get it, go get it, go get it)
You want a bag, you get a bag (A bag)
You need a bag, you get a bag (Bag)
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh (Go get it, go get it, go get it)
You need a bag

[Verse 2: CalBoy]
I know I gotta get this money 'til my dyin' soul
By the low, I come from the trenches, we was by the store
Baby, no, I don't wanna buy your love, but my heart is cold
Gotta roll, all my homies old and I keep 'em close
Lucid dream, ridin' that hemi thing, swear I do the most
Brand new fiend, she drink anything, she might need a Coke
Never sleep, gotta get to this bag, I ain't goin' broke
Wanna kick it with me, but I ain't got no legs, I been on the go
I don't go with no plan, better stick with your plan
Did you hear what I said? I don't know what you sayin'
And you know I'm the man, let's get to the deads
Let's get to some bread, better hop out in your bag

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
When you want a bag, you get a bag
You need a bag, you get a bag
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh (Go get it, go get it, go get it)
You want a bag, you get a bag (A bag)
You need a bag, you get a bag (Bag)
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh (Go get it, go get it, go get it)

[Outro: James Taylor]
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
(Oh, tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)
