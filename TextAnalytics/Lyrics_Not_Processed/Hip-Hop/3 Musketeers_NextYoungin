Haha, ayy, ayy
Tell lil' shorty, "Come here" (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Trap Bunnie Bubbles

[Verse 1: ppcocaine]
Bitch, I still get checks from my ex
You thinkin' that she yours but she movin' to the next (The next)
No bitch can compare, they all think I'm the best (Fuckin' right)
Real witch bitch, put yo' ass in a hex (Voodoo)
Bitch, I got big stack, big flex (Big flex)
Baby call my phone, tryna blow her tax check
Call me a nympho 'cause I like good sex (Oh)
But don't be mad when you going through my texts

[Chorus: ppcocaine]
Ayy, ayy, tell lil' shorty come here (Come here)
I'm tryna blow her back out, walking funny for the year (Wobble, wobble)
Tell me that you want me, that's the shit I always hear
I got three bitches on me like the three musketeers
Ayy, ayy (Musketeers), tell lil' shorty come here (Come here)
I'm tryna blow her back out, walking funny for the year (Wobble, wobble)
Tell me that you want me, that's the shit I always hear (Always hear it)

[Verse 2: ppcocaine]
Bitch, shake that ass or kick rocks (Kick rocks)
Fuck a situationship, I'm tryna see that box
Saw her on her Tinder, said she like long walks (On the beach)
Runnin' with my phone but bitch who got these locks?
Dumb ho, who bought this motherfuckin' phone?
Yeah, shorty love it 'cause I'm making her moan
Try to find another bitch, get hit in the dome
Yeah, I know I am a queen 'cause I'm sitting on the throne

[Chorus: ppcocaine]
Ayy, ayy, tell lil' shorty come here (Come here)
I'm tryna blow her back out, walking funny for the year (Wobble, wobble)
Tell me that you want me, that's the shit I always hear (Always hear it)
I got three bitches on me like the three musketeers
Ayy, ayy (Musketeers), tell lil' shorty come here (Come here)

Tell me that you want me, that's the shit I always hear (Always hear it)
I got three bitches on me like the three musketeers

[Verse 3: NextYoungin]
Hey, gang, NextYoungin
It's Daddy Kaine in this bitch (Ayy)
Pull up to the function and she tryna get lit
Shorty talkin' foreign, yeah, I'm thinking she a Brit
Never stay strapped 'cause my brothers with the shit
Keep talking money 'til they hit you with a lick (Baow)
All yo' shit fake but there's Gucci on my fit
She want bread for the head but no, I'm not a trick (Nah)
Switchin' up the roles, charge a rack for the flick
Keeping dirty money but my hands still clean (Yup)
Bitch is high tech, yeah, I think she off the lean
Don't try to kiss me, ho, you need some Listerine
Drown in this money, all you see on me is green
I bought her a Perc' and I bought her a bean
Now she blowin' up my phone so I know that she a fiend
Got her in her feelings, tell her bestie that I'm mean
No, I never need no hoes, I just pass 'em to the team

[Chorus: NextYoungin & ppcocaine]
Ayy, ayy, tell lil' shorty come here (Come here)
I'm tryna blow her back out, walking funny for the year (Walking funny)
Tell me that you want me, that's the shit I always hear (Ha)
I got three bitches on me like the three musketeers
Ayy, ayy, tell lil' shorty come here (Come here)
I'm tryna blow her back out, walking funny for the year (Wobble, wobble)
Tell me that you want me, that's the shit I always hear
I got three bitches on me like the three musketeers (Musketeers)

[Outro: ppcocaine & NextYoungin]
Oh

Hell yeah

Hmm, three musketeers

Yeah, Daddy Kaine and Cocaine, huh!
