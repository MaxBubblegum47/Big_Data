[Intro]
Okay, okay, alright, huh
Oh, mmm, okay, haha
Nigga dropped his phone
Woah, Kenny

[Verse 1]
Uh, okay, baby, be callin' me Hercules
'Cause the H on my waist, but this bitch here stand for Hermes
O-o-okay, I done popped me a perky
'Cause I heard it help with the pain, but just help my backaches
Okay, uh, baby, don't hurt me
Let's begin after three 'cause a nigga like foreplay
Uh, uh, uh, uh, okay
Drippin' like I just took a shit and clogged toilet
Captain Long John Silver, I'm gonna reel 'em in
Got on goat fur cream color coat from Burberry's Den
I'm a monster with a nice watch on, name not Ben 10
I'ma go get everything Mother Earth transcends

[Chorus]
Skrrrt, uh, uh, drop it on my cock
Skrrrt, I'ma h-hot nigga, no pot
Skrrrt, niggas still gettin' buns, hot dogs
Skrrrt, niggas not fuckin' with ya, coleslaw

[Verse 2]
Please take shelter, spit it like a pronounced letter
Beat too hard, sir
Spoonin' yo' bitch like I just pulled out a yogurt
Three bitches three different colors, Powerpuff girls, sir
What's the word? (Yerr)
She gotta go through him just to get to me, yes, I'm the middleman
Pokin' a bitch, she chokin' a bitch, she blowin' like a ceilin' fan
Pussy color on that bitch remind me of jacket on the Killa Cam
Ma'am I'm makin' green eggs and ham, bitch you know I am

[Chorus]
Skrrrt, uh, uh, drop it on my cock
Skrrrt, I'ma h-hot nigga, no pot
Skrrrt, niggas still gettin' buns, hot dogs
Skrrrt, niggas not fuckin' with ya, coleslaw

[Verse 3]
Woke up to a good life, baby
Gettin' chicken bitch, you know I'm gravy
Watchin' me, what you see? Diamonds HD
Shinin' brighter than the smile on my auntie
Hawaiian punch a nigga that be tryna play me
Hol' up I just pull up in a new Mercedes
