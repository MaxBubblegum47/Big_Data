[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
I'm loyal to the soil
I'd die for mine, what would you do?
I made an oath, then bonded in blood
Beast Coasta Nostra

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Everybody saying I'm a dead man (Dead man)
This right here's a confession, I
Never showed love with my left hand (Left hand)
Never really fucked with no yes-men, I
Think LSD be my best friend
Dick so big, use it as a kickstand
Rarely ever leave the house without my weapon
If you hatin', plot from a distance, die

[Verse 1: Nyck Caution & 
Meechy Darko
]
Everybody sayin' that I'm reckless (Reckless)
I ain't evil but I got some bad intentions, I
Never showed love with my left hand
If you, if you my brother, you don't even gotta question, I
Never was the one to show expression (Yeah)
Do 'em dirty like it's nothin', I'ma deadpan (Deadpan)
With the Zombies, think I got too many dead friends (Dead friends)
Name another crew that we less than, I

[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
Stay above the clouds, I don't get fly
Got the TEC, I stay connected like it's Best Buy
Could have been a Flatbush Zombie 'cause I'm dead nice
If you dap me with your left hand, something ain't right
Because I don't got no time for the fake shit
Niggas funny, start just watchin' when they shapeshift
Shit be blurry when you look at it through they lens
When you think about it, it don't ever make sense (Fly)

[Verse 3: Erick the Architect]
Read the bad vibe when I stepped in (Sheesh)
Never been scared to make suggestions, I
Dressed in all black like the best man (Flee)
Never was a fan of no yes-men, I (No)
Keep my composure with bredren (Brrt)
Until I'm draped in fabric like a reverend (Flee)
So don't feed me no excuses, I'm ahead of them (No)
Yeah, they jealous 'cause they cannot do it better than I

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Everybody saying I'm a dead man (Dead man)
This right here's a confession, I
Never show love with my left hand (Left hand)
Never really fuck with no yes-men, I
Think LSD be my best friend
Dick so big, use it as a kickstand
Rarely ever leave the house without my weapon
If you hatin' plot from a distance, die

[Verse 4: Zombie Juice]
Might go around heads like a headband
Big ball, big dog, dead man
Which one of y'all wanna blow down?
Smoke big blunts, size of my dick, ow
It's the fireman, light up here, diamonds shine, I appear
Poodle in my lap, whole Beast clique right here
I'm Jesse on the track, Owens on the mat
All I know is facts, facts, and more facts

[Verse 5: AKTHESAVIOR]
Uh, back to back, we gon' snap
Pass your ho 'round, assist, now check stats
Fuck a pat-down, the grip up in the stash
Shots, a man down, my thirds they never lack
Uh, real G's get money, lay low
Keep a couple shooters, lawyers, payroll, I
Mold your bitch like Play-Doh
Now she specialize in head like Kangol, I

[Verse 6: Kirk Knight]
Lookin' my way, that's a dead end
'Fit same cost as your pension
See my battle scars, Rurouni Kenshin
Gotta trust my gut so I flex it
God-God's at the wheel, like my license suspended (Skrrt)
Coast like the ocean, you drown any second
And fuck your protection, anybody can...

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Everybody saying I'm a dead man (Dead man)
This right here's a confession, I
Never showed love with my left hand (Left hand)
Never really fucked with no yes-men, I
Think LSD be my best friend
Dick so big, use it as a kickstand
Rarely ever leave the house without my weapon
If you hatin' plot from a distance, die

[Bridge: Meechy Darko]
The police told me I don't give a fuck
My homies told me I don't give a fuck
The OG's told me I don't give a fuck
Yeah, I don't give a fuck, yeah, I don't give a fuck
The government told me I don't give a fuck
The media told me I don't give a fuck
The president told me I don't give a fuck
Yeah, I don't give a fuck, yeah, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 7: Joey Bada$$]
Takin' shots of the Bulleit, got me dead bent
Finger on the trigger, pull it, you a dead man
Not close, need to understand distance
Beast Coast takin' over, it was destined, I
Ain't gotta tell these niggas I'm a legend
Niggas sleep, I ain't even into resting
Couple dead presidents in my left hand
Niggas don't want war with the Badmon, Badmon

[Verse 8: Issa Gold]
Step through, nigga be feelin' like James Bond
Enemies buckin' softer than cotton and creamed corn
Hennessy fill my liver, been drinking a liter
On a killing spree, knocking back thotties like ping pong
Niggas Diddy Kong, follow a leader with weak hearts
Singing silly songs, giving no effort, I leak sauce
Hope you live long, praying for niggas that hate strong
Never hate on, giving out love like Faizon

[Outro: Meechy Darko]
Everybody saying I'm a dead man, I
Never show love with my left hand, I
Everybody saying I'm a dead man, I
Never show love with my left hand
