[Verse 1]
I can't live another life
Spend another time
I can't spit another rhyme on Gaia
Guns and wars won't stop the fights
Not inside your mind
Love and communion, there's nothing better
Cheeks get redder
There's nothing better
Even in rough weather
It's raining knives, like all the time
And I'm alive, Irayo Eywa, we're alive

[Chorus]
Marceline, I'm coming to get you, girl
We're flying so high, catch a ride on Lady Unicorn
Marceline, I know you're not real in this dimension, I mean

[Verse 2]
What's up with your dad up in the nightosphere?
Your tears, they're cleansing all my spheres
You touch my hair, I'm playing on your bass
But we don't care, we're messing up your space
You got nowhere to live
, but you'll go back to space
Huh... take me with you
I'm sick of mildew
I'm sick of all of these humans telling me what to do
They make you stupid, but we are from Nibiru
Remember your cosmic roots

[Chorus]
Marceline, I'm coming to get you, girl
We're flying so high, let's catch a ride on Lady Unicorn
Marceline, Marceline
Marceline, you're breathing in gasoline
