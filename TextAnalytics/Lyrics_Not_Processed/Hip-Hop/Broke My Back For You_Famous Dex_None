[Bridge 1: Dee]
How could you play me
How could you play me baby
You did me shady
You did me shady baby
All the options that I had, I just wanted love
I can't keep letting you play me, I had enough

[Chorus: Dee]
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you

[Verse 1: Famous Dex]
I broke my back for you
Look what you made me do
I hope this shit ain't true
This shit done made the news
You used to be my boo
Now you going fool
I hope this shit ain't true
What I am gonna do? Woah
Diamonds they right in my neck
Young nigga know how to flex
All these bitches want sex
Baby girl tryna stress, me
Woah, and they ain't wanna do
Yeah, I put my heart out for you
And they wasn't comfortable
I'm poppin' pills and now I'm not comfortable
Yeah, wait, she used to be my boo
And now she going fool

[Chorus: Dee]
I broke my back for you

[Verse 2: Dee]
Either way that Dee want it
Still winnin' my way
Just to make your day
Put a smile in your face
Either way that Dee wanna
Wanna give you my love
Wanna give you my trust
Spend all of my dubs
How could you play me
How could you play me baby
You did me shady
You did me shady baby
All the options that I had, I just wanted love
I can't keep letting you play me, I had enough
Shoulda known you was gonna change like a fake necklace
Now I don't want nothing to do with you I hope you get it
Cuz...

[Chorus: Dee]
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
I broke my back for you
