[Verse]
Sleepless nights at the Chateau
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do
Kush kush, wherever we go
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do
To get a wildfire burning
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do
Ace high, I'm going all in
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do

[Chorus]
Spread it like peanut butter jelly
Do it like I owe you some money
Spread it like peanut butter jelly
Do it like I owe you some money
Money, money, money, money…

[Post-Chorus/Breakdown]
Spread it like...
Spread it like...
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do
Spread it like...

[Verse]
Sleepless nights at the Chateau
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do
Kush kush, wherever we go
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do
To get a wildfire burning
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do
Ace high, I'm going all in
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do

[Chorus]
Spread it like peanut butter jelly
Do it like I owe you some money
Spread it like peanut butter jelly
Do it like I owe you some money
Money, money, money, money…

[Post-Chorus/Breakdown]
Spread it like...
Spread it like...
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do
Spread it like...

[Outro]
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do
Visualize it, I'll give you something to do
