[Intro]
There's not a soul in here

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your house and dump like the trash man
All up in your grill, but I'm not a fan
Merlyn, I do no hat trick, just show me where the cash at
Then show me where the hash at, fuck that
Show me where the cash at
(There's not a soul in here)
I would rather be on acid, rather make investments
They'll come out of that debt, we'll come out of those bedsheets
I'm like the IRS, pull up to your address
I was trying my best to seizure, but pull it like Keisha
(There's not a soul in here)
Johnny Dang gon' ice my diamonds, up out that freezer
I used to be broke, I don't got amnesia
I used to deal with both, now it's black victims
She know not to call collect if she go to prison
(There's not a soul in here)

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
(There's not a soul in here—)
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
(Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out)
(Now 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
At night I bring them out, I was sleeping upside-down
Keep you up, I come around, they stay right up on my tip
Send me a pic whenever you slip, hoping this outflow my scales
Full throttle whenever I blaze, fifty mil', put it under my wheel (There's not a soul in here—)
Human, I see through your eyes
Until my CCC wide open to my skin
They can see they run, they feel like they been kicking DDR
Bustin' out the bar, human of the tour
They grip three types of the gas, miss the days I can't get back (There's not a soul in here—)

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at? (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out, throw down, ho out, know 'bout, throw down, hold out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
(There's not a soul in here—)
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat (Ba-dam!)
G-P to S and figure, where you niggas at (Show out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that (Ayy, clip, ho out)
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
