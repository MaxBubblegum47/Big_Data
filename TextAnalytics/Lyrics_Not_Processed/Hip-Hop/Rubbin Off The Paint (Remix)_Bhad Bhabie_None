[Intro]
That's what I thought you said
Now let me offer this as a rebuttal
Aye gang gang, aye
Aye gang gang

[Verse]
I said lil bitch I be ballin' but I'm dodging them courts
I just signed another deal, daddy hatin' of course
He don't wanna see me win, instead he lyin' in court
Fake ass artists don't like me, throwin' rocks at my fort
Big ass crib off in the hills, you couldn't hit if you tried
Just made history, and I ain't slip I'm still on the rise
They take pictures, need a witness, now I'm flexin' like it's fitness
All this fame don't mean I still won't knock a bitch right out they britches
Been in my bag, money I'll snag, fresh off the jet in L.A
These bitches are gay, lookin' like drags, might as well get 'em a mask
I got it made now, crib wit' a maid now
First they switched on me, they wishin' they stayed down
We got stats up, me and you don't match up
What you make a year ain't even half of what they tax us
What you earnin' that's just something to eat
I'll embarrass you, I'll have you sittin' suckin' your teeth
They burn bridges, I'll burn money like it's nothin' to me
Bitch I'm a star, I'm iconic, you ain't nothin' like me
When they find you on the scene, there ain't nothin' to see
The Gucci store in my account I'm seein' nothin' but G's
I got blue bell on my wrists and blue bands in my pocket
11 mili on the gram, bitch I'm extra poppin'
Couple foreigns in my driveway, must be border hoppin'
Blowin' up the feds, watchin' like I'm more than coppin'
But I won't ever change, swervin' through these lanes
Cost of fame, now they speak my name, but I'm on my game
Want these racks, you can keep the change, fans go insane
Lil baby fuckin' up these commas, rubbin off the paint
