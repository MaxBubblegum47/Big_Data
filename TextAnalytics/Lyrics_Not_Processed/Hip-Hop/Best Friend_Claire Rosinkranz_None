Wanna be on your side
You don't believe me
And you think I'm always choosing to hurt you
I wanna cheer you on
But something just feels kinda wrong
But I know deep in my heart I'm being stubborn
Hey, hey, hey
I've got a confession to make
It shouldn't be too hard to say
So hey
I wanna be your best friend
Just like we were back then
Lately all we do is fight
That's not something that I like
(wanna be) wanna be your best friend
It's hard to predict the mood
Are we angry or are we cool
We're used to acting like fools
When we were only 5 and 3
We were the best power team
I want to relive that dream
Hey, hey, hey
I've got a confession to make
It shouldn't be too hard to say
So hey
I wanna be your best friend
Just like we were back then
Lately all we do is fight
That's not something that I like
(wanna be) wanna be your best friend
I will be by your side
If you let me have a try
I will be by your side
If you let me have a try
I will be by your side
If you let me have a try
I wanna be your best friend
Just like we were back then
Lately all we do is fight
That's not something that I like
(I) I wanna be your best friend
