[Intro]
Yeah, can you feel it? (yeah)

[Chorus]
I used to feel so devastated
At times, I thought we'd never make it
But now we on our way to greatness (greatness, greatness)
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I used to feel so devastated (yeah)
At times I thought we'd never make it (yeah)
But now we on our way to greatness (yeah)
And all that ever took was patience (yeah)

[Verse]
Okay, just gettin' better each day
Stackin' that cheddar, cheesecake
Look up to the Lord, we pray, tryna be my best each day
And 'til I'm laid to rest we lay, yeah
'Til the time bein', we lit
Hopin' I don't let it get all in my head
I don't need the money just to say that I'm rich
Couple little honeys wanna get in my bed
But they used to run from me when I had nothin'
Now they want to fuck 'cause they see me stuntin'
Nigga came up off the hustlin'
Livin' in the lap of lux and I'm feelin' like the man
If you ain't in my Chucks, then you wouldn't understand
Homie, 'bout these rubberbands on me
Make her wanna dance for me
Prolly leave her man for me, standin' in the stands, goddamn
(She used to front way back, now she just a fan, yeah)

[Chorus]
I used to feel so devastated
At times, I thought we'd never make it
But now we on our way to greatness (greatness, greatness)
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I used to feel so devastated (yeah)
At times I thought we'd never make it (yeah)
But now we on our way to greatness (yeah)
And all that ever took was patience (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I put my pain on the cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowin' and sailin'
So just go with the feelin'
Baby, soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes
I put my pain in the cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowin' and sailin'
So just go with the feelin'
Baby, soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, skrrt skrrt
Woo, yeah

[Chorus]
I used to feel so devastated
At times, I thought we'd never make it
But now we on our way to greatness (greatness, greatness)
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I used to feel so devastated (yeah)
At times I thought we'd never make it (yeah)
But now we on our way to greatness (yeah)
And all that ever took was patience (yeah)

[Outro]
I used to feel so (so devastated)
At times I thought we'd (we'd never make it)
Now we on our way (yeah, yeah)
And all that ever took was patience
