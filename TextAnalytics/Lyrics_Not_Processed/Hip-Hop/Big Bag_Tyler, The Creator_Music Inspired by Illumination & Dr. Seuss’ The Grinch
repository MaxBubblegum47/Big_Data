[Verse 1]
That's a goal
Could you please tell me what you know about skippin' 24, 25
'Cause your mom was at her 9-to-5
Still stacking up the dough
I was wrapping gifts age six with the paper bandanas
Mom was always honest, I ain't never had a Santa Claus
She was my amigo like my buddies from Atlanta
We was hopin' for a signal, too afraid to change the channel, yo

[Chorus]
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
Run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that
I run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that

[Verse 2]
That's a big step, snow boots
But it's hot in herre, '02
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Quick, fast, big Max with the big bag, I throw 'em
You stay up, get cake up
For new gifts I take 'em
You wake up like big mad (Where's my gifts?)
Roof to roof, I jump, I jump, I take, I take
It feels the void, I want, I want (More)
Way that I sneak in
I'm about as low as self-esteem when I creep in (Boy)
Don't make noise, my feet thin
I'm looking for the paper, same color my green skin
Toys what is on the list
When it comes to this, I'm too legit
Tell all them kids that he be the Grinch
When they ask who has type of heart to do this

[Chorus]
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
It's me
