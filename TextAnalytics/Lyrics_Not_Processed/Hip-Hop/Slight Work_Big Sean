[Intro: BIg Sean]
Gotta work - slight work
D - town to the DMV!
Diplo, wassup!

"Work it, work it!"
Probably got your girl going crazy
Drunk white bitches
“work it, wo-wo-work it, oh)”

[Verse 1: Wale]
I can do it all and it ain't no problem
Ain't nobody harder than a nigga Folarin
Bitch, I go hard, I'm ballin', I'm globetrottin'
And my flow art my nigga, I'm Mozart with it
As often, I do this
I turn a straight prude bitch into a nudist
Foolish, I be on that new shit
And I'm blowing up like bitches we went to school with
Ain't nobody checking for your garbage
Lot of intuition, I ain't never finished college
Never hit the mall and forever get it all
Any broad bet I lay her like I'm dressin' for the fall, nigga
And I'm all that, hit the passenger door
Shawty was Pinkberry sweet and I ain't lactose
I ain't tryna brag though
I just know I'm that dope
Kick game bojack, my Bo Jacks Tae Bo
And it ain't no problem
You race to these broads, I relay and baton em
Bitches ain't around one thou
But when you step out, why these bitches run out
Double MG shit, I put the set down
Rick James that, bad bitches on the couch
Word play, Olubowale is my first name
I think I'm Koko B. Ware, you just a bird babe
I got a pair of J's, I roll a pair of J's
We up in Diamond Supply, spending that carat cake
Let em marinate, you forever late
A million home sellers couldn't find a realer state

[Hook: Wale]
"Work it!"
It's light work
Right work
Wrong drink, the right work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Bitch you ain't a boss 'til you cut a fuckin' paycheck
Only thing between me and your bitch is a latex
Man, and I ain't into saving these hoes!
My nigga, tell me where you see the cape at?
B-I-B-I bitch, B-I-G
Two things that I don't need are you and my ID
I'mma need a yellow cab and a yellow bad bitch
Green faces but a nigga dodgin' yellow badges
Woop! Cause I'm drunk..
Under 25, living the fuckin life
White America said I'd be doing 25 to life
And just for that, I'mma blow 25 tonight
You make 25 a year, I make 25 a night, whoa!
Blocka blocka blocka!
Bitch get hit with my Ciroc-a Vodka chopper
Taking body shots: blocka-blocka-blocka!
Probably in your girl's dreams, probably in your daughter's locker
Top floor like I'm out tanning
And they stole your whole delivery now that's outlandish
I guess like the delivery man, I'm outstanding
Car tinted
I'm in that tint like I'm out camping
God damn it, I'm one hell of a guy
Looking down on a cloud: that's a hell of a high
Bitch I gets ghost, the way she screaming "Big!"
Niggas couldn’t tell if I was dead or alive

[Hook: Wale]
"Work it!"
It's light work
Right work
Wrong drink, the right work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work


Probably got your girl going crazy, crazy..
"Work it!"
It's light work
Right work
Wrong drink, the right work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Outro: Wale and Big Sean]
From the D-Town to the DMV, got all these bad bitches
Tryna get on me..
We need to see ID
