[Chorus]
Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feelin'
Gonna be a good day
A good day

[Verse 1]
Woke up, just woke up
My girlfriend warned me that I drink too much
Advil, the good pill
Head pounds like the bass on a party bus
Memories, no memories
The Instagram's tellin' me everythin'
And I regret nothin', oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I feel like a million bucks in the toilet
Ooh-ooh-ooh, my head to my toes to my soul has been poisoned
Livin' proof, that even when your whole life has been destroyed Shhh...
You still can enjoy it

[Chorus]
Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feelin'
Gonna be a good day
A good day

[Refrain]
A good day (It's gonna be a what?)
A good day

[Verse 2]
Last night, 'bout last night
Got in a fight with the karaoke mic
Shots fired, by Fireball
Can't tell what's the ceilin' or what's the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I feel like a million bucks in the toilet
Ooh-ooh-ooh, my head to my toes to my soul has been poisoned
Livin' proof, that even when your whole life has been destroyed Shhh...
You still can enjoy it

[Chorus]
Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feelin'
Gonna be a good day
A good day

[Bridge]
Keep it goin' up, I'll keep it goin', I'll keep it goin', ah-woo
Keep it goin', I'll keep it goin', I'll keep it goin', ah-woo
When the mornin' comes, when the mornin' comes, still, we're goin', ah-woo
Keep it goin', I'll keep it goin', I'll keep it goin', ah-woo

[Interlude]
Aww yeah, okay, I'm goin' to sit down for a sec
I need a Bloody Mary

[Chorus]
Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say 
(Aww... ouch)
Today is gonna be a good day 
(That's right)
Don't care what anybody else say 
(Don't care, don't care what anybody says)
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feelin'
Gonna be a good day
A good day
Gonna be a good day 
(Keep it goin', ah-woo)
Don't care what anybody else say 
(Keep it goin', ah-woo)
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feelin'
Gonna be a good day 
(Keep it goin', ah-woo)
A good day

[Outro]
Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Good day
Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Good day
Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Good day
Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Good day
