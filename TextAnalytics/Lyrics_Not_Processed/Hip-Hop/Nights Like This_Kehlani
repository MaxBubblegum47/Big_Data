[Verse 1: Kehlani]
You act like you need remindin'
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

[Chorus: Kehlani]
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
Took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

[Chorus: Kehlani]
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

[Bridge: Kehlani]
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, "Hit my line"
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...

[Chorus: Kehlani 
with Ty Dolla $ign
]
On some nights like this
, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya (Missin' ya)
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love? (Love)
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just 
wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up (
Switch it up
)
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)

[Outro: Kehlani]
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl
