[Intro: Big Pharrell]
Yo! It's money time, nigga!
Yezzir, whoa yeah, hey

[Hook: Pharrell]
I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle
All the hoes!
They screaming "Oh-oh!
Lil nigga go!
Go for the gold!"

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, "B-I, B-I", bitch I do it to death
If I come with half, bet I leave with the rest
Okay, you might be cool getting 50%
I'm like "fuck you doing? I need Diddy percent!"
Got a million on line 1 and another mil' dialing in
Momma on line 4, telling me how much not to spend
'Ye on line 3 telling me how we 'bout to win
You on hold tryna get conferenced in
I ju- I just gotta have it
Imagine and make it happen, I prayed about it and grabbed it
My life is a fucking movie, the baddest bitches get casted
I'm in a race with myself to see who could get it the fastest
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check with no ink
I get it

[Hook: Pharrell]
I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard the shuttle
All the hoes!
They screaming "Oh-oh!
Lil nigga go!
Go for the gold!"

[Post-Hook: Pharrell]
Hey! Get it, get it, nigga we can get it
Get it, get it, nigga you can get it
Get it, get it, nigga I can get it
Yea, yea, my nigga we can get it, let's go

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Whoa! The sky never seemed so low
Looking at her like "you never seemed so close"
I had a dream about a trillion in cash
It's time to make it happen!
I'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine
Talking cash, you gotta fake an accent
I've broke enough tree down that I could make a cabin
Look: I turn all my problems to ash
All my wants into haves and then divided it by half
Pass it on to my man, write my will out then
Pass it on to my fam and finally become a man
I had a dream I was greatest of all time
Greatest of all Bigs, greatest of all Seans
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check with no ink
I get it

[Hook: Pharrell]
I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard the shuttle
All the hoes!
They screaming "Oh-oh!

Go for the gold!"

[Post-Hook: Pharrell]
Hey! Get it, get it, nigga we can get it
Get it, get it, nigga you can get it
Get it, get it, nigga I can get it
Yea, yea, my nigga we can get it, let's go
