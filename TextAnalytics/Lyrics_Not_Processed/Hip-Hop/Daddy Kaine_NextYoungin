[Intro]
(Spain, what you doing?)

[Chorus]
This that G-Model 6, she let me hit when pigs fly
So I put a cup on a plane
This bitch trippin' on me, I'on know why (Huh)
Ho, you not even my main
I'm rockin Louis V, Balmain
I leave a opp wet up in the rain
Too many bitches feel like Daddy Kaine (Let's go)
Bob The Builder, I hit you with a crane

[Verse 1]
Gotta bag on you, nigga, what's up? (Lil' bitch)
I got nothing but run to my blood (Swoo)
He say he got muddy in his cup
But, I found out it that it was the test (No cap)
He say us and the [?] come up
Man, I hop out the Bentley truck (Interior wait, skrrt, skrrt)
Don't fuck this shit up
She lick it up so good, it made me cuss, fuck (Uh)

[Post-Chorus]
Gotta run it up (Uh)
Big boss moves, can't fuck it up (Uh)
In the strip club, might chuck it up
Bought her a new ass, now she got double butt
I made to drip in the mirror
[?] so silly, I'm finna rack up a milli
I might hit you with this rakе, I'm not talkin' Billy
[?]

[Verse 2]
I got treasure on my neck, feel likе Nicholas (Woo)
Karen said she don't know me, but she stalkin' my page
Got this nigga, why he strippin' up in my bedroom?
And just like a game, and he rage (Hah)
Look at me, I made a way (Let's get it)
Had to push some people out the way (No cap)
These niggas be tryna stay (Let's go)
Six feet under, that's where you gon' lay

[Chorus]
This that G-Model 6, she let me hit when pigs fly
So I put a cup on a plane
This bitch trippin' on me, I'on know why (Huh)
Ho, you not even my main
I'm rockin Louis V, Balmain
I leave a opp wet up in the rain
Too many bitches feel like Daddy Kaine (Let's go)
Bob The Builder, I hit you with a crane
This that G-Model 6, she let me hit when pigs fly
So I put a cup on a plane
This bitch trippin' on me, I'on know why (Huh)
Ho, you not even my main
I'm rockin Louis V, Balmain
I leave a opp wet up in the rain
Too many bitches feel like Daddy Kaine (Let's go)
Bob The Builder, I hit you with a crane (Woo)

[Verse 3]
Rockin' a two tone, niggas be cluesless
Yeah, they stuck in the loophole
You look like a flute, ho, move, ho
But you made it this far, nigga, I give you kutos (Uh)
I just don't understand how a motherfucker like me ain't put up [?]
Your face, you a disgrace, don't slip up
Nigga, there's a time and a place
My niggas stay ready, they finna catch this case
Pull something like a cat, it'll scratch your face
Ray J like Mace, shit, I need some space
I need to get away from the whole human race
'Cause niggas be plastic, I know that they be fake
But I'm livin' good, I got steak on my plate
'Cause niggas be plastic, I know that they be fake
But I'm livin' good, I got steak on my plate

[Outro]
Lil' bitch
