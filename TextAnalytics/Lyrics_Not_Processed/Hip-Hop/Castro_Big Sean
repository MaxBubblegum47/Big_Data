Cubans on me like I'm Castro
Hit your bitch with a backstroke
Spanish bitch, JLo

In the kitchen, have a bake off
She gon' snort her whole damn face off

EA Sports, I'm in the Playoffs (in the game)
I'm in Saks goin' AWOL
I'm at Neimans goin' AWOL
Hit your bitch in the Aloft
Head cool, but the pussy wack
Wanna unfuck her, give her pussy back
Cuban on your boy, I'm Castro
Hit your bitch with a backstroke
Medell√≠n, Pablo
Money bags, Wells Fargo
Call my driver, where the car go?
100 thousand in my cargo
I get dope by the cargo
I got whips, no car note
I got whips, no slave
All my cribs got maids
All my cribs like a maze
Shit so big, they amazed
Still thuggin', they amazed
Put me on a track with 'Ye
In the kitchen rocking 'Ye's
In the trenches with the Js
Feds listenin', we don't do the phone
They record everythin' we say

[Chorus: Yo Gotti, 
Kanye West
 & 
Quavo

Cubans on me like I'm Castro
Hit your bitch with a backstroke

In the kitchen, have a bake off
She gon' snort her whole damn face off

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quavo, Huncho
My life like Pablo
Cuban hoes fall in love with a nigga
They'll treat me like Fabio
Off white like shell toes
Stick to the money, velcro
Standin' on the top ropes
Then I jump down, hit you with the elbow
Why do the birds need a plane if they can fly?
I be standin' in the field with the fire
So many onions in the trap, make me cry
My styrofoam got more oil than Dubai
Ridin' round with extendo
Ridin' round with extendo
Never, never, serve ya kinfolk
Never, never, serve ya kinfolk
Niggas shootin' out the window
Niggas shootin' at your window
Yeah, you better keep your head low
Feds watchin', better lay low

[Chorus: Yo Gotti, 
Kanye West
 & 
Quavo

Cubans on me like I'm Castro
Hit your bitch with a backstroke
Spanish bitch, JLo
Dope money, Pablo
Astronaut, take off

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Anti lame nigga,
 
take your girl like a pain killer
Just saw a picture of your first baby mama, look like a train hit her
Can't finesse me, I'm the finest, 
AKA, it's your Highness
I don't know if she got a snort habit or the bitch got sinus
Pyrex tried to sign us, bakin' soda tryna sign us
Got a red stove and a gold fork, shit lookin' like the Niners
Told shawty, you a minus, and I say it out of kindness
Cuban links change the climate, dick tall, she can climb it
Sold so many damn bags, I coulda went diamond
Watch, wristband diamond, on my neck look diamond
Simon says nigga stop takin' my shit, nigga, start rhymin'
4 rings like an Audi,
 
hotel suite, cloudy

[Chorus: Yo Gotti, 
Kanye West

Cubans on me like I'm Castro
Hit your bitch with a backstroke
Spanish bitch, JLo
Dope money, Pablo
Astronaut, take off
John Travolta 
(face off)
In the kitchen, have a bake off
She gon' snort her whole damn face off
