[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Now, I'm a nigga to keep to myself, I don't fuck wit' nobody
I'm quiet, I'm thuggin'
But I also flex, may God protect the nigga pulled the trigga on my cousin
Well I might be crazy but as I cruise in my Mercedes, I ride by niggas that wanna spray me
Hit 'em up swiftly fo' the police come
I'm immune to this shit 'cause I'm rollin' wit' the niggas in the hood and that's how we play
Want to feel a Mossberg pump hit yo' chest?
Them sawed-offs ain't shit to be fuckin' with
Lucky that my niggas pinned ya
Nigga, whatever, like Ken say
Sin flipped again
Lil' Lay got the upper hand 'cause he got the red beam, dead they lay
If you see a nigga dash wit' the leather mask, let him pass, tell nobody blast
Hit a innocent nigga, should never been there in the first place Fuck, you got yo' curse today, hah
Want to die hard, nigga? Wanna get up and buck and fuck shit up, do what you want?
Show a bitch Krayzie Bone real with mine
And when I let loose you'll feel the vibe, nigga
Killin' my contender 'cause I got to get the money
Get the platinum for the pay
But I'ma be a thug about my business
And I gotta do some flippin' if a nigga ain't got my bank

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Foe tha love of tha money, I keep spendin' yo
Just sum pap low shit, gotta let 'em hang low
Swangin' lead from my 44 magnum though
Wit' ah nuttin' indo smoke, when my thugs be sure, sure
Hope ya know, I rip heartz, it's on, jackin' move
Then ya betta figure again, and quit plottin
Takin' over this everyday, stoppin' to tha tough
Double Glock and it's not forgotten
Bitchez drop in Tha Clair
It's tha Bone Thugs, in this shit wit' Eazy E and we made it
And ah nigga wanna hate me cause I'm famous
I'd still leave 'em in tha streetz, you can't blame us (lady luv)
Cause when they catch me without my heat, and I'm thuggin
In tha streetz and I'm rollin
Thuggin by the deadliest G's, you can't fuck wit us
To the pressure out of pressure, I'm loadin, blow you up
Y'all know we don't worship sin, it's tha heartz of men
And we'd tested stress, wanna be blessed consists of tha sin
In tha wayz of tha sin, to be dead. (Chorus)

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
And I promised, that all tha soulz would last
Til the dayz of tha livez of tomorrow
And if you'd follow, tha end of the world
Should ah come ah so soon, so I just follow, I know
I know, hey, how ta get down foe my thang
Enemiez fold ya, lettin' me soulz, gonna catch ya
Flossin' all tha way
Welcome to Tha Land, where all my chemicalz unfold
It goez, around up in slow-mo
Been tickin', and I land down to Newport
I'm alone, yes, but I may not rest
Police will see me silenced stressin
Nigga was steppin' up in ah, when I catched them thievin
And I got 'em and there, gotta learn their lesson
Blastin', no more, no I'm not havin' it
Breakin' apart foe neva my daddy
Lil' Ripsta defeat go pathless, so I get crazy
And I face now's nasty blastin
For tha Bone, For tha Bone, hit 'em up, and lesson up tha violence
Screamin' on ah my murda mo, bullets get niggas, let's begin
Ah new riot, hittin, and buckin them down to tha pave
Cause I'm in tha new sense of me grave
Couldn't you hataz, wouldn't be saved, hate 'em
Hate ta shook, and put ah pen up in dem
Foe tha love of money makin' go crazy
And Benjamin Franklin pleaze come save me
Hit tha weed, and y'all in, rollin yo finga but spot ya
Bam em, yam em, fiend foe tha greenm see everybody sweatin
Foe tha scenez, still in ah myst wit' tha clich
An unpropable way of ah trial cause it's tha funk, sing

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
(Now give it to 'em)
Ya, gotta sit back, smoke and choke, meditate, mental state
Wit' tha Bone, B-ONE. We steadily grieve on, givin' you what
You need man, eternal Bone, shock 'em, drop 'em, pop 'em
Let 'em know Bone ain't no hoes (no, no)
You hataz make feellike, you wanna feel my motherfuckin 44
But I gotta stay clean, it's cool, then unless he freein
I'm mean sum cheeze, me and my niggas, and this Mo' Thug, Mo' Thug
Cavalry, on tha streetz
Ready ta ride, when it's time ta ride, ready ta kill
When it's time ta kill, you gon' die, you' gon' die
I've been tryin if you really wanna ride on down wit' Bone
Then come on, come on. If ya really wanna ride, get down
But get stuff, but ya come on, come on

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
Sit back and let this thug shit clog up yo' mind
