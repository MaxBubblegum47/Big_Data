Chorus:
No where to run nowhere to hide (we done tried)
There's no escaping judgement time (realise)
When the Lord comes riding through (yeah just the two of us)

Verse 1
Krayzie
As im walkin past the casket
Nigga tryin' to keep from collapsing
Never realizing how drastic man this is tragic
We done lost another soldier to the streets
And anotherï»¿ friend of me
He went to a better place so they say
Im really not feeling the vibe of dying no time soon
But if God is willing
When i repent from my sinning
Peace so i'm living forgiven
This for (?) he ain't lookin' too good
He took the toughest fall of all
Murda murda murda murda murda
So rest in peace (Rest in peace)
Tombstone you know I got your babies
And they safe with me (Safe with me)
We're running up to the cemetery
Eyes very teary
Wearin black khakis suits and black boots
Got gats too
Wanna put in some work
But damn it hurts
To see a family member covered with dirt
Man thats the worst
When I die
I want all my mother fuckers to rise
And on my tombstone
Just write this nigga here was live
CHORUS
X2
Ayo these streets got me stressed
But I been a soldier since birth
The way my people is dying off
You got me thinking i'm cursed
So I just pray to the Lord
To help me take the pain away
Please forgive me for my sins
And let me live another day
And dog, I'm reminiscing on the things we done
It seems the moment you died
My little nephew became my son
Dad, before you died I always wanted to apologise
Now I look in my momma face
It just makes me want to cry
Loraine? one love
You been my nigga for years
But who woulda ever thought
That I would have to shed you tears
But only God knows why
And he's the one with the answers
Pop, I swear we'd be kicking it
If there was a cure for cancer
And Clinton thug, peace
I pour my liquor for y'all
And the day that I die
I'm gon' be looking for y'all
I never take life for granted
I be a thug for life
And my spirit is so tough
You got to murda me twice
CHORUS
X2
The average life span's between
Zero and seventy the year was 2000
A whole line of niggas was heavenly
Dyin' in they sleep
Let's talk about niggas who died on they feet
No surrender, no retreat
Who runnin' (who?)
We is
But actually its the thesis
Tha iron is fine dogz in slacks in tha breezes?
Fuck it 2 pieces
Bigger than mine

Treasure every moment and put all enemies on tha guest list
Sum will come
