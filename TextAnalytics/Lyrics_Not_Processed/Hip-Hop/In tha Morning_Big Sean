[Intro: YG]
It's YG, 4 Hunnid!
(Oddz N Endz, Oddz N Endz)
Countin' my cheddar

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & YG]
I wake up in the mornin'
Pull them panties to the side
See me twistin' up that Cali
Cause you know I stay high
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough (high!)
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my oh! (high!)
I wake up in the mornin'
Pull them panties to the side
See me twistin' up that Cali
Cause you know I stay high
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough (high!)
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my oh! (high!)

[Verse 1: YG]
Wake up in the morning, fuck my bitch, she fuck me back
After I nut, she clean it up, we count a stack
If you were around the corner, you could probably hear her moanin'
I wake the neighbors up, because I fuck her every mornin'
I'm a muthafuckin' gangsta, got some straps up in the closet
In these streets is beef, so I keep the deuces in my pocket
Even though I'm on probation, keep the blunt in rotation
Smokin' some fire, got it from my connect, and he Jamaican
I'm just tryna make a dollar out of 15 cents
So I hit the block, and straight pimp me a bitch
My daddy told me, "Nigga, get it how you live"
So it's money over bitches, nigga that's just what it is
Keep it G till I die, to these bitches I lie
Walk up out the mall lookin' so fly
All I know my bank account got long ass digits
California weed, countin' cheese, fuckin' bad bitches

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & YG]
I wake up in the mornin'
Pull them panties to the side
See me twistin' up that Cali
Cause you know I stay high
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough (high!)
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my oh! (high!)
I wake up in the mornin'
Pull them panties to the side
See me twistin' up that Cali
Cause you know I stay high
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough (high!)
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my oh! (high!)

[Verse 2: Big K.RI.T.]
I'm talkin' early mornin' fuckin', bedside suckin'
While you turnin' on your oven, I was pullin' out and bustin'
On her back, never in her cat, never in between
If you got a superbad bitch like mine, shawty know what I mean
I'm talking slob on my nob like a pro
Zonin', zonin', blowin', she might never let it go, on the low
She's a very freaky girl, don't say no to daddy
She get wet when I swing down, dump it in my Cadi
She built like a thoroughbred, ride like a glass house
Push on the pedal, she shake and shiver and mad shy
Breakfast of champions, Benz and ass and titties
Kush and orange juice, servin' up and hella pimpin'

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign, YG & Big Sean]
I wake up in the mornin'
Pull them panties to the side
See me twistin' up that Cali
Cause you know I stay high
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough (high!)
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my oh! (high!)
I wake up in the mornin'
Pull them panties to the side
See me twistin' up that Cali
Cause you know I stay high
Boi, boi...
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough (high!)
B.I.G Sean Don, nigga!
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Do it
Fuck my bitch, then count my oh! (high!)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Yeah, I wake up with hard dick
And the bitch you was dreamin' about
She wake up to the realest nigga
That all of these hoes is dreamin' about
I walk in the bank, I'm cleanin' it out
Jewelry store, I'm gleamin' it out
I'm smacking these hoes, and I skeet on their blouse
You keep them at home, I'm just leasing them off
Westside! And I don't mean the fuckin' coast
She screaming B.I.G., but it ain't no fuckin' ghost
The hoes that turned you down is the ones I fuck the most
I'm burnin' all this bread, so we might as well fuckin' toast
Man these niggas lookin' at me like they're hoes or somethin'
Ya'll barely touching green, y'all are holes-in-one
These niggas is hoes and cunts
Damnit life's a slut, but I bust a nut
And it's no wonder why all these niggas look like my oldest son
It's me, Sayitaint, and that ghetto ass nigga, dealer man
Lightin' purple haze, you would've thought I was chillin' with Killa Cam
Goin' around and around and around and around
This shit is feelin' like ceilin' fans
I feel the hands feelin' in my pants
I'm like, "Shut the fuck up, ho, and get in this van"

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign, YG & Big Sean]
I wake up in the mornin'
Pull them panties to the side
Boi
See me twistin' up that Cali
Boi
Cause you know I stay high
Boi, boi
I do it
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
B.I.G
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough (high!)
YG
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
K.R.I.T
Fuck my bitch, then count my oh! (high!)
Bitch
I wake up in the mornin'
Pull them panties to the side
Real pimpin', we the shit, ho
See me twistin' up that Cali
Cause you know I stay high
My bitch
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
My bitch
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough (high!)
My bitch
Fuck my bitch, then count my dough
Fuck my bitch, then count my oh! (high!)
