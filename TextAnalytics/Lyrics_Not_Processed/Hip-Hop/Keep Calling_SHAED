I know it isn’t fair to keep calling
I promise not to make that mistake
Soon or later, I’ll be ringing
Gonna have to say I’m sorry
It happens when I start drinking
I keep calling
You keep calling me
Keep falling back in love with
I keep calling
You keep calling me
Keep falling back in love with
I know I shouldn’t tell you I’m hurting
I promised we would both be okay
Soon or later, I’ll be ringing
Gonna have to beg forgiveness
It happens when I start drinking
I keep calling
You keep calling me
Keep falling back in love with
I keep calling
You keep calling me
Keep falling back in love with
(back in love, back in love)
Keep falling
(back in love, back in love)
I keep hitting up your
(back in love, back in love)
I keep on falling
(back in love, back in love)
With you
Soon or later, I’ll be ringing
Gonna have to beg forgiveness
It happens when I start drinking
(Chorus)
(back in love, back in love)
Why do I keep calling
(back in love, back in love)
You keep hanging up the
(back in love, back in love)
Why do I keep falling
(back in love, back in love)
With you
Keep calling
Keep falling
In love with you
With you
