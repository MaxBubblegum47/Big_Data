[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Gotta get real again, gotta get real again, oh

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Know, you got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I want you, I want you
To turn up on me every night when I see you
Better recognize when I see you
I really want you, you, you
Hit the club for you, you, you
Lightskin got you new, new, do
Even look like Lauren Lo too
I be tripping, but this money ain't
Hit the strip, check my money length
Sorry if my whip covered in dank
Cause I've been rollin' with this skunk all day
All these bitches know that you're my nigga
I ain’t trippin' off of any of your niggas
Cause I don't care about your nigga, four niggas
Five niggas, six niggas, I ain’t give a shit about shit, nigga
Girl I see you

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Know, you got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I want you, I want you
To turn up on me every night when I see you
Better recognize when I see you
I really want you, you, you
Hit the club for you, you, you
Lightskin got you new, new, do
Even look like Lauren Lo too
I be tripping, but this money ain't
Hit the strip, check my money length
Sorry if my whip covered in dank
Cause I've been rollin' with this skunk all day
All these bitches know that you're my nigga
I ain’t trippin' off of any of your niggas
Cause I don't care about your nigga, four niggas
Five niggas, six niggas, I ain’t give a shit about shit, nigga
Girl I see you

[Interlude: Top Cat]
Only special request fi the gyal dem
From north, south, east and west
For the body ah look good you know y'haffi
God bless, bruk wild, bruk a man spine
God bless, bruk wild, bruk a man spine

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
(Gotta get real again)
Girl you must be doin' magic
Girl you must be doin' magic
Turn fuckin' you to a habit
I could name a lot of things any other man
Won’t do for you, I do for you
When I hit you at your condo real late
Check the scene and see if you straight
Then cut like kids cake
I got that feelin' for you, that feelin' that you crave
Each time I do it for you, I make that bad pussy behave
Now pop it, bottles, the top is so open
The budget, I'm Party so fuck it
The concierge told me
My new baby looking like LeToya Luckett
Let my money get older and older
And older and older like Regis
And she will not fuck with no broke niggas
No, nigga, only the richest

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Know, you got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches
You got niggas and I got bitches (Got bitches)
You got niggas

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I want you, I want you
To turn up on me every night when I see you
Better recognize when I see you
I really want you, you, you
Hit the club for you, you, you
Lightskin got you new, new, do
Even look like Lauren Lo too
I be tripping, but this money ain't
Hit the strip, check my money length
Sorry if my whip covered in dank
'Cause I've been rollin' with this skunk all day
All these bitches know that you're my nigga
I ain’t trippin' off of any of your niggas
'Cause I don't care about your nigga, four niggas
Five niggas, six niggas, I ain’t give a shit about shit, nigga
Girl, I see you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, shout the girls from the East
Who know what's good with me, yeah (Girl, let's)
Shout the ones from the West
Know what's good with PND, oh-oh (Girl, let's)
Stories of you and your girls is all I hear (Girl, let's)
Who do you fuck in the city when I'm not there?
I owe you time
Let's plan somethin' out when I come back from Europe
Swear I'm withholdin' my urges
'Til you get this one-on-one shit like your name Katie Couric
I gotta get you those snow tires for your Mercedes
I'm glad you reminded me, baby
All of these things slip my mind; it's been crazy
Bite on your shoulder, I know that's your favorite
Touching yourself to that video we made a month ago
You a freak and your cover's blown
How you talked me into sendin' that to you, I'll never know
Fuck it, girl; I'm 'bout whatever though
Yeah, I guess a nigga just believe in you and that's proof for you
Could name a lot of things any other man won't do for you
I'll do it for you, that's real

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I want you
To turn up on me every night when I see you
Better recognize when I see you
I really want you, you, you
Hit the club for you, you, you
Lightskin got you new, new, do
Even look like Lauren Lo too
I be tripping, but this money ain't
Hit the strip, check my money length
Sorry if my whip covered in dank
'Cause I've been rollin' with this skunk all day
All these bitches know that you're my nigga
I ain’t trippin' off of any of your niggas
'Cause I don't care about your nigga, four niggas
Five niggas, six niggas, I ain’t give a shit about shit, nigga
Girl, I see you
