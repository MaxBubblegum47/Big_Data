[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Back when it was in style to do the yellow Hummer (Hummer)
Back when I had a job every summer (summer)
Back when I tried to be the number one stunner (stunner)
Back when everybody in the band had a drummer (brr)
Back when the medical insurance was just the hunnids (hunnids)
Back before it was so easy to get a number
Back before George W. used to run it (run it)
Back when me an' all my dogs used to go huntin’ (huntin')

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Boy, we used to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
You know we had to get it in (you know I had to get it)
You know I used to get it in (you know I used to get it)
You know we had to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Schemin', whole team just schemin’

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, me and my whole team seem to put it all together (go)
It's time to make the moves that's gon' put us on forever (uh)
'Cause they stay down like my foot did on the pedal (skrrt)
Hold up, stay down like they shootin' at me
But they never, I can never take you bitches personal
I brought the money outside-in like it's reversible (whoa)
I'm QB on my team, yeah, so don’t rush (rush)
Bitch, start actin’ like a grownup (okay)
M-moving like a boss do
Pimp enough that I can pay for law school (yeah-yeah)
I was raised by a O.G. one (free one)
Talk to me like I'm Obi Wan (boy)
Business moves, you know we don’t discuss
All twenties, talkin' area touch (whoa)
Still runnin' with the dogs like mush
'Cause the only ones we trust is us, an’ hell yeah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
We get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
You know we had to get it in (you know I had to get it)
You know I used to get it in (you know I used to get it)
You know we had to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Schemin', whole team just schemin'
I'm talkin' plottin' an' schemin'

[Verse 3: KeY Wayne]
I ain't even make enough to put some cash in the safe
Didn't even make enough to put some gas in the tank
Plus my phone bill was 86, rent was tryna play me
I couldn't even take what's left to go open up a savings
But my beats was so fire, I could warm a whole house up
But nobody didn't listen, it was quiet as a mouse
I couldn't even help my momma with the lights in the house
This is not exactly what I thought that life was about
So I took the last that I had, hopped on the highway
Got lost in the town, slept on the ground
Lookin' up to God like, "[?]"
Ran into Meek, then I gave him "Amen"
Now it's checks comin' in, praise God, amen
Now I can finally buy a Benz
All the doors was locked, but I had to kick 'em in
But as soon as I got in, boy, you knew I got it in
Boy we used to get it

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Boy, we used to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
You know we had to get it in (you know I had to get it)
You know I used to get it in (you know I used to get it)
You know we had to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Schemin' (yeah), whole team just schemin' (schem, yuh)
I'm talkin' plottin' an' schemin'

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
All I ever did was figure it out (go)
Back when a nigga used to have to live on the couch (uh-huh)
I [?] on this shit just to get through the drought (straight up)
I strategised it in my head, then started livin' it out (go)
Man, these niggas want the perks without doin' the work (work)
Drag my name through the mud without doin' the dirt (damn)
I get your face on a shirt like I'm doin' your merch
They love to talk, I'm 'bout doin' it first, 'cause

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Boy, we used to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
You know we had to get it in (you know I had to get it)
You know I used to get it in (you know I used to get it)
You know we had to get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Schemin', whole team just schemin'
I'm talkin' plottin' an' schemin'
