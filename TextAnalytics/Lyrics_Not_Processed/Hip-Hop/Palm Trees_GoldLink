[Verse 1]
Underneath the palm trees
You can leave your worries
I don't need nobody
You and me together
Run away from mommas
Still live witcha' momma
That's alright, we gon' make this trip together
Poppin' up at parties
Drinkin' on Bacardi
Singin' Cool J, "I just wanna love you betta"
And I just wanna love you betta'
You know cause it's winter weather
And I need my baby back
Ain't I crazy? You know that I need to bring my city back
You know that I need you, girl
Need you like they need these raps
I'm a bad boy and yah mama say don't do it
And you gon' do it
We gon' make a movie
Listen to Alina singing

[Hook]
Underneath the palm trees
You can leave your worries
Listen to the waves
So you wanna get so high?
Breathe me in like air tonight
Listen to the waves
I can be your fantasy
Alina yeah she sung to me
Underneath the palm trees
You can leave your worries
Listen to the waves
So you wanna get so high?
Breathe me in like air tonight
Listen to the waves
I can be your fantasy
Alina yeah she sung

[Verse 2]
I'm so obsessed, wit you girl
Ya' my world
And when we start fuckin', I'ma fuck you up
Excuse me baby, what I want to say was love you up
Double dutch, on the pussy, tell her pucker up
Lemme, lemme tell ya somethin', lemme butter up
You and all yo' insecurities and stuff
Always talk about ya' big boobies ain't big enough
I ain't tell ya that ya perfect, nothin' could replace ya
Lord I thank ya', you so fuckin' clutch
Excuse my language, babygirl you know what's up
Fuckin', makin' love and fuckin', then I fuck it up
Like I said I was gon' do girl, can I bite ya butt?
Fell in love inside the pussy like a sucker punch
Fuck yo nigga too, and fuck yo job and fuck yo crew
I can make a list of freaky shit I wanna do
While I whisper to ya' like, girl

[Hook]
Underneath the palm trees
