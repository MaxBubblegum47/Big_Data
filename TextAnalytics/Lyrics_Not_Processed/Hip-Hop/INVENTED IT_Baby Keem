[Chorus]
Big protein, I'm smokin' lonely for the culture
No TED Talkin', steppin' on a little roach (Yeah)
What that mean? Baby Keem, I invented it
Ten toes down, painkillers 'til I'm feelin' it
Big protein, I'm smokin' lonely for the culture
No TED Talkin', steppin' on a little roach
What that mean? Baby Keem, I invented it
Ten toes down, painkillers 'til I'm feelin' it

[Verse]
Before I leave the house, I tell my bitch that I love her
But that's not 'til I pop a pill, now it's fuck her
That's some shit I can't risk, she's an actress
She just wanna love me, I swear it's a habit
Flip a couple million
Have a couple children then give them my millions, I know
Hang with the demons, they dancin'
Don't dyke with my Dyson
, don't cap on the fashion, I know
My bitch with the extras
Two ho down, now I'm fuckin' on her best friends
Yes, I made a sex tape, but that ain't no secret (Yeah, yeah)
If I tap then I wanna put it on the deep end (Yeah, yeah)
I put the pussy on ice
Can you be my co-sign? She don't think I'm nice
You don't need a thirst trap to show me that I'm right
I might hit the pussy all night, go flight, ayy, pay, ayy, bullshit

[Chorus]
Big protein, I'm smokin' lonely for the culture
No TED Talkin', steppin' on a little roach (Yeah)
What that mean? Baby Keem, I invented it
Ten toes down, painkillers 'til I'm feelin' it
Big protein, I'm smokin' lonely for the culture
No TED Talkin', steppin' on a little roach
What that mean? Baby Keem, I invented it
Ten toes down, painkillers 'til I'm feelin' it
