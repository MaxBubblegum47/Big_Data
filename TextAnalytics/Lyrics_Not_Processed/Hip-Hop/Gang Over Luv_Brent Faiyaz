[Verse 1]
I was hella broke then, I ain't have a dime
But I was always focused, I ain't waste no time
I ain't have a car in my name, I used to walk to work every day
Me and my dawg, like it or not, I came out alright

[Pre-Chorus]
All the homies, we came up the same way
And I swear ain't nothing change
Got a little bit of change in my pocket but I maintain
We were young and in this world, chasin' dreams and girls
Runnin' from our problems
I know that we older now, but that's what we were all about

[Chorus]
I remember we were young, young and dumb
Just some niggas in a rush to grow up
I remember we were young, young and dumb
It was gang over luv, that was us

[Verse 2]
I remember we would cut class, my teachers used to hate me
The only reason that I did that was to keep from goin' crazy
I didn't give a damn 'bout my grades
That's probably why we failed the ninth grade
Me and my dawg, like it or not, we came out okay

[Pre-Chorus]
All the homies, we came up the same way
And I swear ain't nothing change
Way before I ever moved out the house and did the damn thing
We were young and in this world chasin' dreams and girls
Runnin' from our problems
& I know we're older now, but that's what we were all about

[Chorus]
I remember we were young, young and dumb
Just some niggas in a rush to grow up
I remember we were young, young and dumb
It was gang over luv, that was us
