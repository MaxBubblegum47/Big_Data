[Intro]
Fight the cases, I hope y'all beat 'em
You ain't gotta say you real if you real I can see it

[Chorus]
Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real

[Verse 1]
I ain't trippin' on no losses I can always get it back
Ain't trippin' on my exes I can always get 'em back
But that time was wasted I can never get it
And these niggas be the fakest I can never feel 'em
I had love and now it's hate for y'all that's official
I had nightmares of that picture
Or that court room being empty, way back at my final sentence
No letters or no pictures like a nigga just stopped livin'
But I just had to sit back and remember

[Chorus]
Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace my family I can never get 'em back
I can never call my niggas that ain't get back on the nets
Rest in peace my nigga B, he in the clouds, nigga
I spend some time with your daughter, she got your smile, nigga
I had love and now it's hate for y'all that's official
Fuck Curry, I'ma rock with the Pistons
Fuck Peyton, I'ma rock with the Lions
You know I fuck with  every city in the Mitten
Met some real niggas in Kentucky
Bra took 35, no snitching
Lil' bro, if you with these niggas, sit back and remember

[Chorus]
Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real

[Verse 3]
I got some feelings that don't show no more
Me and some of my family, we ain't that close no more
I got some anger build inside me, I control it though
My morals out here runnin' wild, I couldn't control her bro
The first nigga from the family, take that college role
My mom and pop's couldn't even see it that's what hurt me most
Some niggas that I barely know they wanna see me make it
Some niggas I know all my life don't wanna see me blow
I had love and now it's hate for y'all that's official
I had nightmares of that picture
When we left that shootout, you still had bullets in your pistol
I don't fuck with y'all that's official
Nigga, that courtroom was empty way back at me final sentence
Got me like fuck niggas, 'cause

[Chorus]
Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
