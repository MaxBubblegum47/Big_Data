[Intro]
Drop the roof and let the smoke clear (Smoke clear, smoke clear)
(Lemme hear that)

[Verse 1]
Drop the roof and let the smoke clear (Smoke clear, smoke clear)
I got diamonds (Ooh, ooh), doin' toosie slides in both ears
Dice rollin' on the Las Vegas strip tonight
Slip that on (Ooh, ooh), and we might miss the fight
Fuck a knot, I keep the guala in my shorty bag (Ooh, ooh)
You know she one of mine, when she tattoo that ass
I'm a lover boy, 
she love the toys (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Keep it comin', you a rider
This that "Roll myself a J and count my figure" shit
This that "Steppin' out, I feel like I'm that nigga" shit
I dropped thirty on this room, we ain't gon' sleep for shit (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If I catch you nodding off, then it's gon' be some shit

[Chorus]
But you can do what you wanna
Live how you wanna (Ooh, ooh)
Spend what you wanna
Be who you wanna be
A young stunner (Stunner, ooh, ooh)
'Til I D-I-E (Lord, help me)
You can do what you wanna (What you wanna)
Live how you wanna
Spend what you wanna
Be who you wanna be
A young stunner (Stunner)
'Til I D-I-E (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I just run it up before I go (Oh)
Would you tell the world my secrets if I let you close?
M.I.A., missing in action (Oh, oh)
'Cause these days no "Kumbaya"
Niggas be blastin'
Livin' in the midst of, this shit might drive you mad
Feeling pretty mixed up, but this life shit ain't all bad (She work)
Bloody, bloody murder, there ain't no second chances
(Shit crazy as fuck)

[Chorus]
Tell her just do what you wanna (What you wanna)
Live how you wanna
Spend what you wanna (What you wanna)
Be who you wanna be (Die for you)
A young stunner (Die for you, stunner)
'Til I D-I-E (Lord, help me)
You can do what you wanna (What you wanna)
Live how you wanna
Spend what you wanna (What you wanna)
Be who you wanna be (Die for you)
A young stunner (Die for you, stunner)
'Til I D-I-E (Yeah)
