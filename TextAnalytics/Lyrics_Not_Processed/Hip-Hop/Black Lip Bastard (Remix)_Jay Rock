[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
This what you really want, huh?
Turn me up, Ali

[Sample: Donny Hathaway]
I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Black lip bastard,
 
pass me your password
So I can hack inside your brain
See, I too have gone insane
Before I fall I'm sure to curse you all in Jesus' name
Lead shower, Anna Peebles hour, bitch stand the rain
This what y'all really want
Let me get it back Ali
When we do- when we do interviews, don't ask me 'bout no movements
Yeah I'm good
No crews, no-no posses, no cliques
If it ain't 'bout TDE I don't wanna hear that shit, bitch
Look inside my parkin' garage and see a collage
Of every person I despised since the moment I turned five
Calculate my steps and strategically took my time
Even fallin' off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj (so soft)
Eat that pink pussy like it's Friday
Bust one, roam and reload, then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too (hey baby)
Don't fuckin' take me for some kind of fool
I'm kinda the reminder of knowin' Compton ain't kinda cool
Good kid, mad city, mountaintops couldn't see my views
Countertops, we hop over, hit the register, then we move
I hope this shit can register on a regular soon
Before I climb this pedestal
And make you catch my fuckin' stool (bitch)
K.Dot,
 leave 'em grievin' on evenin' news
Even when society break even, I'll break rules

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I told niggas, caught wrecked, then I towed niggas
Fold niggas like clothes and drawers, nigga
Homie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg
Like a cliché to rock a show, is that over your head?
Niggas stretchin' the truth like they choose to do yoga instead
Either that or they depressed, eatin' yogurt in bed
Solar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle
The bass bit the bait,
 
I'm straight, you a gay couple
I ain't thirsty for the deal, wait and make 'em pay double
I'm anxious, when the bacon on the table, I need a muzzle
You're basic like cable to a satellite dish
You was runnin' L.A., now you out of there like Fish
What more can I say? I'm a bastard with black lips
Black shirt, black shades, long black dick
I'm awkward, dog, I'm tryna bargain shop at Saks Fifth
Swung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis, ask 'em

And all we do is it, all we do is do it
All we do is do it, all we do is do it (
nigga squad
)
(
This what you really want
)
All we do is do it
And all we do is it, all we do is do it
All we do is do it, all we do is do it (
nigga squad
)
(
This what you want, I give up
Let Puff Daddy talk to you
The real Puff Daddy
)

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Figg side,
 black nine, black lips, smoke time
Fuck this rap shit, I'm active
Suckin' on titties since I was eight
Hoodie with my shades, I ain't tryna be fake
So don't be talkin' to me, pussy
Runnin' your gums like you be Loc'ing
When the world know that you're nookie
Rookie, softer than infant fabric, I won't have it
When the gun drawn, get rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tatted
Know my niggas movin'
You hesitatin' to hit the lick, what the fuck is you doin'?

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Perpetratin', bitches poppin' Percocet and percolatin'
Freelance for God but do the work of Satan
Whatever works
I'm clever with the words if you haven't noticed yet
Lightyears ahead, I'm bright and I like to get oral sex
Soul brother number one plus one
Gettin' fed like where drugs and guns come from

[Verse 5: Jay Rock]
All we do is do it, shittin' on the competition
Takin' heads off, this Hannibal Lecter music
You niggas don't move me, you niggas just movies
Cut straight to them credits and hit you with a Uzi
Peel off in a dullies,
 truck bed full of toolies
Get home, smoke, poke on some coochie
I'm just fuckin' around, enough with them fairy tales
But I bust heads for real, go 'head—
I'm Jay Rock, you lil' niggas beneath me
How you gon' dance with the devil with two left feet?
Peep, thinkin' you sweet, but you weak
Talkin' out of turn'll leave all of your teeth in the street
Mama taught you better, 
never clash with a giant
Unless you David, remember, my nigga, I'm not Goliath
Feel the wrath of this titan
Hit some water, call it Poseidon
Wig out, 
then hit your ass with a trident
Money on the table my nigga, you know I'm all in
If rap was a drink, you wine, nigga I'm all gin
Hundred proof, recruit a hundred troops who love to shoot
No fluke, my nigga, you know that's what us hunters do
East side up, Watts City mayhem
Choppers, they sprayin' from AM to PM
I'm the silent assassin of the four-headed dragon
Black Hippy blastin'
 
a .50 out the back of the Benz Wagon
Toe-taggin' wack rappers off G.P
You can't see me, your vision ain't 3D
You smokin' on that seaweed, we rollin' up that kiwi
And the Backwood lighted, we high for like three weeks
You payin' for that pussy, but we always get freebies
Top Dawg that ho and throw it like a frisbee, it's history
You know the night and day is ours
Top Dawg conglomerate, Hiii Power, bitch

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Is this what y'all really want?
This Black Hippy shit what y'all really want?
When I'm in interviews, don't ask me 'bout no crews
No posses, no cliques, don't tell me who's gettin' it
I don't give a fuck, nigga
I just paid— I just paid six figures in taxes, nigga
Off Section.80, on some independent shit
Uncle Sam talkin' 'bout, "you an old lost relative," nigga fuck you
K-Dot said it, not Kendrick
Ab-Soul the rawest motherfucker on the planet, nigga
T.D.E., solar system, 
Control System
