[Verse]
You gave me a shoulder when I needed it
You showed me love when I wasn't feeling it
You helped me fight when I was giving in
And you made me laugh when I was losing it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are, you are
The reason why I'm still hanging on
'Cause you are, you are
The reason why my head is still above water

[Chorus]
And if I could, I'd get you the moon
And give it to you
And if death was coming for you
I'd give my life for you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are, you are
The reason why I'm still hanging on
'Cause you are, you are
The reason why my head is still above water

[Chorus]
And if I could, I'd get you the moon
And give it to you
And if death was coming for you
I'd give my life for you

[Bridge]
'Cause you are, you are
Oh, you are
Oh, you are
You are

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are, you are
The reason why I'm still hanging on
'Cause you are, you are
The reason why my head is still above water

[Chorus]
And if I could, I'd get you the moon
And give it to you
And if death was coming for you
I'd give my life for you
