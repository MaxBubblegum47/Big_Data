[Verse: Hoodie Trash]
You're the only one I didn't know I needed in my life
You're the only one I can get behind only this one time
I can see you're bitching about your time on this earth
I think I'm the only one who can clearly see your worth

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time

[Bridge: Hoodie Trash]
I hope I can treat you right
I hope we can win your fight
I hope I can treat you right
I hope we can win your fight

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty & Hoodie Trash]
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time

[Outro: Ryan Beatty and Hoodie Trash, (Hoodie Trash)]
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
(At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind)
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
