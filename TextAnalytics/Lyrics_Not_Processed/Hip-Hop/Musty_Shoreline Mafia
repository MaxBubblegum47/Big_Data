[Intro: Ohgeesy]
Ayy, they ask me how I'm feeling, my nigga I'm feeling lovely
It must be, it must be
All these bitches tryna fuck me
That nigga bitch, all these bitches
Ron Ron do that shit

[Chorus: Ohgeesy]
They ask me how I'm feeling, my nigga I'm feeling lovely
It must be, everywhere I go they wanna fuck me
Musty, uhh my nigga who got that musty?
It must be Ohgees 'cause he stay serving custy
They ask me how I'm feeling, my nigga I'm feeling lovely
It must be, everywhere I go they wanna fuck me
Musty, uhh my nigga who got that musty?
It must be Ohgees 'cause he stay serving custy

[Verse 1: Ohgeesy]
I'm busting, no tussling
Bad bitch a eater that ain't for discussion, she busting and gushing
She dripping and moaning when I get to fucking
Fufu nigga sip on nothing but 'Tussin
I'm pouring the Quali', I'm throwed with my youngins
I pour with my youngins, I go with my youngins
We blowing them hundreds and blowing them 'Woods
I'm a nice ass nigga but I'm misunderstood
Got a ratchet lil bitch and she from Inglewood
I'm moving around, I do nothing but jugg
I'm fucking these ho like a young nigga should
And you'd do the same if you young niggas could
Just bought the Bimmer 'cause that shit look cleaner
How I get this shit, nigga serving the fienders
Nigga bitches snitching like they serving subpoenas
And my niggas all nuts, you get served by a peanut
Your bitch she a slut she get curbed and deleted
Fucked while she pregnant, got nut on your fetus
I'm going too crazy, need to calm down, Jesus
Need to calm down, Jesus

[Chorus: Ohgeesy]
They ask me how I'm feeling, my nigga I'm feeling lovely
It must be, everywhere I go they wanna fuck me
Musty, uhh my nigga who got that musty?
It must be Ohgees 'cause he stay serving custy
They ask me how I'm feeling, my nigga I'm feeling lovely
It must be, everywhere I go they wanna fuck me
Musty, uhh my nigga who got that musty?
It must be Ohgees 'cause he stay serving custy

[Verse 2: Fenix Flexin]
I'm pouring juice by the deuce riding 'round in the coupe
I ain't playing with a bitch, lil baby I thought you knew
Busting scripts with your bitch for the lean
I'm off a bean, I sip nothing that's clean
I got a Sprite, I'ma turn this shit pink
I pop a percocet, pink like my drink
Hold up I'm tripping, you ho-ing or going lil bitch?
What the fuck a nigga mean, he ain't pour up like this
Trying to pull up on my niggas like hold up they got sticks
This a hunned dollar cup, you ainâ€™t po' up like this
I'm a real right nigga need a real right bitch
Need them blue face hundreds, I'm fiending, I gotta sip
If your bitch ain't going, I'm tripping, she gotta dip
I just got the sixteen, no flippin', I'm finna sip
Whole eight, in a two liter
Sipping with my same niggas, no new people
I'm kicking shit, whole gang off prescriptions bitch
Talk chips or my niggas ain't listening
