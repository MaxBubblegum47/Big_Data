[Verse 1]
Uh, uh, got game like Jesus
Hot boy propane, no fever
I got niggas on the doc like a heaver
Bitch I 'on't get left I'ma leaver
A couple homies went left, I 'on't need 'em
You know we got them pints when you need 'em
Tonight I might go up on a feature
I 'on't know why the fuck they hatin' from the bleachers
I'm too busy ballin', I can't hear ya'
I 'on't know why talkin' we ain't equal
Nigga we been poppin' since Evisu
Don't make get to poppin' at your people
Baby them niggas poppin' don't believe 'em
Baby them niggas following the leader
The only thing I follow is a dollar nigga preach to 'em
Drop the top if you gotta drop throw the peace to 'em
See they ain't talkin' bout shit I'm the chosen one
And if a nigga play put a hole in one
Put some cake on a nigga head on his birthday then he dead fuck nigga we ain't goin' for none
They say I'm gone change, shid change gotta come
You know I had change when I came don't front
A lil' nigga but a nigga stayed in front
They be like, "That lil' nigga stay with a big blunt"
I can't stand no hater
What you know about murder?
Don't be speakin' to me, nigga, we don't know ya'
Don't be speakin' to me, nigga, we don't know ya'
I demand my respect, but sorry I cannot comprehend, if it ain't about a check
Kill yourself die, yeah, Russian Roulette
I'ma make sure you all die, mutha'fuckin' bet

[Chorus]
Bein' great takes time
Came a long way
I say I'm fine
I'm on my way
I'm gonna climb all the way
This is success you lookin' at I and I am the best
How many times should I have to stress
I wonder why I'm not like the rest

[Verse 2]
Uh, and she wonder why I cheat
They wonder why I get them for the cheap
Your bitch got "Wonder Why" on repeat
And after we fuck she clean the dick she so neat
Neat freak
We winnin' no cheat sheet
Big shit to you centipedes
Big shit this a A.M.G
Know we havin' drums like KFC
And they know we drop bombs, know when the cops come, better run
Know it's better said than done
Nah we ain't never really runnin' out of funds
See this a one of one you ain't havin' this one
Milk the game teach it to my son
Made man, bitch nigga I'm a don
Pop a couple bottles told my nigga that we won
Already man this shit just begun
I said this already man this shit came from none
Tryna get big like Pun
Tryna be rich like Sean
Me and Killa the new Pimp C and Bun
Underground King where we from
Draped out and dripped up my shit filled up
A whole lot of lean in my cup
It's a whole lot of lean in my cup
I do not like that the fact that they hated
They hated the fact I escaped it
Found me a route and it lead me to paper
That made a statement
They wrote some statements
I had to fallback and I had to pace it
Went on vacation, stashed a few bricks in the basement
Stashed a few bricks in the basement
I had to change my location

[Chorus]
Bein' great takes time
Came a long way
I say I'm fine
I'm on my way
I'm gonna climb all the way
This is success you lookin' at I and I am the best
How many times should I have to stress
I wonder why I'm not like the rest
