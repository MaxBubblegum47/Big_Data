[Intro]
Yeah (Buck! Buck!) come on y'all, it's goin' down
Shouts out to the homie D.O.C. (St. Clair)
Rest In Peace Eazy-E (St. Clair)
Mm-hmm, big ups Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and DJ Quik
It's going down y'all
We up in here, it's the cypher (Flesh-n-Bone)

[Verse 1: Flesh-n-Bone]
See Flesh about to gash ya
No tellin' what me and my niggas 'bout to do to ya
We smash, leavin' you niggas without your nuts when we get through wit'cha
None of this shit is new to us, everybody keep doin' us
This is the era that my dogs created, they can't ruin us
Who be truer than us? I wonder what you might answer
These stupid hoes keep trying but don't come close
So they can't stand us
Stop tryna reprimand us
You niggas done lost yo' fuckin' mind, thinkin' you better
Just the thought of it is outlandish
I brandish an AK-47 then point it your way
"You dead" they say
I'm handing out beatdowns every single motherfuckin' day!
Stay on this thug shit, there's no other way to make it bubble
I just might make shit pop but y'all don't want that kind of trouble
It's subtle whenever I slip into this mind state, y'all in danger
When I rip niggas apart, nothing left of them remain
So I'mma continue to let these niggas have it, and show no mercy
You fuckin' with "one man army" opponents never could hurt me
I'm playin' thuggin' when I'm on a mission, they say "It ain't fair"
You niggas done had your warning
So why in the hell y'all have to take me there?
One thing you haters got fucked up about me, I ain't never scared
Come look me in my eyes and tell me if you see any fear
Still I'm that nigga from St. Clair, if you wanna question where I'm from
And where you from are them places that can't compare
You niggas ain't nothing but lessor, just walking dead as fuck
You're lucky to still be breathing my nigga but not for long, oh well
They finna get touched up heavily with this...
Touched up heavily with this rhythm, I'm givin' it to you raw
Hit 'em and niggas they feel it inside the dome as they broke off
Stack the 5th Dog, killing these hoes off softly, bitch now die slow
I send 'em to meet lil Deo, then they get sent to meet Diablo
Adios amigo, comprende? listen the way I say and slay
Nigga don't fuck around, see I'm serving these words I spray
Face it, nev'theless the fact ain't no escape, I chop your head
Pop it off your shoulder, then bury the head along with the hatchet
You niggas hardly expect it while you feel Flesh resurrection
Look at us sick and sore from stressing
Over the million dollar question: "Something new, something new
When they gon' come with something new?"
But Layzie, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh gon' come with something new
You niggas ain't never heard it like some Flesh and the rest of my crew
Since my niggas the most bitten, here goes some more they can chew

[Bridge]
High energy strong with the wisdom
Sense of a rich man, knowledge and the rhythm
This is what I'm using to come up with a style
So I'll interact altogether better with the crowd
(Bizzy Bone!)

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
Its the classical doc masterful savage rappers immacable
Average I spit it casual package it
What time is it? Niggas clock me, I'm cuckoo
Lose every muthafucking scruple
Nigga this Bizzy Bone, Google me internet style, YouTube
Hand it to Captain Kirk, I'm finna Cobain the Kool-Aid
Fuck what these fools say, I'm in the county, no food for 2 days
2 braids, a plastic bag of toothpaste and bullshit
First class to the crib, that's how them muthafucking shows is
Lean with it, Wayne's world
 (I like that; Come on, ha...)
Lean with it, Wayne's world
, Karma throw her theme with it
Seen with it, better be better than last year, king with it
She wanted Chris 19, and I put some dream in it
Now let me put that A in the middle, right where the seam splitted
Tell one of these niggas to pass the pump and let me take a toke
Red Hot Chili Pepper, my nigga that was a good joke
5 percent of thinkin' let me poof pow be gone
Rest in peace Chris Lighty; my nigga move on
'9-5 eternally, weed smoking most certainly
Black widow blew perfectly, talking Eazy through surgery
Supple with the serpent no slurping nobody fucks with me
Company on the move, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's back to loving me!?!
See these animals outta the jungle we never will struggle I pick up the
Ball and if one of us fumble I go to the gutter
And get all my hustle it's back to the booth
Nigga let's bubble lets get in a shuffle, let's get in a scuffle
I say that we rumble and rustle up niggas we doing a cypher
Dear Lord, let a nigga be humble
Y'all still don't understand, y'all rappin' fast
Stealin' my brand that's a whole new plan, man I'm just sayin'
You siphon nigga Iraqi style, 
duck a nigga like Pacquiao
Broke rappers get mad so fuck you niggas, with a cash smile
I'm asphalt, salient salts solvents and vaults
Crispy weed, jars full of joints, bars, niggas lost
Faded the 'Bron Cleveland play, Miami like Weezy stay
Get me the fuck up outta here
Cock the pump, slap the clip into the Glock and spit it fast so that I can get it, go with it
For the block, meet the coppers on the corner where they sell rocks
So fitted tight like a glove acquitted, I'm OJ Simpson
I'm Michael Jackson, I'm Lupe Fiasco
These muthafuckas don't understand me I'm flippin'
Threateningly leave the kitchen
Cooking these scriptures in liquids
Saut√©e that lettering in skillets of harmony
Spices, no cinnamon with one more element some rhythm and
Ritalin rippin' 'em, no vitamins, Biblical flowing like Gideon's
Clack back me pump, hollow point mixed wit dum-dum kickin'
Rappers that laying all over the floor, shut up and listen
It's a jack move, stalking gat fools,
 I got some bad news
We finna get at you
Kickin'...that's when we pass through
Tried to leave us out the cypher, let them thugs have a glass with you
Mash with you, five niggas rappin' with a passion, fast with you
Rocks that makes me flash with you, smash with you and at you too
Bone don't move 'til I ask you to
See my goons will smash half of this room if I ask them to
Before I leave, better ask my dudes:
Ain't we the coldest group ever?
Word to Eazy, nigga with attitudes
Cleveland city avenues
Crack house is the death of our mentalists
Momma lended a track and Wally my niggas
Shit grin, make me grin again, me and my niggas gettin' it in
Y'all finna be coasting to that same Bone shit again

[Interlude]
Nervous for a second, then the rest...
(Krayzie Bone!)
Murder murder kill kill redrum redrum

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
I come with a militant vision for all them niggas, that's ready for lyrical war
Finna do way more than just even the score
The thugs we come for blood, so guard your grill
We are the deal, we all real, y'all already know who that
They never seen a rapper like me that's relevant yet I'm considered a throwback
Call it classic swag
 it's Kray Action Jack
I pick up the mic and they all say "damn, bad man do that"
The game done studied me long time now, but it still can't seem to really get it
Niggas wicked, just admit it
My niggas the sickest with it
I pick up the pen and I go in like a surgeon
Verbally come to save a dying game 'cause it's hurtin'
I tell 'em to follow the leader
We keeping 'em stumbling, they better speed up
Y'all niggas can't tell me how this game don't need us, we up!
And get ball, first and ten, needing a touchdown once again
The game is over, niggas, once I'm in
I'm sneakin' up on 'em like I was the wind and blow 'em away
And shoo 'em the way
The fuck up outta here, the storm is coming today
And it's in the form of Kray
I tell 'em you should've been checked the forecast
I'm so bad, with the pen and the notepad I get up in your ass
So how in the hell is they doing the cypher
But never invited the illest spitters, realest niggas
Known to kick a little ass and after that, handle some business (Hey)
I figure they scared of the Thugs just cause we too real
Still runnin' with gats and bats and hoes you finna get hit with true steel
We one in a mill, we coming to kill 'em all
Less drama more music, so don't choose it
'Cause I got a pump and if it jump off I'm gon' use it
It's mister goddamn murderer, lyrically kill 'em permanent
And after I battle wit'chu, y'all gon' wanna forfeit the tournament
Competitors no concern in here
Heartbeat but it never did pump no fear
So thinkin' you finna come up in this bitch and just lean on me, that ain't fair
Sick of these lil' niggas running around like Bone ain't they daddy
Illegitimate bastard, some of them resemble me a little
But none of them get it like pappy
And tell your mammy I ain't payin' her nothing, so don't even ask me
Real nigga, I still keep my heat and crease my khakis
I'm finna get ill nigga take out your weapon 'cause nigga the beat done got me
They doubt me, but ask yourself just where would you be without me?
Been here 20 years, many years they still ain't ready for me
I'm constant run like the river nigga, I'm steady flowing
They tell me they love me, the way that I flip it or spit the harmony with it
Created the lane and step on this gas, so nigga don't bother me with it
They know that title belong to Bone
So nigga just leave it alone, and let us move on
I'm here with that Leather, my brotha, my niggas are sick with it
Real as it get with it
We on the mission to pick up the pieces and stick with it
Flow like I'm liquid, so slick with it
Roll with them niggas that used to be criminals
Now we just get in 'em lyrical
Niggas been acting like me and my niggas ain't good wit 'em now that the game went digital
Shame them niggas don't really know that we started it, fathered it, birthed it
We be the heart of it
So give me the beat, the melody really don't matter 'cause I'm killing all of it
I hit em up in they mind like a 9 [?] 'cause its
Murder murder kill kill redrum redrum redrum

[Bridge]
Let the lil' man get a piece, fuck everybody
I slap niggas first anyway, nigga
(Layzie Bone!)

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone]
Who want it with Layzie, nigga, fuck you, pay me
Been doing is since the '80s, early '80s
Nobody can fade me, my partner in rhyme is still Krayzie
And we finna break bread
The rest of them niggas got laid down and play dead
With Bizzy and Wish and Flesh, I roll on them niggas
I never did play fair
We represent St. Clair
The struggle the grind, the grit and the muscle
The First of the Month, Foe tha Love of the Money
That Grammy the shit
, that's how I hustle
Trust me, nope, them niggas don't want no trouble
Niggas be skeletons in my boneyard, trying to show hard
Nigga, I'll buck you, buck you
I cut like a Ginsu
Them niggas is going through what I done been through
I get in the cypher, I set niggas diapers on fire to show 'em what men do
They hut and attend to the order the generals call in the field
My 110 too, you're 50 percent and you claiming that real
Lay, that's why I'm hard to fade, Hall of Fame
Put me up in the Hall of Fame
Layzie Bone givin' you all the game
Y'all explain what's understood and never did have to be
Savagely I ravage beats, my money attracted magically
But I had the key, could've picked the lock, instead I chose to kick the door
Tragically it had to be for the ones that went form friend to foe
My thugs is indispensable, friendship is the principle
Boys to men to the end of the road, but Tha Crossroads not the pinnacle
It's a winner though, all original, it's history now I'mma make it stick
My nigga we 'bout to be Laker rich
That mystery murder man break a snitch
Taking trips, yep we party on plenty of acreage
The Bone be going for twenty years strong
Now how in the fuck can we fake this shit?
Bitch, yep I ride with 2 Glocks
Stick a rapper up for his new chain, hit 'em up like I'm 2Pac
Wanna do things? I move crowds cause that bang bang get too loud
Forever they callin' me young thug 'cause the unplugged is the new style now
Who in the fuck is claiming the best in the business
And where's the arena that niggas is playing in?
'Cause I'm 'bout to get wit 'em
I'm hearing king this, throne that
All the influenced Bone rap
Get ready my nigga we at it again, them other ones taking that long nap
Never met a click of five, mighty Mo Thug we still alive
FBG, yeah it's the life, Harmony Howse, and Seventh Sign
Perfect, nigga this A to Z and we workin'
Been around the globe with 
Steve Lo
' shouts out to Full Surface
Nigga it's your time, Go time, I'mma bust in the low mine
Dangerous like a gold mine, 
clickin' up like Voltron
Biatch! (laugh)
(Wish Bone!)

[Verse 5: Wish Bone]
Y'all niggas to quit that, this is real rap, y'all niggas need to sit back
Wanna learn a little somethin' from the teacher? I got that
Lyrical holder, spit fire, or smotherer, or get swolled up
I'm a grown man, with a life long plan, understand that?
It could go ugly, murders, how old do you think I am?
But I still got hands and I put 'em on ya
For the real rap era formula, I warned ya
Get missing, hood ceremony, got some ditches you bitches
At the same time, we move a life long hustle my niggas
Say sorry from the top, gotta lie, gotta have that money
Power, respect we earned that
Maintain twenty years in the game and Bone ain't done yet
You heard me, we ain't done yet
It ain't over 'til it's over, and it ain't over
Worst nightmare, don't you play with me
Or we can be partners, nigga, get money
Lamborghini dream, empty pocket realities, that's not for me, See me
We can part on the North Side, ride
And we gon' party on the East Side, ride
And we gon' party on the South Side, ride
We gonna keep it real in the West (West) for Eazy-E
Give me my shoes and I'mma run wit 'em
My story's far from the soft nigga, and I stand wit 'em
I got what you want and what you need
Only thing that makes me old school is this .38 snub
No clues, no fools, and plus my bad bitch she got [?] Ooh
It's amazing these niggas still playing, still praying
And all that's lost, especially the boss
And on that note, I'm lost
Y'all niggas go ahead and do this shit, I'm done
I love you Bri Bri
