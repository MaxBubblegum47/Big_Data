[Intro]
Yo, Bloodhound Gang and Rob Van Winkle together on this track

[Verse 1: Vanilla Ice]
Stop as we drop this bomb
Blow up this place like another Vietnam
Heavy like a Tyson blow to the dome
Back up son give me room give me room
To set it off like this don't give it up
I'm all up in you 'til you just can't get enough
Real hard to the bone you want more?
I sneak up on you like a sniper at your back door
Phat flavor for your brain you know the time
So check the wrath it's for real cause I'm gonna get mine
Roll up on you like Eastwood
Blowin' up fifteens as I'm ridin' through your neighborhood
I spreads butter like Parkay
Real smooth with the flow and even when I parlay
Do what you feel and check the skill
I'm in your grill peep this I got the raw deal
In your Jeep Cherokee or Land Cruiser
When you're rollin' through the hood you want use a
Track like this all up in your eardrum
So check the E.Q. and let them speakers hum
And gets crazy like Prozac
Hype enough to start a party and illy as a heart attack
Round one round two knock out
Straight to your head like my round never lights out

[Hook-Repeat 4x]
Tah rah tah rah tah rah boom dee
Tah rah tah rah tah rah boom dee a

[Verse 2: Jimmy Pop]
Jimmy Jimmy y'all Jimmy damn Jimmy yea
Gimme the mic Rob so I can take it away
Got more lines than the welfare office
Are you upset you'll never get to be as clever as this?
Spreadin' quicker than your mom have a feel but don't cop it
Yeah I stole your beat but that's cause you dropped it
Crude as oil unrefined but slick
I'm gonna get you from behind like a gay convict
Cause my name ain't Quasimodo but I still got a hunch
That like the Jim Jones cult I'll take you out with one punch
You're Spiro Agnew and I'm the Dick you answer to
You're sweatin' like a watermelon at a Baptist barbecue
Sneakin' up like celery yeah I'm stalkin'
I squeak like Stephen Hawking yeah but I'm walkin'
Nose to ground so this Bloodhound will sniff and follow it
I hope you choke on your pride when I make you swallow it
Screamin' like a Mimi when you see me comin' near ya
Like a Kenny Loggins' record no one's ever gonna hear ya
Like a game of Hide and Seek it's all over if I see ya
Cause you're yellower than tinkle and you'll be runnin' like diarrhea

[Hook 8x]
