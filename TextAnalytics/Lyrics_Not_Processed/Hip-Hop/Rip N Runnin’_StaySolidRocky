[Intro]
Times are runnin', rip n running we can't go back
I stopped taking Adderall but girl you know that
Thought you pulled up in the wagon, hope you drove that
Oppositions see I'm flaggin' we gon' [?] that

[Chorus: StaySolidRocky]
Pop off a pill, I too high I ain't even land yet
He in the fye, he in the sky, he devil dancin'
I don't reply, you bitches crying I ain't romantic (Uh uh)
Body bag a nigga, pick it up and slam it
You speak on rip, my finger flick, turn you to ashes
We on that shit, we train that bitch while we was back there
My lighter flick, I reminisce and get to loving
We, we just having fun, I hit and run like I just crashed it

[Verse 1: StaySolidRocky]
Fuck around and split it shit had that a boy a fraction
We gon' come and go, the Glock explode, it's leaving fragments
Nigga duck and pressure, walking carpets I got static
Throwin' thirty bullets hope your wide receiver catch it
Live life to the fullest I ain't emptying out glasses
I dropped out of school, no I ain't filling out these classes
Win another round and I'm receiving these advances
These niggas ain't make it cause they burning out like plastic

[Verse 2: Big4Keezy]
What the fuck, niggas know whats up
Choppa bust, old bitch like to fuck
Can't get cuffed, left em in the dust
I can't trust, guess I smell like must
Oh that's tough, perky pilot bust
Call my phone, hang that bitch right up
How if us, can't roll me in no blunt
Hermes, hit the whip, it a vet
Niggas mad, told that bitch "Oh my bad"
Solo slime by myself, I'm on they ass
Fuck that cash, we get down on your ass
I've been ballin' on these niggas, no Steve Nash

[Chorus: StaySolidRocky]
Pop off a pill, I too high I ain't even land yet
He in the fye, he in the sky, he devil dancin'
I don't reply, you bitches crying I ain't romantic (Uh uh)
Body bag a nigga, pick it up and slam it
You speak on rip, my finger flick, turn you to ashes
We on that shit, we train that bitch while we was back there
My lighter flick, I reminisce and get to loving
We, we just having fun, I hit and run like I just crashed it
