[Intro: 
Al Pacino
 & Rich The Kid]
I told you, man, I told you!
Don't fuck with me! I told you, no fucking kids!
No, but you wouldn't listen
Why, you stupid fuck?
Look at you now
Huh?
Money way, only way, y'know what I'm sayin'? (Ice way)
Lil' bitch!

[Chorus: Rich The Kid]
Was up trappin' early (Early)
She bad and bougie, but whippin' a birdie (Huh?)
My cup is so dirty (What?)
Your diamonds don't shine, my pinky a 30 (30)
Pour up the pint, that's so clean (So clean)
The rims of the Bentley cost 14 (Skrrt)
Ain't doin' no talkin', the red beam (Red beam)
My bitches bring bitches, young nigga, we flexin' (Huh?)

[Post-Chorus: Trippie Redd & 
Rich The Kid
]
Ayy, so much green on my street like it's Grove (
Whoa

Ayy, made a lot of money on the road (
Yuh
)
Ayy, now they book me, 10K for a show
Ayy, Actavis in my drink, I'ma pour, yeah

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]

I'ma beat her box, beatin' off her fuckin' socks

I be whippin' rocks, fiends hit me, they sniffin' rocks
I wuv Trippie Redd

Ayy, hope I don't crash, do the dash in a NASCAR
Ayy, it really is a fast car
It's a movie just like Pixar, movie just like Pixar
Get shot, I turn your ass into clip art
Yeah, I turn your ass into clip art
Boy, you is a retard, on the go just like a go-kart
Makin' art just like Mozart, art just like Mozart
