[Intro]
Who's that? Pinero
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I was countin' racks and you did chicken shop with bae
Boy, please behave, me and you are not the same
You don't come my way, why you got gun fingers? You don't aim
Oh, you think you're bad, look at your drip, it's got stains
I was countin' racks and you did chicken shop with bae
Boy, please behave, me and you are not the same
You don't come my way, why you got gun fingers? You don't aim
Oh, you think you're bad, look at your drip, it's got stains (Stains)

[Verse]
We're gonna get that guap, stack it in piles, call it Jenga (Brrt)
I do my ting, manage my squad, Arsene Wenger (Wenger)
Said he trappin' at night, movin' white, calls it Brenda (Uh)
All I see is liеs, porky pies, you pretendеr (Liar)
I like when a bunda's soft, golden brown, chicken tender
And I keep my unit tight, tape at night, only members (Members)
She look nice, caught my eye, then I remembered (Mm-hmm)
I provide for the fam, I ain't got time for benders
Some of my friends got IPP (Free them)
Doin' road is IC3 (My bruddas)
I like the glow of IVD (Ah, yeah)
Never made it to Ivy League (Uh-uh)
Can you leave us, CID? (Oi)
And let us live in peace (Peace)
We wanna make bread and watch sports on Sky TV (Dickheads)

[Chorus]
I was countin' racks and you did chicken shop with bae (Brrt)
Boy, please behave, me and you are not the same (Nope)
You don't come my way, why you got gun fingers? You don't aim (Put 'em down)
Oh, you think you're bad, look at your drip, it's got stains (Got stains)
I was countin' racks and you did chicken shop with bae (Brrt)
Boy, please behave, me and you are not the same (Nope)
You don't come my way, why you got gun fingers? You don't aim (Put it down)
Oh, you think you're bad, look at your drip, it's got stains

[Outro]
You got stains
