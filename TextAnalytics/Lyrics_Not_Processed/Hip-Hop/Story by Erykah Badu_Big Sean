[Spoken Word: Erykah Badu]
Here I am, Miss Badu
Not Big Sean, but I don't fuck with you
It's 'cause I'm from the D, the other D
But Detroit has a special place in my heart
Creative, deep, rooted, organic, cosmic
Fantastic, futuristic, ancient, musical
When I think of Detroit, I think of these things
There's something in that dirty water that gives it its flavor
There's an invisible intelligence that runs through the streets
Like an underground rooting system
Millions and billions of memory of atoms of all of the beautiful music that has been created there
And I've seen it еvolve into things only felt in the hеart
I know this to be true
Thank you, Berry Gordy, for that little house
Thank you, Stevie Wonder, for always calling me and reminding me that it is there
That thing
I always long to reconnect with it when I lose my way musically
Thank you, J Dilla, for your peculiar, peculiar intelligence
Yeah, Detroit just has a magic, and I know it to be true
Not Big Sean, but I don't fuck with you
