[Verse 1]
Do you know what it's like waiting for ya?
Then you apologize, but you never change at all
You know what you're doing to me, doing to me, doing to me
Do you know what it's like waiting for ya?
Why don't I save myself some time, why?

[Chorus]
Tell me why I keep going back
When I know I've been there, done that
Why do I keep missing you for messing up something, instead of letting go?
Tell me why I keep going back
When I know I've been there, done that
Keep on wanting something that won't change
Been there, done that
Been there, done that

[Verse 2]
You don't know what it's like loving someone
Got my heart at the back of your mind
No, I've never felt so small
Now you know what you're doing to me, doing to me, doing to me
You don't know what it's like loving someone
Why don't I save myself some time, why?

[Chorus]
Tell me why I keep going back
When I know I've been there, done that
Why do I keep missing you for messing up something, instead of letting go?
Tell me why I keep going back
When I know I've been there, done that
Keep on wanting something that won't change
Been there, done that
Been there, done that

[Bridge]
Just let me go
If you don't know me, no, go

[Chorus]
Tell me why I keep going back
When I know I've been there, done that
Why do I keep missing you for messing up something, instead of letting go?
Tell me why I keep going back
When I know I've been there, done that
Keep on wanting something that won't change
Been there, done that
Been there, done that
Tell me why I keep going back
When I know I've been there done that
Keep on wanting something that won't change
Been there, done that
