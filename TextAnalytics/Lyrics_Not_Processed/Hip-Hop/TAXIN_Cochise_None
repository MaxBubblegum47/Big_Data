I had to double the racks (The racks)
The FN, it cost 'bout a sack (A sack)
My brother just flew down a pack
I done had to tell 'em relax (Relax)
I done had to take out the packs
I done had to buy out the max, ayy
And no, I don't have any tax (Yeah)
I done had to come with the hat (Hat)
Uh-huh, let me get that check (That check)
Uh-huh, let me get that rack (That rack)
Uh-huh, let me break yo' neck (Your neck)
Uh-huh, let me get that cash (Uh-huh)
Countin' money to the ceiling
Shawty, she catching the feelings
Just like a book, I am reading
Shawty, she looking appealing (Uh)
All in my bag, hustle (Yeah)
Me and my cash, couples, uh
Me and my racks double
Heard they watching me just like huddle
 (Uh, uh)
And I'm sharing my chips like it's Ruffles
That boy wanna be me, talking bumble
He get wet on the street like a puddle
Just like Wukong, I stay in the jungle, huh
I don't think they like me
Heard they wanna fight me
I be rocking Nike
I heard he rapping on my type beats
I feel like Gucci 'cause I might be
Movie I'm Spike Lee
In a cut in the trap in a white tee
This Cochise ain't doing biting
While you in the trap, I'm in the store
I'm in the racks, I make it pour
Want a umbrella from Christian Dior
No I don't wanna go to any tour
God on my side and he blessing me more
Stick 'em up, we about to rob in the store
It don't even matter if you rich or you poor
I don't wanna hear a word, put ya hands on the floor
They tryna know where I get that
I cannot say where I get that
Walk around holding them big sacks
Yeah I walk in, I'm holding the big racks
That's my style, need my lil' fit back
I need healing I bought me a stimpak
I'ma double the beat like a Ringtax
I might blow on the beat like a Semtex
Ya government cheese, huh
I want a house in the Keys, huh
I want a car with no keys, huh
I had to pray on my knees, huh
God on my side, never leave
