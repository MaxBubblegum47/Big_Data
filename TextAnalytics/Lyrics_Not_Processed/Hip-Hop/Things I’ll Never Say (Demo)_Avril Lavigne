[Verse 1]
I’m tugging at my hair
I’m pulling at my clothes
I’m trying to keep my cool, I know it shows
I’m staring at my feet
My cheeks are turning red
I’m searching for the words inside my head

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I’m feeling nervous
Tryna be so perfect
'Cause I know you’re worth it
You’re worth it, yeah

[Chorus]
If I could say what I wanna say
I'd say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?
If I could say what I wanna see
I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I’m wishing my life away with these things I’ll never say

[Verse 2]
It don’t do me any good
It’s just a waste of time
What use is it to you what’s on my mind?
If it ain’t coming out
We’re not going anywhere
So why can’t I just tell you that I care?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I’m feeling nervous
Tryna be so perfect
'Cause I know you’re worth it
You’re worth it, yeah

[Chorus]
If I could say what I wanna say
I'd say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?
If I could say what I wanna see
I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I’m wishing my life away with these things I’ll never say

[Bridge]
What’s wrong with my tongue?
These words keep slipping away
I stutter, I stumble
Like I’ve got nothing to say

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I’m feeling nervous
Tryna be so perfect
'Cause I know you’re worth it
You’re worth it, yeah

[Final Chorus]
If I could say what I wanna say
I'd say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?
If I could say what I wanna see
I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I’m wishing my life away with these things I’ll never say
If I could say what I wanna say
I'd say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?
If I could say what I wanna see
I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I’m wishing my life away with these things I’ll never say

[Outro]
These things I’ll never say
