[Verse 1: Dylan Minnette]
I know you so well
You know that I can tell the slightest difference in your facial expression
Don't tell me nothing's on your mind
If we're honest, it will all be fine
I'm someone who likes to talk things through
The hardest thing is getting it out of you
I should sit back and give you a break
Let you close your perfect eyes

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette]
'Cause there's no need to explain
I know what you want to say (Ooh)
We could just say, "Goodnight", if you think that's alright
There's no need to explain
I know that we can relate
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Okay

[Verse 2: Dylan Minnette]
I'm getting too close
You say you love me most
It's hard to trust it even though I want to
Need to get this shit out of my head
Before I flip this on myself instead
Please come over here
Lay your head right down
Don't make a sound
I hear you loud and clear

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette]
There's no need to explain
I know what you want to say
We could just say, "Goodnight", if you think that's alright
There's no need to explain
I know that we can relate
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Okay

[Bridge: Dylan Minnette]
If we know we love each other, what's the concern?
Found with or without separation is what I've learned
I'd wait for an hour, or I'd wait for a year
Is your opinion on it something I want to hear?
I know you never lie, but I self-sabotage
I know your love isn't just a mirage
But I tend to panic if I can't reach out and grab it
I need to get out all these bad habits

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette]
There's no need to explain
I know what you wanna say
'Cause you say, "Goodnight"
If you think that's alright
There's no need to explain
I know that we can relate
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Can we get up and try to feel okay again? (Hey)

[Outro: Dylan Minnette]
We can get up and try to feel okay again
We can get up and try to feel okay again
Okay
