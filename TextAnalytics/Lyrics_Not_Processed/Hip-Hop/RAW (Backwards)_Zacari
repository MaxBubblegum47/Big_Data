[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
What’s happenin'? Another baptism by Pastor Black Lip
I'm mashin' across the masses, my movement massive
I'm low-key, like a locksmith workin' on both knees
You nosy, wiretap vans,
 
got fur where my toes be
I'm cozy,
 
act like you know me
Wicked as Aleister Crowley,
 
I just might OD
Overly dedicated, just like my homie
Second to none in the first place, I need a trophy
Doing whatever I please, it's like, "Fuck your feelings!"
Man, I got so many flows, them shits come with ceilings
What's my name? They call me Ab-Soul, the Abstract Asshole
I'm levitatin', way too crazy
Way too wavy for your sandcastle

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
Ayy, man, what’s happenin'?
Another baptism by Pastor Black Lip
I'm mashin' across the masses, my movement massive
The Backwoods with the gas in it
You roll the raw, I spell it backwards
Throw that wack shit up in the trash can

[Post-Chorus: Zacari]
We don't wanna hear that wack shit no more
No more
No more, no more
No more, no more

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I'm goin' loco, this nigga Soulo back in this ho though
Oh no, you watchin' Hulu, I run the show though
Is it music? Voodoo? I don't know
But don't confuse me with D'Angelo, I'm the angel though
Spooky,
 
hope your army got lots of armor
‘Cause we don't die, we just multiply, divide and conquer
Remember when the Battle Mongers called me a reject
'Til I had all this heart and honor, demand my respect
Now I walk through C-A-R-son like I'm a hero
Steps ahead and stackin' bread up, speakin' of heroes
4-7 shit, fuck it, fly to the Beast Coast
Just to sag down Troy Ave quotin' King Steelo
Pass the pot, let me skillet
The temperature is scaldin', the novices make me nauseous
I was like a swami of Jay Electronica until he figured
Dizzle wouldn't admit that he would body him for a milli
I told Kenny keep quiet, I'ma get him
We don't need dirt on your hands, gettin' the key to the city
You feel me? Hurts when your OG
Who's supposed to be a G-O-D
Is standin' next to King Kunta feelin' like Toby
Yeah, Moos, what I gotta do, boy?
I'm just waitin' on your cue to take him to school, boy
Yeah
, but fuck all this wordplay
Top, tell these fuckin' stooges I'm dangerous, keep away
Mayday (Soul!)

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
Ayy, man, what’s happenin'?
Another baptism by Pastor Black Lip
I'm mashin' across the masses, my movement massive
The Backwoods with the gas in it
You roll the raw, I spell it backwards
Throw that wack shit up in the trash can

[Post-Chorus: Zacari]
We don't wanna hear that wack shit no more
No more
No more, no more
No more, no more

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers
Raw backwards on all you rappers

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
I’m Wiccan like a wicked witch, I need Alia Zin
To read Genesis, yeah
‘Cause this one for my fellow Thelemites about that fuckin' life
You fuckin' right, I need to stand up for my fuckin' rights
Out of sight, out of mind
, 
still leave insight in your brain
Got your synapses doin' jumping jacks and all kind of things
I mean check my subject range
Agartha
, 
dopamine
, 
choppers, stick talk,
 
Benihana, PF Chang's
Revelations reiterated,
 this revolutionary
Shit you bump that gives you goosebumps
‘Cause the truth is scary
(Do what thou wilt)
 
I’m not talented, I’m skilled
(I’m the darkest knight) With the shiniest shield
Would’ve attended a university, but it was silly to me
Because the whole universe is just a city to me
