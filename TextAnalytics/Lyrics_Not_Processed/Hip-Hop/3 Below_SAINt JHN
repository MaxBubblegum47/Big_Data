[Intro]
I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below

[Chorus]
Saint Laurent and Quarter Water
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter
'Cause I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below

[Verse 1]
Gucci slippers girl you poppin', ya know
The way you look I know you got them niggas flockin'
And you got them Rihanna dreads
Now you deserve a nigga with a Kawasaki, ouu

[Chorus]
Saint Laurent and Quarter Water, ya' know
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter, oh
I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below

[Verse 2]
You know I like them ratchet bitches, ya know
You know I tell her suck it 'fore she ask permission, oh
You know I make 'em all audition, oh
Four naked bitches this is New Edition, oh
I was out here ridin' round, ya know
I was only juggin' on my part of town, oh
I'm gon' need you quiet now, oh
Know you see me ballin' don't go out of bounds, oh

[Chorus]
Saint Laurent and Quarter Water
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter
'Cause I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below

[Verse 3]
Girl you got a bright future, ouu
Damn you look nice girl, the lights suit ya
I prefer you naked
If your head's good you'll make a nice tutor
I don't mean no disrespect, no
But I prefer Shaniqua over Elizabeth
Me, I like them ratchet bitches, oh
Only hit her once a year, that's after Christmas, yeah

[Chorus]
Saint Laurent and Quarter Water, ya' know
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter, oh
'Cause I ain't tryna' be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below
Saint Laurent and Quarter Water, ya' know
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter, oh
'Cause I ain't tryna' be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below

[Outro]
Ooh oh, ooh oh, ooh oh
3 below zero, ya' know
Ooh oh, ooh oh, ooh oh
3 below zero, ya' know
