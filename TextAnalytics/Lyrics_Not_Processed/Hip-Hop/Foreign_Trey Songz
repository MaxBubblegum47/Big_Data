[Intro]
That foreign, that foreign
That foreign, that foreign
That foreign, uh huh
Trigga

[Verse 1]
Colombian, oh yeah I love that
I love her if she speak another language
She be doing things I never seen
I think I might have hit it in my dreams
She drop it, then she throw it, yeah she work it
I seen your Instagram but you look better up in person
I think her booty fake, she say it's real though
She back it up and let me get my feel on

[Pre-Chorus]
She only been here for two weeks
Came with the girls and they tryna leave with me
She working hard like she tryna get a visa
The way she twerk it, I just might pull out my Visa

[Chorus]
After we leave girl, you know where you going
Straight to the 'tel, you ain't leaving 'til the morning
Same old thing, yeah, you know that shit's boring
American you know I had to cop that foreign
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She got in that bikini when we in the Lamborghini
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She from another country, I brought her to the city with me
I know it's never boring
American you know I had to cop that foreign, uh huh

[Verse 2]
I hit the lot and then I leave out with a new one
Her ass so fat, I measure that, I tote a ruler
People wanna ask why I walk like that, don't wonder, make that pussy rain when I bring that thunder
Shoutout Australia when she go down under

[Pre-Chorus]
She only been here for two weeks
Came with the girls and they tryna leave with me
She working hard like she tryna get a visa
The way she twerk it, I just might pull out my Visa

[Chorus]
After we leave girl, you know where you going
Straight to the 'tel, you ain't leaving 'til the morning
Same old thing, yeah, you know that shit's boring
American you know I had to cop that foreign
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She got in that bikini when we in the Lamborghini
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She from another country, I brought her to the city with me
I know it's never boring
American you know I had to cop that foreign, uh huh

[Verse 3]
And she be like "Ay que rico" when I'm going real deep though
You can give me all of them besos, just stay low, do what I say so
Fuck me now, oh shit, excuse my French but I got a bad bitch
And she ain't from France but she french kiss dick and she ain't got plans 'cause they get dismissed

[Bridge]
She only been here for two weeks, for two weeks
A different party every night, she like to drink, she love to drink
Body language is all she's tryna speak
That's okay, that's alright, go all day, go all night, I'ma beast

[Chorus]
After we leave girl, you know where you going
Straight to the 'tel, you ain't leaving 'til the morning
Same old thing, yeah, you know that shit's boring
American you know I had to cop that foreign
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She got in that bikini when we in the Lamborghini
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She from another country, I brought her to the city with me
I know it's never boring
American you know I had to cop that foreign
