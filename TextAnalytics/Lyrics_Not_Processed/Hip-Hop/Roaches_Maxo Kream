[Chorus]
Remember roaches in my ashtray and roaches in my cereal
Airforce knockoffs with the Gucci print material
Way before the iPhones, Twitter, 'Gram socials
I'm talkin' 'bout nextel chirps and Boost mobiles
Back when the face tatts was for OG killas
Now I'm seein' tear drops on you Soundcloud niggas
Remember back when music had content and metaphors
Way before the mumble nonsense and poppin' handlebars

[Verse 1]
All these rappers junkies talkin' like they dope dealers
One song a scammer, the next song they killers
First time I shot the gun, the neighbors called the people
I was watchin' 12 search for shells like Easter
That's around the time they shot my Daddy for the Rollie
Round the same time AI lost to Kobe
Platinum FUBU summers, rockin' Iceberg in the winter
Gold bag Hermes ain't no Sprewell Spinners
Fuckin' up computers, usin' Limewire or BearShare
Bootleggin', boostin', sellin' CD's at the daycare
Savin' up guala, bean bag for my stash spot
Momma still ask me how the fuck I get that Xbox
Round the first time I saw my uncle smokin' crack rock
In The Flinstones, smokin' Pebbles like it's Bedrock
'Round the same time my pops was scammin' on that laptop
Still remember when my Uncle Sydney took that headshot
I was tryna get them Jordan 17, deadstocks
Used to hoop dream, pushin' rock on the blacktop
Started home invadin', kickin' combination padlock
Puttin' crack rock in the Figure-4 Leg Lock
I was hella young, watchin' Triple H & Ric Flair
Bust my head open play fightin' with a steel chair
Tryna be a wrassler almost put me in a wheelchair
Thankful for that Medicare welfare, healthcare

[Chorus]
Remember roaches in my ashtray and roaches in my cereal
Airforce knockoffs with the Gucci print material
Way before the iPhones, Twitter, 'Gram socials
I'm talkin' 'bout Nextel chirps and Boost mobiles
Back when a face tat was for OG killas
Now I'm seein' tear drops on you Soundcloud niggas
Remember back when music had content and metaphors
Way before the mumble nonsense and poppin' handlebars

[Verse 2]
Nowadays I can't even walk in the store
Without these crazy-ass fans and boppin-ass hoes
Back in '04, a hoe said I wouldn't blow
Now every show I go? 3 or 4 give me dome
I was up in Vegas at the Mayweather party
Then my mama call me 'bout Hurricane Harvey
Said the house got flooded, water covered up the sofa
Impala, Range Rover, she need me to come over
Nowhere near sober, it was fuckin' up my night
Like, "They gon' be alright. Tomorrow, book a flight"
Woke up, 40 missed calls, she was callin' all night
Said there's no more food and lights and she been fightin' for her life
Told Toby book the plane, I gotta be there by tonight
But all this hurricane rain made the airport cancel flights
I'm like, "What the fuck how?", I'm thinkin' like "Wow"
Prayin' that she don't drown.. "Dear Lord, just get her out"
She worked her whole life to move the family out the hood
Just to lose everything she had in the flood
Donald Trump and Red Cross actin' like some hoes
People drownin' in their homes 'cause they couldn't get a boat
Pops got a bad heart, last year he had a stroke
In his bed, off meds, couldn't swim, sink, or float
On the roof for three days before rescue by FEMA
12 years later, same day as Katrina
If you was in my shoes, you would prolly be stressin'
..But sometimes, God, He will bless you and test you
Every day I say my grace because I coulda lost my people
I still got cases, me and my brothers fightin' RICO
600K for the bail bonds people
Another 100K, I pray my lawyer got the cheat code
Organized crime.... dope and money launder
Five to 99 and that's they only offer
