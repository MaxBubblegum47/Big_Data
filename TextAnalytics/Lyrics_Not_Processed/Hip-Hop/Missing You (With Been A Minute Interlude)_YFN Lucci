[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning with you on my mind
She say she dont miss me, i know that she lying
I can see straight through that girl like a window no blinds
Yeah, all that fronting don't get left behind
I said girl stop that frontin, let me get behind
I used to have that girl running, like she bout her miss her ride
Had her screamin like when she terrified
She got that water im talking purified, oohh
Do you remember those nights
We was fussin and fightin, then be fuckin all night
I know you remember those night
Can't forget not a night, with me, alright
I put that pussy on me she love when i kiss her
And its some bout them rings she got in her nipples
I miss her, i miss her, i miss her, i miss
I will always remember her like a riddle
Still think about the things i did to her
I can't wait to get off this tour
Imma fuck you on the bed then the floor
In the shower have you pinned to the wall, yeahh

[Chorus]
I said answer me girl
Do you ever dream of me?
I need answers

[Verse 2]
She say she love the way that i kiss on her neck
Grab her hair and hit it from the back
Say girl don't you love when we attach
And she know i don't tolerate no disrespect

[Bridge]
I say you better answer me girl
Imma need answers right now
I say you better answer me girl

[Verse 3]
Scrolling down my call log
They say all men are all dogs
Who give a damn when they all call
Drop them panties like a sprint call
See they say hoes be ya downfall
I still get in they mouth like some damn halls
See they talkin bout us nigga damn yall
I got her ripping and running through these damn malls
See she can get anything he just gotta call
If anything she ain't never telling me no
Three songs she ain't even count me out yeah
It was 3 some I ain't even pull out
She say she love the way that I kiss on her neck
Grab her hair and hit her from the back
Say girl don't you love when we attach
And she know ion tolerate no disrespect
I say you better answer me girl
Imma need answers right now

[Chorus]
I say you better answer me girl, right now
I say answer me girl
Do you ever dream of me?
I need answers
Yeahh

[Been A Minute Interlude]

[Verse 1]
Well, everybody know the truth hurts
Everybody get played
Everybody fuck around, hate to say it
But you know I had to do it first
Baby girl, I tried to give you the universe
Don’t you really love the feeling when you feeling her
When shit got bad, you started giving up
Started acting like it never was never us

[Verse 2]
Well it was what it was
Heard I was replaced with a scrub
Heard you in love
Her love ain’t meant for a thug
Heard from a friend that you miss how I fuck
Dropping her off, and I’m picking her up
Laughing at him cause he thinking he cuffed
(Like what the fuck?)
Don’t be thinking you cuffed

[Verse 3]
Girl, it’s been a minute
I must admit that I missed it
If I broke your heart, let me fix it
If I said that you got my heart, then I meant it
Oh, how I love how you are independent
Life is amazing as long as you’re in it
Yeah, as long as you in it
I’m gonna keep on winning

[Verse 4]
She wanna love me
Ain’t ready for love
Her love ain’t meant for a thug
It ain’t meant for a thug

[Outro]
She wanna love me
Can’t keep fooling with her
She say don’t forget what we was
I won’t forget what we was yeah
She wanna love me
I ain’t ready for love
Damn, she say she fell into love with me
Well, ain’t ready for love
I ain’t ready for love, hell no
