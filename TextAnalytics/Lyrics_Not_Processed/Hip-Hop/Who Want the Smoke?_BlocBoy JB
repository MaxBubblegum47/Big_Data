[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I-I-I hear shots comin' on the low from hoes I'm higher than
This attention is so flatterin' 'cause they're admirin'
Don't know what's on their mind, but it should be retirement
Get the AARP or this AR get to firin' (Blat)
They don't want smoke with me (No), the diamonds is chokin' me
Their pussy need potpourri
, these bitches is 0-3
And there ain't a lower league, all in my ovaries
The fur on my shoulder mink, tell me what Hov would think
I get the money, I am the king of New York
And I rock a sew-in weave (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
I run it, I run it, I relay the win
They talkin', they talkin', I'm takin' it in
I did not come here to make me new friends
Who buried the bridge and aren't makin' amends (Ah)
They don't want none, I'll say it again (Yee)
They don't want none, I pray for their sins (Hah)

Is you fuckin'? (Yeah)
Baby girl, I need to know (Who?)
Who finna run get the rubbers from the store? (Who there?)
Bitch so damn wet, drippin' on my marble floor (Drip, drip, drip)
Never not strapped, in my city, on my soul
Pull up in a two-seater (Yeah), in a wife-beater
With my bro, he be bangin' like a car speaker
All black, late night like the Grim Reaper
Wrist in the air, turned the club to a new freezer (Ice)

[Verse 3: Offset]
Glock 40 in my coat (Glock)
My bitch keep fire in the Chanel tote (Fire, fire)
Suffocate him, hang him by the rope
Hot potato, bullet, let it go (Brrt, brrt, brrt)
The .44 put him in a yolk (.44)
Pull up in the stolo, look like he seen a ghost
And I got the kilo comin' on the boat (Kilo)
We gon' move it fast, vámonos, vámonos (Vámonos)
Niggas talkin' foul on the d-low (Foul)
Technical, I'm standin' at the line, shoot a free throw
Medical, I sip a couple lines of fineto
Impeccable, the Richard Mille line, man, it's see-through (Impeccable)
Who want the smoke? Wet him up, humble up
Seen the Ghost and they know, got a scope and I hope
That they pull up to the spot with the ho
Get smoked with the pole in the middle of the store (Smoke)
The SIG pulled out, nigga had a stroke
Coolant at them niggas, shawty, I don't know (Who?)
Choppa made that bitch (Bah), ain't nowhere to go
Throw him off the boat (Die), in the river, float (Float)
30 round clip in this clip clear (Clear)
I'm in the Wraith so I'm lookin' at the rear mirror (Mirror)
Free jit, we ain't goin' for that shit, period (Free jit)
Red dots on their pussy, niggas on their period (Hey, hey)
