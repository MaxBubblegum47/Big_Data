[Intro: blackbear]
Yeah

[Verse 1: blackbear]
My knees is hurt, 'cause I can't stand you bitches
I see right through you hoes, I got that tunnel vision
I bought a brand new rug, it cost me five whole digits
I spilled two pints and threw it out, all good, I sell it, I don't sip it
Can't remember last time I was dressed, like, oh, no, no
I hit up Y2K, I don't fuck with my plug no more
Y'all run like Windows 95, y'all hard as Microsoft
And no, I won't buy you a Rollie, girl, you tick me off

[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
I'm all like, "Listen girl, my brain is small as fuck
But I got a lotta bread, my pockets really dumb"
I'm all like, "Listen girl, I'm really tryna fuck
I don't wanna play these games, I just wanna go dumb, go dumb"

[Chorus: blackbear]
Dumb, dumb, dumb
I'm just tryna go so stupid, I don't need the convolution
I wanna go dumb, go dumb
It's not that deep, I do not need this damn confusion

[Verse 2: Bankrol Hayden]
Yeah, I said, "What's up, my name is Bankrol"
I was broke, ain't have no cable
Now she dancin' for my payroll
Come on stage, she grab my ankle
Love her body and her angles
Two door shotty, strap in the party, shawty, I'm sorry
'Cause I cannot fold on my brother, bitch
These days and these hoes on some other shit
Can't cuff her 'cause I got another bitch (Yeah)
Can't fuck her 'til I got a rubber, bitch
Put that on my brother, my brother, my brother
But then he gon' switch for a bitch (Switch)
And she call me dumb, so she give me brain
And now I feel smart as shit

[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
I'm all like, "Listen girl, my brain is small as fuck
But I got a lotta bread, my pockets really dumb"
I'm all like, "Listen girl, I'm really tryna fuck
I don't wanna play these games, I just wanna go dumb, go dumb"

[Chorus: blackbear]
Dumb, dumb, dumb
I'm just tryna go so stupid, I don't need the convolution
I wanna go dumb, go dumb
It's not that deep, I do not need this damn confusion

[Verse 3: The Kid LAROI]
I'm confused, what you want me to do?
Bitch, don't tell me that you love me, we both know that isn't true
You say I got all these hoes but I know you got others too
Yeah, I'll be right here on my own until you come tell me the truth
Conversations in my head, thinkin' 'bout what I shoulda said
And I know you're still around, but, oh, girl, took me a day
And I know you sit at night when you're alone and you're in your bed
Thinkin' 'bout just what we coulda been

[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
I don't wanna play these games, I just wanna go dumb, go

[Chorus: blackbear]
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
I'm just tryna go so stupid, I don't need the convolution
I wanna go dumb, go dumb
It's not that deep, I do not need this damn confusion
I wanna go dumb, dumb, dumb
I'm just tryna go so stupid, I don't need the convolution
I wanna go dumb, go dumb
It's not that deep, I do not need this damn confusion
