[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & 
Childish Gambino

All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some...
All she needed was some

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
At a Clippers game on the courtside (Side)
Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five (Five)
They mad at me too, I got more fire
When these bitches see you "Go home, Roger"
(
Go home, Roger
)
Tia and Tamera in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid (Nah)
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate,
 
instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys, and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from?
 
We were playing PlayStation
Why you standing there? Say some
Girl, say some
, 
no, this ain't a vacation
This is my house, my house
, all she needed was some

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & 
Childish Gambino
]
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some...
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga
Wanna take shots? AK, nigga
When I ball, I'ma ball, King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around
When you wanna play pool or my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a ménage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I, I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I, I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors...

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & 
Childish Gambino
]
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)
All she needed was some 
(All she needed was some)

[Outro: Childish Gambino &

Oh gosh, oh my God
 
(
All she needed was some
)
Oh my God
 
(
All she needed was some
)
Know tonight, our neighbors
 
(
All she needed was some
)
Are all alone, no no, no no no no no
 
(
All she needed was some
)
