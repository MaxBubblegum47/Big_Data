[Verse 1]
Been sleeping over for the past couple of weeks
Making a habit out of it, yeah
When I woke up, I saw your toothbrush on the sink
It kinda scared me, I'll admit

[Pre-Chorus]
If there's a line, then I think that we crossed it
Second time you stayed the night
If there's a cool, then I think that I lost it
And I should take my own advice

[Chorus]
Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-messy
Let's stop before it gets h-h-h-h-heavy
It's not too late to say you never met me
Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-m-m-messy

[Verse 2]
I try to tell myself "you gotta take it slow"
I always jump in way too fast, yeah
If you wake up and I'm not there, it's nothing personal
Just got some problems from my past, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
If there's a line, then I think that we crossed it
Second time you stayed the night
If there's a cool, then I think that I lost it
And I should take my own advice

[Chorus]
Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-messy
Let's stop before it gets h-h-h-h-heavy
It's not too late to say you never met me
Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-m-m-messy

[Bridge]
Messy
To say you never met me, messy
Before it gets (m-m-m-m-m-m-messy)

[Pre-Chorus]
If there's a line, then I think that we crossed it
Second time you stayed the night
If there's a cool, then I think that I lost it
And I should take my own advice

[Chorus]
Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-messy
Let's stop before it gets h-h-h-h-heavy
It's not too late to say you never met me
Let's stop before it gets m-m-m-m-m-m-messy
