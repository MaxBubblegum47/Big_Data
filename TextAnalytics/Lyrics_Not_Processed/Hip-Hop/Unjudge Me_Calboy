[Intro: Calboy]
What up, Super?
Don't say you love me
Yeah, yeah
This shit get ugly
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah

[Chorus: Calboy]
They judge me, but they don't know that I been broke
And I'm just hustling (I'm just hustling), and I grip this nine, don't lose your mind
I kill 'em, trust me (I kill 'em, trust me), and these niggas fu' and bitches change
So I'm not trusting (I'm not trusting), don't say you love me
This shit get ugly, so I grip this nine, don't lose your mind
I kill 'em, trust me, and these niggas fu' and bitches change
So I'm not trusting (I'm not trusting) all these bitches, they like honesty
So I'm not trusting, don't say you love me, this shit get ugly

[Verse 1: Calboy]
I remember days of livin' broke (Of livin' broke)
I remember sleepin' on the flo' (Sleepin' on the flo')
Tell my brothers, "Ain't no losin' hope" (No losin' hope)
All my friends are dead and they old (And they old)
What you need? I ain't trippin', bitch, I got it (Bitch, I got it)
We might catch 'em slippin', then it's tragic (Then it's tragic)
Reach up to the stars, gotta have it (Gotta have it)
We was six deep on a mattress (On a mattress)
On the ten-speed, that was traffic (That was traffic)
Now I got a Lambo tint, speedin' in traffic (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I'm not what you need, I'm a savage (I'm a savage)
I sing to my fully automatic, yeah (Automatic)

[Chorus: Calboy]
They judge me, but they don't know that I been broke
And I'm just hustling (I'm just hustling), and I grip this nine, don't lose your mind
I kill 'em, trust me (I kill 'em, trust me), and these niggas fu' and bitches change
So I'm not trusting (I'm not trusting), don't say you love me
This shit get ugly, so I grip this nine, don't lose your mind
I kill 'em, trust me (I kill 'em, trust me), and these niggas fu' and bitches change
So I'm not trusting (I'm not trusting) all these bitches, they like honesty
So I'm not trusting (I'm not trusting), don't say you love me, this shit get ugly

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
I been broke to the point I don't even wan' breathe no more (I was at my lowest)
Stealin' out the store, sleepin' on my cousin floor (Remember?)
Now I'm up, it feel like everybody give a fuck (Since when?)
I was lookin' for some love, but I ain't get enough (Back then)
They don't wanna see me win (Nope), now they ask if I remember
Now you gotta meet me again (Nope), thought I'd never leave the country
All these felonies (Federal), scared to hit licks with niggas
'Cause they might bail on me (Nope), or worse, tell on me (Yup)
Man, this shit get ugly (It do), I been through some shit
You might not wanna love me (I'm heartless), outlaw, screamin' "Thug Life"
Only God can judge me, this for all the hoes that played around
When I was dusty (Bitch), didn't wanna fuck me (Fuck me)

[Chorus: Calboy]
They judge me, but they don't know that I been broke
And I'm just hustling (I'm just hustling), and I grip this nine, don't lose your mind
I kill 'em, trust me (I kill 'em, trust me), and these niggas fu' and bitches change
So I'm not trusting (I'm not trusting), don't say you love me
This shit get ugly, so I grip this nine, don't lose your mind
I kill 'em, trust me (I kill 'em, trust me), and these niggas fu' and bitches change
So I'm not trusting (I'm not trusting) all these bitches, they like honesty
So I'm not trusting (I'm not trusting), don't say you love me, this shit get ugly, yeah
