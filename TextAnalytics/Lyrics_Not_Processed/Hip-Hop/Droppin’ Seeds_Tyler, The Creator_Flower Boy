[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Mula!

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Like Adam in the Garden of Eden
My bitch got an apple bottom and she swallow my seeds
Follow my lead, fire I breathe, water my seed
And sit back and watch money grow on trees
Droppin' seeds like classes, these hoes drop they asses
I drop a seed in her panties if it smell like pansies
I'm a banshee in her panties, nigga, ask your mammy
Never played golf, but got a driver and a Caddy
Whole squad slammin' like Onyx, you know Sticky Fingaz
Some drop science, I'm droppin' English
Even if Tyler named the song "Flower"
No seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs
I'm down

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Lil Wayne]
Droppin' seeds on these niggas, they can't fuck with the boy (Mula!)
I'm droppin' seeds on these bitches for the love of the sport
I'm droppin' seeds, got this garden, flowers poppin' of course
I'm droppin' seeds, motherfucker, Weezy Baby the boy, yugh!
