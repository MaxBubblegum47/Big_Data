[Spoken Word: Paul McCartney]
Lets hope this one turns out pretty darn good huh?

[Verse 1]
You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me

[Chorus]
I'm down
I'm down
I'm down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
When you know I'm down

[Verse 2]
Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Same old thing happen everyday

[Chorus]
I'm down
I'm down
I'm down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
When you know I'm down?

[Guitar solo & McCartney shouts]

[Verse 3]
We're all alone and there nobody else
You still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"

[Chorus]
I'm down
I'm down
I'm down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?

[McCartney barks]
Keep going

[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm down
Oh yes, I'm down
Oh don't you know I'm down?
I'm down, yeah
I'm down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Wow, I'm down
Oh baby, I'm down
I'm down on the ground
I'm down
Woo, I'm hyeah
I'm down, and I'm a downer
I'll be a downer, and I'm a downer
Well yes I'm down, ow

[Spoken Word: Paul McCartney]
Ay its gonna be a goo-
Plastic soul, man, plastic soul
Plastic soul man
