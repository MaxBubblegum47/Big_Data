[Verse 1: YUNG PLAGUE]
Bitch, I'm Yung Plague with the AK steady sinning
Fuck life, and everything that fucking comes with it
Put the barrel in my mouth, blow my fucking brains out
I don't give a fuck about anything, now I'm finished
Never killed a motherfucker, but that's 'bout to fucking change
Throw my ass in jail, and just let me fucking decay
The world is fucking grey, I grip the fucking blade
And carve a line across my neck, and now I'm fucking saved

[Verse 2: CHARLES LEE RAY]
Bitch, I pull up in that motherfucking donk
Florida to N.O., we down to catch a homi'
Bipolar switching, twitching, now I'm Tony with the Tommy
Demonic logic, I might vomit from popping narcotics
Biologic product of a savage, my mama's psychotic
Here to abolish, killing trees with the touch of my finger
My shadows linger, the crypt keeper, it's $carecrow the reaper
Burning infernos, I'm eternal, these fuckboys just verbal
G-R-E-Y, hear the war cry of thousands that's burning

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
My T is black, hell is dark, and so is my heart
But it's switchin' like the nigga with the Yu-Gi-Oh! cards
Against all odds, eyes on another when you go against god
The ultimate is watching, so I guess I'm in charge
And if you think that you're hard, I'ma act retarded
Why you ride bikes? Better off in a car bitch
I'm off it, stop, then I'm back in my starship
The ultimate martian in the hood will only look like hobgoblin
Steady mobbing, push it to the limit I could talk about rough bitch
Know a couple niggas that can afford the apartments
Black on black lens so I'm black and I'm heartless
Shots in the dark, I'm an excellent marksman
Chop a choppa down, come around with karma
That's why a nigga vibe when a nigga want drama
Wish a nigga would like Cosmo and Wanda
No Timmy got a long black Jimmy
Smoking on that season milli and the plug is outta Philly
And I still tote the semi when I'm runnin' through the city
Like a motherfucking renegade
Reminiscing 'bout the brothers of my old days
All back bringing back to my old ways
Closed case, peel a nigga like a young K, my nigga

[Outro: Denzel Curry]
Drowning in my thoughts around inside will kill me in the sleep
Feeling all my days are numbered, count until the end of me
Angel wings broken but I'll never let the devil creep
ULT for life and I'ma rap until the death of me
Drowning in my thoughts around inside will kill me in the sleep
Feelin' like all my days are numbered, count until the end of me
Angel wings broken but I'll never let the devil creep
Ultimately $uicidal that means I can never sleep
