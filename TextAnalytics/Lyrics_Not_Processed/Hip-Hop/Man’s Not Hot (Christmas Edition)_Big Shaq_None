Two plus two is four
Minus one that's three, quick maths
Everyday man's on the block

If she ain't on it, I ghost (hah!)
Look at your nose
You donut, nose long like garden hose

I tell her man's not hot (oh yeah), I tell her man's not hot
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot, oh yeah)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)

Hop out the four-door with the .44
It was one, two, three and four (us man)
Chillin' in the corridor (yo)

And he's still callin' man for a draw (look at him)
Let him know

Take man's Twix by force (take it, oh yeah)
Send man's shop by force (send it, oh yeah)
