[Chorus: Dcmbr]
Excuse me, excuse me
I don't do this usually but I know what you need
You need a nigga like me
You ain't never had a nigga pull up on you and do what I do
And you won't ever come across another nigga in the world that's gon' do what I do, I do, ooh

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Ayy lil' baby go bananas
Lamming off a pile of Montana
G-O-D, I had it creamy while I'm cramming
I can't even lie, Ahkyana hexa hella Helen
And these other lil hoes can't stand it
She cakin' through the pajamas
Slither in the DM like, what's poppin' with lil' baby tonight?
I'm on this flight to NY, you be cattin' on me, I don't see why
I'm sippin' Act, paid three airlines, you compliment my fly
These other niggas boofy and dry
Nookie number, tell 'em scoot to the side
You need a goon on your side
Medallion got a scoop full of ice
Ugly nigga with a beautiful life
A lot of juice in the Sprite

[Chorus: Dcmbr]
Excuse me, excuse me
I don't do this usually but I know what you need
You need a nigga like me
You ain't never had a nigga pull up on you and do what I do
And you won't ever come across another nigga in the world that's gon' do what I do, I do, ooh

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Her nigga kept her in the house, she couldn't do shit
He liked to tell her 'bout his fun with his new chicks
I saw her cruisin' 'round the town in his new whip
I started breaking that bitch for them blue strips
She fucked around and fell in love with Too $hort
Who the fuck you think bought my new Porsche?
I told her 'bout the game, that's where she got it from
Fuck a Porsche, I want a Benz, the bitch bought me one
And hella other shit with that nigga's cash
Then threw his ass away 'cause that nigga's trash
I said bitch, what are you smoking?
We gon' need that nigga for some more shit, stupid bitch

[Chorus: Dcmbr]
Excuse me, excuse me
I don't do this usually but I know what you need
You need a nigga like me
You ain't never had a nigga pull up on you and do what I do
And you won't ever come across another nigga in the world that's gon' do what I do, I do, ooh

[Verse 3: Yhung T.O.]
You was fuckin' with a lame, he wasn't treating you right
All that disrespect I seen, I wasn't takin' light
I was just waiting for that moment when the time was right
When I first pulled up in that foreign it was late at night
I asked you do you got a man, you said you used to
Already knew what it was before I knew you
I asked her why you always put up with that bullshit?
She said if you was me, what would you do?
Now she fuckin' with a boss and now she keep on callin'
Long as you keep on acting right then you gon' keep on ballin'
When I pull up it's way more action and it's way less talking
I let you ride it like a Benz, but you just was walking, damn

[Chorus: Dcmbr]
Excuse me, excuse me
I don't do this usually but I know what you need
You need a nigga like me
You ain't never had a nigga pull up on you and do what I do
And you won't ever come across another nigga in the world that's gon' do what I do, I do, ooh
