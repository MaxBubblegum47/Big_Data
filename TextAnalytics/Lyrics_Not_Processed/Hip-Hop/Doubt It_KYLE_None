[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, she trippin'
She don't know she fuckin' with King Wavy
Wave, yeah

[Verse 1]
I know something only I know
I got super powers but that's something only I know
What I want is mine if I say it in my mind though
Teach you if I had time, yeah, do I got the time? No
Shit these niggas dream about is not even a milestone
Call up Dr. Seuss, I think they running out of rhymes though
Jugging and finessing, we've heard that a hundred times though
Niggas keep repeating theyself like they in a vine
In a vine, in a vine though
Why they gotta lie, though?
Say them diamonds dancing homie, we know that it's rhinestones
I don't got a 'rari but my whip is really mine though
I don't got no thotties but I know my bitch is fine though
I'm from California, you can tell just by my Vans
My nigga's about it, you can tell just by his stance
Don't throw no subliminals or he'll be throwing hands
My bro-bro play baseball, I hope you know how to catch
I just heard my cue, ooh, they know I'm up next
Curly headed cute cute
, she send me the text
Yeah, I been the dude dude since I made a YouTube
Fuck a million views, needed views
 
somewhere floating like I'm Mewtwo

[Chorus]
Zoning in California 
on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, 
she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it
Zoning in California 
on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, 
she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it

[Verse 2]
Haircut like the 80's, yeah
Don't need a Mercedes
To maneuver Uber everywhere
Bank account like ...wait
Let's not even take it there
My career don't make it fair
Ain't no elevator to success, I had to take the stairs
How you think I made it here? Climbin', climbin'
How you think you make it here? Grindin', grindin'
I chase after what I want and I don't stop to take a breath
You can't run up on me, yeah
You need to take baby baby baby baby baby steps
Who you think you playin' with?
Nigga I'm a gamer, yeah, you should check my gamer tag
Fire spittin' kid, and who you kiddin'? I will flame your ass
Call of Duty champion, do you know who you aimin' at?
Nigga, you my son, fuck around and I'll rename your ass
Give you to adoption, make your mama come reclaim your ass (Bruh)
Well, I guess that's a little harsh
But everyone can't be a star
Sometimes niggas gotta read they script and play they part
Aw man damn, why is that so hard?
I don't know, I don't know, man
I just want to play Assassin's Creed
Give my baby what she needs
And watch my HBO shows in peace
Peace

[Chorus]
Zoning in California 
on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, 
she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it
Zoning in California 
on a mountain
High up, I'm with my main thing, she keep me grounded
Don't test us, 
she with the extras, read all about it
You 'bout it? I really doubt it, I really doubt it
