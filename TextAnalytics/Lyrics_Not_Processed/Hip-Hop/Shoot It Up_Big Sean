[Intro]
Hol' Up

[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Say you love it (Love it, love it)
You think that you got the answers
Say you're 'bout it ('Bout it, 'bout it)
Boy, you know you're such a cancer
I knew that I (Knew that I)
Know that I wanna be next to you
'Cause you know that I been
Wonderin' about what you doin'
Wonderin' about where we goin'
Tell me, what am I missin' baby? Missin', oh
What am I missin' from this?
Tell me that you want this
Tell me that you run this, 'cause

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I can’t be with another nigga
Who won't return my love
Got me fucked up, I'll shoot some shit up
Pretense, I can't pretend, no

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
Tell me if you notice, notice that I'm out of focus
Baby boy, you know it's bogus
I just wanna know if you feel me
I just wanna know if you hear me
I just wanna know if you with this
Nigga, what you want? Is you wit' it? Yeah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Big Sean]
I can't be with another nigga
Who won't return my love
Got me fucked up, I'll shoot some shit up (Yeah)
Pretense (Brrt), I can't pretend, no (Look)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I talk way less than I demonstrated
I need my respect reciprocated
Taylore made just like your little baby (Yeah)
If it's not a reason, then you make it
Sometimes I feel like you love to hate me
I never give you trauma someone gave me
Talk like you fuck too crazy (Woah)
I can tell it's hittin' from your faces
When you bustin', get to shakin', I know
Relationships
If it's not first, then it's in the worst place
I can tell you don't trust me
But behind trust issues is the one who gave 'em to you in the first place
Sweet tea, do you want me when you need me?
You still there for me when you leave me, trust me and believe me
You say you feel mistreated, how? Okay, show me
I only know much as you teach me 'cause

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I can't be with another nigga
Who won’t return my love
Got me fucked up, I'll shoot some shit up
Pretense, I can't pretend, no

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh no, no
Oh yeah (I'ma shoot the shit up)
Alright, oh
Yeah, oh
