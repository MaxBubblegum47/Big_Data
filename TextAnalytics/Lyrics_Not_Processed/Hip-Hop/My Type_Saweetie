[Intro]
Hennessy on my lips, take a little sip
Privacy on the door, I'ma make the shit grip

[Chorus]
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
Bad bitch, I'ma ride the dick all night
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
That's my type, nigga, that's my type

[Post-Chorus]
New wrist, new whip, ride around dipped
I can see why all these basic hoes pissed

[Verse 1]
Bust down wrist, not a bust down bitch (Ah)
Said I want your man, no the fuck I don't, sis (Uh, uh)
If he a rich nigga, why he still hitting licks? (Licks)
Nigga spending bread but he still can't hit
Bitch please (Bitch), Lamborghini keys
Pussy dripping ice, he get flown out to me
Bitch please, I want a man with the Bs (Yeah)
Pussy from the Bay, goin' dumb on the D (Hahaha)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hennessy on my lips, take a little sip
Privacy on the door, I'ma make the shit grip

[Chorus]
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
Bad bitch, I'ma ride the dick all night
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
That's my type, nigga, that's my type

[Post-Chorus]
New wrist, new whip, ride around dipped
I can see why all these basic hoes pissed

[Verse 2]
Messy hoes like to pop shit (Messy hoes)
You the type that's fuckin' for the rent (You a thot)
All on another nigga dick (On the dick)
Hair ain't nothin' with a inch (Hahaha)
Do it on his face with a thizz (Ugh)

Run it up (Uh), print it up, big bucks (Ayy, ayy)
Try your luck (Uh), none of my bitches been touched

[Pre-Chorus]
Hennessy on my lips, take a little sip
Privacy on the door, I'ma make the shit grip

[Chorus]
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
Bad bitch, I'ma ride the dick all night
