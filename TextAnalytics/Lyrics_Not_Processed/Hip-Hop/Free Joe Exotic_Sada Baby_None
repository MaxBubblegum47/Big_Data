Enrgy made this one

[Verse 1: BFB Da Packman]
Trapped the whole winter, scammed for the summer
Came to America with dope in her stomach
Spent eleven hundred on these Valentino runners
We just fuckin' for the summer, 'fore I hit, I change my number
Packman on the track? It's a slapper
I'll jump off a bridge 'fore I put my dick in plastic
I was so fucked up that I had to sell plasma
If my bitch say, "Bless you," when you sneeze, you can have her
Don't blame me if you broke, you just a woulda, coulda, shoulda
Try to rob me, you hear the booka, booka, booka
I don't like good girls, I like hooker, hooker, hookers
And I don't sell crack, I'm givin' niggas booger sugar
Call the plug, and he pullin' up on a Kawasaki
Tell my brother if he catch a body, then I'm tellin' mommy
Hallelujah, Jesus Christ, but I'm with a thousand ahkis
Came up from sellin' pussy, free my nigga Joe Exotic
She said she can feel it in her stomach, stop capping
Ol' lyin' ass bitch, my dick ain't that big
Cougar bitch, but she look good, Toni Braxton
I-I-I-I-I got low self-esteem, I was a fat kid
Suck it good, chew it, then swallow, Sour Patch Kid
My bitch 'bout to leave me 'cause I'm built like Patrick
I nut super quick and I be weighin' down the mattress
On the low, dawg, I'm tired of this fat shit
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I ain't signed to nobody, bitch, I work for me
Bitch fucked an opp for revenge, she think she hurtin' me
Caught 'em both slippin' at the movies, gave 'em First Degree
Rihanna got warts, in that case, bitch, herpe me

[Verse 2: Sada Baby]
I tell a bitch if she ain't suckin' dick, then leave me be (Hah)
I need a freaky ho to eat the dingaling, yeah (On God)
And don't get red, your baby mama off of ching-a-ling
I think she think me and her got a thing (Naw)
Bitch, naw, you ain't gettin' a damn thing but my balls (Okay)
Don't reply to your texts, I'm ignorin' your calls, look (Bitch)
Gotta hit the trap, I got plays for that raw (I do)
Whole thangs, we got bricks, we got blocks of that dog (We does)
Break it down, watch me boogie on that pussy while I'm smokin' booky (Ooh)
Huh, baby daddy talkin' tough, I give that boy a noogie (Lame)
Still make his baby mama stuff a script up in her tushie (I will)
Used to skip school with them sticks, playin' hockey hooky (Get it?)
Catch a snitch lackin' on his balcony, Tekashi (Lame)
My Asian nigga keep a hot chop clip, wasabi
Packman got some fat fans in the lobby (He do)
Skuba Steve got some lame niggas tryna clout chase
Packman ate your grandmama with the pound cake
Skuba Steve movin' every gram down to the shake
Hmm, fuck a pandemic, Flint water been fucked up, huh
Ain't nobody send nobody there to help us, huh
Bounce back, shake back, picked our self up, huh (Tell 'em)
Still trap around this bitch, the Lord blessed us, huh (Talk)
I got 'bows in the mail when I wake up, huh (Okay)
I might give that bitch a Perc' if she take one (Nigga, do it)
You can't hit that dope with no two, don't even take one (Do it, do it)
Huh, you ain't never had no topside, we got A1, huh (Okay)
I done ran up a hundred through this quarantine, huh (You trippin')
Ain't shit boring 'bout them bands, give me more heem (Okay)
You'll never hear no bitch say she bored with me (Not ever)
You'll never hear no nigga say he hard as me, huh (Not never)
If the nigga play, then he gon' be a corpse, uh (On God)
Baby Drac', got the chop and a 40

[Verse 3: BFB Da Packman]
I'm super healthy, mixin' syrup with the Jamba Juice
You ever got head from a fiend that was snaggletooth?
Home Depot, when we slide down, we bring them hammers through
Chopper with the knife, it'll slice a nigga cabbage loose
Before I trick with a bitch, I'll wear a condom
I hate to eat fruit, my diet bad, so she hate to swallow
I'm really fucked up, they put gin in my baby bottle
Tell my brother if he catch another body, I'ma tell my mama
Fire top, lockjaw, had to grab the bed
She like Perc' dick when we fuckin', let me grab my meds
Popped a nigga, but he didn't die, he went and grabbed the feds
When I eat your pussy from the back, baby, grab my head
Ugh, I'm complacent now
K bullets flyin' through the crib and flipped the place around
Was in a one bedroom, it's lookin' spacious now
Vacuum seal some rabbit food, voila, I can make a pound
Whip a pint with some wood, I'm a lumberjack
Nigga mad his bitch fucked me, didn't even hump her back
Instead of slidin', beefin' bout a bitch, you need to dump her ass
This bop stick'll fuck a pornstar, it got the nuts attached
Okay, listen, I'm 'bout to quit rappin'
I like my bitches dumb and illiterate, 'cause they get nasty
Donut eatin' got me diabetes, nigga, fuck salad
My bitch cheatin', fed her to the animals, Carole Baskin

[Verse 4: Sada Baby]
Whip a four, ayy, huh (Mmm)
Serve a four-piece, huh (Mmm)
FN, front seat where ya ho be (Mmm)
I put tints on my nephew Huffy bike, keep him low-key (Bitch)
I ain't extra, bitch, you special if you get close to  me, huh (Uh, yeah)
Everybody 'round me rich, how it's 'posed to be (Uh, yeah)
Big booty buttnaked bitch while I roll my weed (Uh, yeah)
Lil' thot, I'm a million-dollar nigga, hop on your knees
You ain't never seen forty thousand in all blue cheese
Told DT put it on the opps, that's all you need
We gon' bick back, drop a pop, and watch all you bleed, huh
Watch all y'all die, huh, watch all you dead, huh
Bitch it's get back gang, need all that bread, huh (Yeah)
Got scopes with the yops, we aimin' at heads, huh (Bang)
We scrapin' niggas whole blocks, they aimin' at legs (Goofy)
Like we gotta get equal, you heard what I said (You hear me?)
Like we gotta get even, you know how we play it (Do you hear me?)
Like this rifle illegal, I'm still gon' spray it, huh (On God)
I might shoot it diagonal and knock off his mans, huh
Me and Stewie high fivin', we done dropped a nigga, huh
Me and relative got a smile, know what time it is, huh
Meet TayTay on a mile for a pound of meds (Yeah)
'Bout to jugg a nigga outta town, I ain't stoppin' shit (On God)
Nutball, probably gave your titi a crack rock (For real)
Lil' bro'll beat your ass if you try some shit, duh
