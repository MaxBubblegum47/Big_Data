[Intro]
Ayy

[Chorus]
See me run, see me run
Runnin' 'til my lungs might give
Runnin' for the front, I feel like Usain in this bitch (Ayy)
Passin' all these runners, number one is in my list
Blinders on me, I can't even see
See me in my tour bus by myself
Call me selfish 'cause I got me and nobody else
Give myself an envelope just like it's per diem (Ayy)
Twenty mirrors in my crib, I'm hangin' with my friends

[Bridge]
Feelin' like I traveled through some time, oh man
Skippin' through some years but it feel right, oh yeah
Gettin' ready for some blessings comin' our way
Forrest, Forrest runnin' for some days

[Verse]
I'll do the shit 'til the credits roll
Already got through the greatest goals
Met with a girl when I went back home (Ayy)
She put me in a group chat with that pussy
Talk to it, send emojis to the pussy
Then beat it up 'til it wanna go sue me (Ayy)
My brother called me and told me to man up
Told me to be lactose tolerant
Man stop avoidin' that cheddar (Ayy)
In love with the Solo cups
I'm on the road and I'm lovin' my bunk
Still missin' home, but I'm havin' my fun, uh
I would never quit, I'm too legit
Indonesian MC Hammer in this bitch
Beat your ass if you correct my grammar in this bitch
I done way too much for you to say my parents' rich (Nah)
But I'm tryna make it happen
Makin' green like Geico
All because I'm nice, ho
They know what I like though
Pussy on my rider
Groupies is some psychos
My bedroom is a psych ward
Tell that girl to smile more
I take it on my Leica

[Bridge]
Feelin' like I traveled through some time, oh man
Skippin' through some years but it feel right, oh yeah
Gettin' ready for some blessings comin' our way
Forrest, Forrest runnin' for some days

[Chorus]
See me run, see me run
Runnin' 'til my lungs might give
Runnin' for the front, I feel like Usain in this bitch (Ayy)
Passin' all these runners, number one is in my list
Blinders on me, I can't even see
See me in my tour bus by myself
Call me selfish 'cause I got me and nobody else
Give myself an envelope just like it's per diem (Ayy)
Twenty mirrors in my crib, I'm hangin' with my friends
