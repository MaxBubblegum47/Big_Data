[Intro: Lil Mosey]
Oh-oh
Ayy, Royce, you did it right here

[Chorus: Lil Mosey]
Still poppin' Xans, 2019
Pour up the lean, got me stuck in a dream (Lean)
Started hittin' licks back in 2014 ('14)
I got the ice on me, drippin' CELINE (CELINE)
Flawless came in off a hun' (Hun')
Me and my niggas still drippin' for fun (Yeah, we drippin')
Been knew I was the one (One)
Still got niggas on the run, yeah (On the run, yeah)

[Verse 1: Lil Mosey]
I got these diamonds, my chain swang
I got these bands, ain't shit changed
Talkin' like you want that smoke (Smoke)
We want the same thing (Brra)
I got a brand new check (Check)
Then I put ten on my neck, mmm
Then I got a new Patek, yeah
Fly in that bitch with a TEC
Six on a new fit, fifty for a drop-top (Drop)
I was off a bean, the Tech made me Wock' talk (Talk)
Never been a lame, ain't shit to make her top drop
Smokin' on gas, 'Wood how I lift off
Last year was broke, this year flooded a Patek
I keep fourteen racks in my Seattle attic
I hit her two times, then you niggas can have it (Oh-oh)
My young niggas pull up and shoot like the Magic (Prrt)

[Chorus: Lil Mosey]
Still poppin' Xans, 2019
Pour up the lean, got me stuck in a dream (Lean)
Started hittin' licks back in 2014 ('14)
I got the ice on me, drippin' CELINE (CELINE)
Flawless came in off a hun' (Hun')
Me and my niggas still drippin' for fun (Yeah, we drippin')
Been knew I was the one (One)
Still got niggas on the run, yeah (On the run, yeah)

[Verse 2: Gunna & 
Lil Mosey
]
I made it out of the hood (Hood)
I still got some dawgs on the run, yeah
This shit comin' in by the ton (Ton)
I started this rap shit for fun, yeah
Last weekend I was in Milan (Milan)
You niggas ain't did what I done, yeah
We fuck in the rise of the sun (Sun)
My girl got a bag full of buns, yeah
Hit it, I speed up the Porsche (Skrrt)
911, it's a sport (Sport)
They pay to listen to my voice (Voice)
Rich or poor, gotta make you a choice (Choice)
I can play with your ho, make her moist (Yeah)
Told her "Call me," she don't need a toy (Call)
I'm a saucy young nigga, no soy (Soy, 
oh-oh
)
And they know not to play with the boy, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Mosey]
Still poppin' Xans, 2019
Pour up the lean, got me stuck in a dream (Lean)
Started hittin' licks back in 2014 ('14)
I got the ice on me, drippin' CELINE (CELINE)
Flawless came in off a hun' (Hun')
Me and my niggas still drippin' for fun (Yeah, we drippin')
Been knew I was the one (One)
Still got niggas on the run, yeah (On the run, yeah)
