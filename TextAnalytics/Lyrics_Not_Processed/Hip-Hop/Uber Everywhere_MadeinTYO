Nawfside cooling, shorty, yeah that's where I stay

And my ex keep calling, swear that she be in the way
And I need a thick redbone shorty where I lay
Bad bih in L.A., tell me that she'll make the trip
Shorty bad as hell, yeah, with them Kylie Jenner lips
Uber every-fucking-where, pre-rolls in my VIP
Canada jawn, yeah I think that bitch from the 6

[Chorus 1]
Shorty wanna kiss me, but I know she sucking dick

[Chorus 2]
Shorty wanna fuck me but I know I got some top
Shorty wanna fuck me but I just got some top (Skrrt-skrrt)
