[Chorus]
Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang (Bhabie gang)
Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang (Bhabie gang)
Spent ten racks on a new chain
Dropped another stack on some new J's
Everyday my birthday, I got cake
Money on my line, hear my phone ring
And I go skrrt in my own lane
Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang (Bhabie gang)
Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang (Bhabie gang)
Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang (Bhabie gang)
Spent ten racks on a new chain
Dropped another stack on some new J's
Everyday my birthday, I got cake
Money on my line, hear my phone ring
And I go skrrt in my own lane
Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang, Bhabie gang (Bhabie gang)
