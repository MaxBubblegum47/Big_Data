[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Drop top Porsche (Porsche), Rollie on my wrist (Wrist)
Diamonds up and down my chain (Aha)
Cardi B, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin'
Bossed up and I changed the game (You see me?)
It's my big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook (Shook)
My big fat ass got all them boys hooked (Hooked)
I went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands (Ha)
Bruno sang to me while I do my money dance like ayy
Flexin' on the 'Gram like ayy
Hit the Lil' Jon, okay (Okay), okay (Okay)
Oh yeah, we drippin' in finesse and getting paid, ow

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long (All night long)
Yeah, I know we'll turn heads forever (Forever)
So tonight, I'm gonna show you off

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby, don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Verse 3: Bruno Mars]
Now slow it down for me, baby (Slow it down now)
'Cause I love the way it feels when we grind (We grind)
Yeah, our connection's so magnetic on the floor
Nothing can stop us tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby, don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

[Bridge: Bruno Mars & Cardi B]
Fellas, grab your ladies if your lady fine
Tell her she the one, she the one for life (Woo)
Ladies, grab your fellas and let's do this right (Do this right)
If you're on one like me in mind (Ow!)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us? (Ayy)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (Yeah)
Girl, we got it goin' on
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (Hey)
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy? (Feels so good on you)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
We out here drippin' in finesse (We drippin' on them)
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse with my baby
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it (yeah, you know we got it goin' on)

[Outro: Cardi B & Bruno Mars, Both]
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
You know it, you know it
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Girl, we got it
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
You know it, you know it
