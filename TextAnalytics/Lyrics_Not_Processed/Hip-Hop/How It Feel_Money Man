(CamGotHits)

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm rockin' chains like a field nigga
How the fuck you real and you squeal, nigga?
Roll that pressure up and pop a seal, nigga
Come here, baby girl, I'm tryna build with you
Heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
Heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
She coolin' with a real one, how it feel, baby?
She coolin' with a real one, how it feel, baby?
Heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
I heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
Bitch, I'm rockin' chains like a field nigga
How the fuck you real and you squeal, nigga?

[Verse 1]
Heard you getting money how you feelin', nigga?
I been stackin' money to the ceiling, nigga
Had to cut him off, I heard he squealin'
If they give me life, a nigga gon' appeal it
Money make the world turn, money make the world turn
Got my haters salty, got them niggas catchin' heartburn
I was in the streets just tryna show this shit is hard-earned
VVS's in my chain, I'm givin' niggas sunburn
Ridin' with the shooters and you know they 'bout to murder somethin'
He ain't 'bout that life, that lil' nigga ain't finna hurt nothin'
I was in the bando weighing up, I had to make somethin'
I'd rather catch a bullet 'fore I let a nigga take somethin'
I was selling bales on the low, I had to shake somethin'
Shawty got an ass, bend it over, baby, shake somethin'
If she ain't a dime, I'ma fuck around and make her one
Fuck them lil' losses, pussy nigga, I ain't takin' one
They say them straps illegal in New York, I'm still bringin' one
Thirty killers with me, nigga, I ain't just bringin' one
I be in the gutter with the hooligans
Shoot at you, reload, and then I shoot again
Diamonds reel these bitches in

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm rockin' chains like a field nigga
How the fuck you real and you squeal, nigga?
Roll that pressure up and pop a seal, nigga
Come here, baby girl, I'm tryna build with you
Heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
Heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
She coolin' with a real one, how it feel, baby?
She coolin' with a real one, how it feel, baby?
Heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
I heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
Bitch, I'm rockin' chains like a field nigga
How the fuck you real and you squeal, nigga?

[Verse 2]
I'ma show these niggas where I came from
I shot four niggas with the same gun
Feds came to me, I ain't say nothin'
I'ma fuck around and have to spray somethin'
You dealing with a real one, how it feel, baby?
Shout out to the streets, what's the deal, baby?
I was on the Moon Rock last night and I'm still faded
I been gettin' money, now my subdivision gated
My circle small, so you niggas cannot penetrate it
I know a Tonya, she just want a lil' penetration
Beef with me, we grab them choppers and we invadin'
Knock you off, pop some bottles, and we celebrate it
She just wanna take my dick and marinate it
I grab some gold and let them diamonds come and marinate
I was in the jungle, I was stuck inside a bowl
We don't fight or tussle, we just grab them straps and bust 'em
I heard you snitching, yeah, I heard you snitching on your friends
Last nigga tried me, he was never seen again
I left that ho alone, we can never be again
Run off with a pack and you will never eat again

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm rockin' chains like a field nigga
How the fuck you real and you squeal, nigga?
Roll that pressure up and pop a seal, nigga
Come here, baby girl, I'm tryna build with you
Heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
Heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
She coolin' with a real one, how it feel, baby?
She coolin' with a real one, how it feel, baby?
Heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
I heard you getting money, how it feel, nigga?
Bitch, I'm rockin' chains like a field nigga
How the fuck you real and you squeal, nigga?
