[Verse 1]
Right from the start, I knew we could never part
Something magic in the way that you move
Oh, what a shame we could never feel the pain
That our past tried to put in our view

[Pre Chorus]
This feeling, it surrounds me, oh
Turning me around 'til I lose control
This feeling, it surrounds me, oh
I can see the sun is shining on your soul

[Chorus]
So let's keep it gold, mmm
Darling, we don't ever have to grow old
Just keep it gold, mmm
Darling, we got stories left to be told

[Verse 2]
Okay, we got a new dawn, new day
Go and grab your suitcase
Same walk, new pace
Go on, tie your shoe lace
Ain't got a lot of money, but got a lot of time
So let's spend it where it's sunny
Let us see what we can find

[Pre Chorus]
This feeling, it surrounds me, oh
Turning me around 'til I lose control
This feeling, it surrounds me, oh
I can see the sun is shining on your soul

[Chorus]
So let's keep it gold, mmm
Darling, we don't ever have to grow old
Just keep it gold, mmm
Darling, we got stories left to be told
Let's keep it gold, mmm
Darling, we don't ever have to grow old
Just keep it gold, mmm
Darling, we got stories left to be told

[Bridge]
We don't need no money
To spread a little honey
We got all we need here
Just leave me where it's sunny
We don't need no money
To spread a little honey
We got all we need here, just

[Chorus]
Just keep it gold, mmm
Darling, we don't ever have to grow old
Just keep it gold, mmm
Darling, we got stories left to be told
Let's keep it gold, mmm
Darling, we don't ever have to grow old
Just keep it gold, mmm
Darling, we got stories left to be told
