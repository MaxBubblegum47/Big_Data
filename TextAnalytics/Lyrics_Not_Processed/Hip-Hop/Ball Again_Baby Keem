[Chorus]
Born to ball again
Yeah I been born to ball again
I might just make a band bitch I been born to ball again
I might Randy Moss a friend, bitch I been born to ball again
Im born to ball again bitch I’ve been born to ball again (like oh my god)
Born to ball again

[Verse 1]
[?]
From the city where the niggas want to see you fall back in
[?]
Had to let my girl back in
Please release my soul of sin
Bitch I relay race against the fucking time, hope the lord forgive me
[?], hope the lord forgive me
I might flex the bezel, let it shine, hope that y’all all feel mе

[Chorus]
Born to ball again
Yeah I been born to ball again
I might just make a band bitch I been born to ball again
I might Randy Moss a friend bitch I been born to ball again
Im born to ball again bitch I’vе been born to ball again
Born to ball again
Yeah I been born to ball again
I might just make a band bitch I been born to ball again
I might Randy Moss a friend bitch I been born to ball again
Im born to ball again bitch I’ve been born to ball again (aye, aye)

[Verse 2]
I got racks on me
I got stats on me like where you been
Ballin fatally until my time to see
See the god
Why your girl on me
She drooling over me like oh my god
Don’t you see this denim
Don't you see this denim, with the squad
Don't you see this snake skin
Bitch its full of venom, like oh my god
Living like a menace you live out your welcome, what the fuck?
Any many bitiies we just call em fitties, what the fuck?
Ray band ray band with me
Ray band ray band with me, what the fuck?

[Chorus]
Born to ball again
Yeah I been born to ball again
I might just make a band bitch I been born to ball again
I might Randy Moss a friend bitch I been born to ball again
Im born to ball again bitch I’ve been born to ball again
Born to ball again
Yeah I been born to ball again
I might just make a band bitch I been born to ball again
I might Randy Moss a friend bitch I been born to ball again
Im born to ball again bitch I’ve been born to ball again

[Outro]
Like oh my god
Like oh my god
