[Verse 1]
Wait a minute
I think I left my conscience on your front doorstep, oh oh
Wait a minute
I think I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
But I'm here right now, right now
(Right now, right now)
Just sitting in a cloud, oh wow
I'm here right now, right now with you, oh wow, oh wow
(Right now, with you)
I don't even care
Iâ€™ll run my hands through your hair
You wanna run your fingers through mine
But my dreads too thick and that's alright

[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute
Feel my heart's intention, oh
Hold on, wait a minute
I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Some tings don't work
Some tings are bound to be
Some tings, they hurt
And they tear apart me
You left your diary at my house
And I read those pages, do you really love me, baby
Some tings don't work
Some tings are bound to be
Some tings, they hurt
And they tear apart me
But I broke my word, and you were bound to see
And I cried at the curb
When you first said "Oel ngati kameie"

[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute (Oh)
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute
I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Some people like to live
Some just tryin' to get by
Some people I like that hurt
Some just rather say goodbye, bye

[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute
I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, ah, ah
Let's go get it, ah, ah
(Ahh, ooh)
(Ahh, ooh)
(Ahh, ooh)
