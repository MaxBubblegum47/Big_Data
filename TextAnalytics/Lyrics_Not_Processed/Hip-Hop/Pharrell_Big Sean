[Skit: Pharrell Williams]
Hello, yo, um
So when I met the nigga Big Sean
Um, Kanye brought him through
He was like "Yo, you got to check out this guy man"
Young nigga, he goe alright
And uh, I'm like alright
And the kid just, you know
His confidence is like
I already know I was thinking to myself
Ok, you look a little bit timid
And now you know
This nigga just started rhyming
And he just was busting
And you know, the metaphors were smart
The wordplay was slick
You know? Just clever
You know and he's obviously a sneakerhead
Major gear, you know
He's wiping his ass on you niggas
I don't think he mean to
You know, he's not like that
He's not like a boastful guy
He's just, he doesn't mean to
He's really just
Wiping his ass on you niggas
You know what it is
P out
Yessir
