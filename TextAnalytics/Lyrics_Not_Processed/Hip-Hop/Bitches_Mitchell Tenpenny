[Verse 1]
My daddy always told me to be aware of my surroundings
Yeah, I got eyes all over this town
Yeah, you got caught kissing another guitar-picking bro
Says you're the one he's singing about

[Chorus]
Well, I don't deal with bitches no more
Yeah, I don't deal with bitches no more
I could call you crazy, curse your name
Throw your shit out the door
But I don't deal with bitches no more

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hey, I still believe in love
But not the kind you're making with every guy in this pub
No one to blame but myself
I should've known you were with someone else
When I watched you give that "just a friend" a hug

[Chorus]
Well, I don't deal with bitches no more
Yeah, I don't deal with bitches no more
I could call you crazy, curse your name
Throw your shit out the door
But I don't deal with bitches no more, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
No, I don't deal with bitches no more
No, no, no bitches (I ain't got no time)
No, no, no bitches
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more, yeah

[Bridge]
I hope that it was worth it
Your reputation, you earned it
You're the best damn deal in town, oh, so cheap
Now I love this peace and quiet
No lying, cheating, fighting
Just me, myself, and these guitar strings

[Chorus]
Well, I don't deal with bitches no more (I don't deal with bitches)
Yeah, I don't deal with bitches no more
(I don't deal with bitches no more)
I could call you crazy, curse your name (I could call you crazy)
Throw your shit out the door (Throw your shit out the door)
But I don't deal with bitches no more (No, no bitches no more)
No, I won't deal with bitches no more (I don't deal with bitches)
No, I don't deal with bitches anymore
I just don't

[Post-Chorus]
No, no, no bitches (Got no time)
No, no, no bitches
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more
I don't deal with bitches no more
(I don't deal with bitches no more)
No, no, no bitches (I could call you crazy)
No, no, no bitches
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more (Don't you say nothin' more)
No, no, no bitches (No more)
No, no, no bitches (No more)
Oh, no, no, no bitches no more (No, I don't deal with bitches)
No, no, no bitches
No, no, no bitches
