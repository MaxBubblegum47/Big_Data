[Intro]
Oh my god Ronny

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
We all they talk about, we all they talk about
Young and do what I want
That and the chain, that's what they hate about
We all they talk about, we all they talk about
Young and do what I want
That and the fame, that's what they hate about
They talk about me, they talk about you
But not like that
You posting your moves and gettin' some views
But not like that
I got money in the bank and you do too
But not like that
It's not like that
It's not like that

[Verse: Soulja Boy Tell 'Em]
(Yeah) It's not like that, ooh, walking a mile nigga
I got rap on gang, no spray [?]
I got a hundred-fifty thousand in my backpack, ooh
Stand in the [?] and I beat up the pan
No Draco, [?] perk head and I [?] xans
Niggas wanna [?] my [?]
I gotta quarter mill in Japan

[?] drive around 2020 Mercedes
Round the right time, me and Bhad Bhabie
Made the wrong moves, nigga's you crazy?
New Draco, came with the lazer
Smoking on dope, countin' up paper
I should be the president not the major
Big bank wood, came different flavours
Made the wrong move, get hit with the [?]

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
We all they talk about, we all they talk about
Young and do what I want
That and the chain, that's what they hate about
We all they talk about, we all they talk about
Young and do what I want
That and the fame, that's what they hate about
They talk about me, they talk about you
But not like that
You posting your moves and gettin' some views
But not like that
I got money in the bank and you do too
But not like that
It's not like that
It's not like that
