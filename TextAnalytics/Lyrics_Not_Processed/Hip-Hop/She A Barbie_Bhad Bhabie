[Chorus: Yung Mal]
My bitch bad, yeah she a barbie
[?] drip, [?]
Six rings on, [?]
Bitch so nasty, when we fuck she record it
Might as well pick up your casket, don't know no warning
Ball like a basket
[?], I play for the Hornets
Pussy ass niggas so corny, back and came this morning

[Verse 1: Bhad Bhabie]
If he [?], checking for me
Tryna see me then he paying a fee
Go to the drop, we know where you be
When my brothers, they bustin', they [?] the team (team)
Pull up at the game, that's on me like Jason (Jason)
Chase coming in too fast, can't pace it
New J's, too fast can't race it
Don't fuck with these ho's, they broke and they basic (they basic)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2: Bhad Bhabie]
Bad 'lil bitch at the racks
Swiping this [?] then I'm calling them [?]
[?] and I'm making the texts
She talk to me crazy, I'm snatching the track
Real ass bitch, I'ma keep it a stack
The ho wanna block me, she know that she whack
[?] drip on my shoes, it's all on my clothes

[Chorus: Yung Mal]
My bitch bad, yeah she a barbie
[?] drip, [?]
Six rings on, [?]
Bitch so nasty, when we fuck she record it
Might as well pick up your casket, don't know no warning
Ball like a basket
[?], I play for the Hornets
Pussy ass niggas so corny, back and came this morning
