[Chorus: Flesh-N-Bone]
Top-top-top notch, top gun
Incredible, impeccable, yeah
Go fuckin' insane
Always been ready for war
Top notch, top gun
Incredible, impeccable, yeah
Go fuckin' insane
Always been ready for war
T-t-top notch, top gun
Incredible, impeccable, yeah
Go fuckin' insane
Always been ready for war

[Verse 1: Flesh-N-Bone]
Top notch, top gun
Incredible, impeccable
Come on over, we having a blast
Just like we told you, several
Let them know 'cause that's my duty
Fuck you if you think I'm unruly
Truly, ask me if I hardly care
You know what you can do to me
But it won't be easy, nigga
Because you never know what's up my sleeve
Maybe two 24-handles that'll blow you out like a candle
Better believe that
Teasin' you haters, ain't even full throttle
Swallowed me like a snake and go slither, nigga, and hit
Twist off like a cap from a bottle
Anybody wanna see me I don't think you can
Got lasers to clear you up like LASIK surgery
Give you twenty-twenty, mang
I prance like Ali dancin' inside the boxin' ring
Diamonds and rubies cover me on top like a crown on a king
Bust a U then swing around, pull up on them niggas from the right
Smilin' down, yo faint ass smile turned into a frown
What made that nigga renounce the stupid shit he said
When he said it, he knew that he was dead, yup

[Chorus: Flesh-N-Bone]
Top-top-top notch, top gun
Incredible, impeccable, yeah
Go fuckin' insane
Always been ready for war
Top notch, top gun
Incredible, impeccable, yeah
Go fuckin' insane
Always been ready for war
T-t-top notch, top gun
Incredible, impeccable, yeah
Go fuckin' insane
Always been ready for war
Top notch, top gun
Incredible, impeccable, yeah
Go fuckin' insane
Always been ready for war

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
Well it's sane but it don't shine often, nigga
Let me get it up off them niggas
Before I lose you, where the conclusion is, I lost you niggas
Muddy water and slouch niggas
Bunny money been [?], steady rippin' up
Flawless, with the watch on it and the red cross with the wet dip, with the fine weed
Where we whip whip, when I find lead
Maybe I get my mirror and I look at Medusa, your reflection
Finally, send me body to body and finding any bodies that choose to slime me
Sticky, dirty and grimy
On the first and the fifteen, perfect timing
Then I whip my Siamese, nigga, pass the bread
Share my mind, separate the beds, hold my head, move your legs, the world is mine
Jealous of the profit, when they figure it out they want me to stop
Red light district, fuck that shit
[?] to the [?] and the cops
I know where my kids at
Nigga where they been at
Nobody write me on lock
I'm on barley
We weedin' hot?
We keeping them hot like chemo
(Till the Lord come shining) (We know! Ingle[?])
Y'all know my (y'all know my, y'all know my)

[Chorus: Flesh-N-Bone]
Top-top-top notch, top gun
Incredible, impeccable

[Steve Harvey]
What? don' start no shit, now
Niggas be startin' a fight and shit in the club
Pull out a pistol and shit, clear everything out

[Outro]
Re-Re get them babaies back inside
They don' smoked that sherm and out here actin' a god damn fool
Nigga, I'm not scared of naan nigga
Charles, Charles, listen to me baby
Got me fucked up, nigga
You got babies in there
I light this mother fucka up like the 4th of July
You got babies in there, Charles
Nigga, what's happnin?
