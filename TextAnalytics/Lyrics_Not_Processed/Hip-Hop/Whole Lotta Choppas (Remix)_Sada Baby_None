[Intro: Nicki Minaj & Sada Baby]
Uh (The Coal Cash Collection)
It's the Queen Sleaze
Nine months motherfuckin' pregnant, like, what?
I'm bool
Sada, what up? (Bang, bang, bang)
Detroit

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ooh, lil' nigga wanna try it
I told him, "Black lives matter," I'ma riot
Ooh, ass fat, I had to buy it
Ain't a nigga alive that's gon' deny it
This nigga makin' me feel erotic (Erotic)
Uh, he a freak like Giannis (Giannis)
To be honest, I hope one day we do a play-date with Adonis
Ooh, I'm 'bout my cake, get your bakin' on
You don't want that real smoke, get your vapin' on
Egg whites, turkey bacon on
Ain't in a restaurant, but I'm the bitch they been waitin' on (Tag) Gotta pop tags, bitches stuntin' in them hand-me-down bags
It's sad, Burberry plaid, you in that drip that I already had

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They wanna see you do your dance
Do that thing pokе out them pants?
If it don't, then I got plans
Bam, just got a summertimе tan

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Scram, we're just puttin' dollars on your head
Niggas violatin' the gang gon' end up dead
Lady in the street, but a freak ho in the bed
Chopper on him, that's my shooter in the red
Lil' nigga can't keep my pussy out his hands
Fuck a last minute, gotta book me in advance
Been a bad girl and I'm tryna get spanked
Pretty little body, but my face look stank
I be in a truck that cost your whole house
Bitches imitate me but don't come close
If you wanna celebrate the best, then come toast
Bitches ain't sayin' nothin', but doin' the utmost
Heard he wanna chew on my edible panties
Even when I tell him, "See you tomorrow," he can't leave
Got the Off-White sneakers, rockin' a tan weave
When I come out, grab Simba, it's a stampede

[Verse 3: Sada Baby]
Ooh, lil' bitch wan' ride it
Told the bitch don't get out her body
Hmm, get right beside me
I'ma get in that thang, get to slidin'
This bitch makin' me feel erotic
Huh, she gotta get on this rocket
I don't give a fuck 'bout her milage
And her grandmom related to the Winans
Ooh, that's the shit that I like
You a church girl, bitch, you like Christ
Hmm, you ain't never had pipe
Least not this kind, I'ma fuck you all night
Off a Perc', hmm, off a Perc' pack
Yeah, leave a bitch with the hurt back
Go to work, hmm, where the work at?
My young niggas wakin' up to serve that

[Chorus: Sada Baby]
They wanna see me do my dance
In these thousand-dollar pants
Don't disrespect me and my mans
Bang, whole lotta choppers on your ass

[Verse 4: Sada Baby]
Scram, we just put them dollars on your head
Snitchin'-ass nigga gave his mama to the feds
Little brother, big brother, Sada got the dreads
DZ, DT, Sada keep the bands
Lil' bitch can't keep her pussy out my hands
Got a real Hood Rat Suki on my hands
I was stackin' blues, run up Tookies on they ass
I be in the Bay rollin' Cookies on they ass
I be in the 'Nellas, G Weed gave me his blessing
'Cause Sada can't be jealous off weed, I'm never stressin'
I can see the booty from the bottom, that thang a double decker
Let my white boy shoot on that thing, he Sam Dekker
Heard you used to chew on that thing, Hannibal Lecter
Have you poppin' all of them pills like Heath Ledger
These drugs ain't a joke, my nigga, I'm just tellin' you
Your manager got you on the shelf and he sellin' you

[Chorus: Sada Baby]
They wanna see me do my dance
In these thousand-dollar pants
Don't disrespect me and my mans
Bang, whole lotta choppers on your ass, ooh
