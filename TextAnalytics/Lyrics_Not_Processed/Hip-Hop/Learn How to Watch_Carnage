[Intro: MadeinTYO]
Skrrt, skrrt
Carnage! Ooh

[Chorus: MadeinTYO]
Ooh, jump out the top (skrrt skrrt, ooh)
Wrist on my watch (ooh, ooh)
Told her to stop (hey, yeah)
Learn how to watch (skrrt skrrt, yeah)
Learn how to watch (sauce, yeah)
Learn how to watch (ooh, uh)
Learn how to watch (wam, yeah)
Learn how to watch (wam, uh)
Stack up my guap (ooh, uh)
Weight in the pot (hey, uh)
Rubbin' her spot (skrrt skrrt, uh)
Learn how to watch (sauce, yeah)
Learn how to watch (ooh, yeah)
Learn how to watch (ooh, yeah)
Learn how to watch (hey, ooh)
Learn how to watch (skrrt skrrt, ooh)

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Yeah, what it look like?
Little too much sauce, get it cooked right
I'm the same mothafucka, been the same mothafucka
Make a mothafucka faint like Suge Knight
Shit, better make time
And it really ain't shit if it ain't mine
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I'm a K-9
See the way I make her go down like a bassline (whoo!)
Yeah, back when I was just a youngin'
Didn't have me nothin', always up to somethin'
Started gettin' money, now I'm off and runnin'
Way too high to function, call it comin' up
And yeah, I'm on the escalator, they be starin' at me
They the spectators and I'm player Magic
I'm a ex-Laker, I'm a mess-maker
I don't stress paper, I don't care who has it

[Chorus: MadeinTYO]
Ooh, jump out the top (skrrt skrrt, ooh)
Wrist on my watch (ooh, ooh)
Told her to stop (hey, yeah)
Learn how to watch (skrrt skrrt, yeah)
Learn how to watch (sauce, yeah)
Learn how to watch (ooh, uh)
Learn how to watch (wam, yeah)
Learn how to watch (wam, uh)
Stack up my guap (ooh, uh)
Weight in the pot (hey, uh)
Rubbin' her spot (skrrt skrrt, uh)
Learn how to watch (swag, yeah)
Learn how to watch (ooh, yeah)
Learn how to watch (ooh, yeah)
Learn how to watch (hey, ooh)
Learn how to watch (skrrt skrrt, ooh)
