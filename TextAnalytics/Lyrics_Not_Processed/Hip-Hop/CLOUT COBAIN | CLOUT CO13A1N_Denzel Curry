[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, it's been so damn long, dealing with the things I've felt

[Chorus]
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella bass, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella bass, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain

[Verse 1]
I don't even know what to feel, they don't even know what's real
Dry tears with a dollar bill, I'm out tryna make a mill', oh
Why you wanna take my soul? I'm yelling out, "Hell no!"
I can't even trust my friends, most of them might be foes
Watch these hoes when they say they want a lot of me
I don't know who's the one that wanna plot on me
I stay low so my demons don't acknowledge me
When I go, I know death don't do apologies

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, it's been so damn long, dealing with the things I felt (Ayy)

[Chorus]
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella bass, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella bass, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain

[Verse 2]
Know when it rains, it pours,
 
they wanna go to war
For things that they can't afford,
 
I gotta grab the sword, preach
I gotta thank the Lord, I gotta go record (Heat)
I wanna be fly to soar 'cause niggas be trying to floor me
People be thinkin' that I won the lottery
So paranoid, I don't know who be plotting on me
Out of nowhere try to fight you
I'm feeling like Raichu 'cause everything shocking to me
Gotta beware of the wicked, the time will be ticking
Them niggas still clocking on me
Lord is my witness, I handle my business
You niggas ain't never ball blocking on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, it's been so damn long, dealing with the things I've felt

[Chorus]
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella bass, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain
Suicidal doors, call it Kurt Cobain
Suwoo leather seats, like a bloody stain
I need hella bass, I need hella pain
You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain

[Outro]
Clout Cobain, yeah
Clout Cobain, yeah
Clout Cobain
