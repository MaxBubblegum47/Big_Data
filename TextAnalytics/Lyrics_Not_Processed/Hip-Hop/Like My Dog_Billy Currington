[Verse 1]
He never tells me that he's sick of this house
He never says why don't you get off that couch?
He don't cost me nothing when he wants to go out
I want you to love me like my dog
He never says I need a new attitude
Him and my sister ain't always in a feud
When I leave the seat up he don't think that it's rude
I want you to love me like my dog does baby

[Chorus]
When I come home, want you to just go crazy
He never looks at me like he might hate me
I want you to love me like my dog

[Verse 2]
He never acts like he don't care for my friends
He never asks me where in the hell have you been?
He don't play dead when I want to pet him
I want you to love me like my dog does honey
He never says "I wish you made more money"
He always thinks that pull my finger's funny
I want you to love me like my dog
He don't get mad at me and throw a major fit
When I say his sister is a bitch

[Chorus]
When I come home, want you to just go crazy
He never looks at me like he might hate me
I want you to love me like my dog

[Outro]
I want you to love me like my dog does baby
