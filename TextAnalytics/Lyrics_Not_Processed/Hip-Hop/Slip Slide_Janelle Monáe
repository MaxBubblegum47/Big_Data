[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Heyyo Mr. Chance The Rapper, I greatly appreciate the way you roll out the red carpet, allowing me to articulate myself, and now I stand on my own two beloved. Yeah!

[Hook: The Social Experiment & Maceo of The O'My’s]
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I’m a man understanding the plan and I'm on
To be greater than'ything make you a fan in this song
How I stand out and wonderin’ what planet I’m gone
The one and only God of kings come from
A hundred grand on, a child I always ran from the wrong
Standing on his own two but wanna stand with the strong
Please get to turning on the fan cause it’s warm
While I build just a little 'bout the man I was born to be
This whole planet belongs to me
We all feel the same so it belongs to we
We talkin’ all night but this is my birth right
Please can you get to bringin’ the crown to me?
Yea I know you all for it
You’ll only be deemed worthy if you stand tall for it
When you and your men were sitting, yeah, I know you all saw it!
This great ship we got goin’ on
Don’t slip

[Hook: The Social Experiment & Maceo of The O'My’s]
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I was born on my own two feet watching Bruce Lee
‘Fore I grew teeth I had a pen and some loose leaf
Pots and pans when the roof leak
‘Fore I ever smoked mids ‘fore I ever blew trees
Used to drive a hoopdie that broke down on me usually
Nas was lookin’ at me, pockets was lookin’ through me
Never planned on college I dropped out as a student
My GPA started with a decimal like Dewey
That’s lower than low, that’s lower than most
But if you thought I wouldn’t make it, you slower than slow
I make the type of music that stoners should know
If I plant one of my thoughts marijuana would grow
And I be high enough to go where I wanted to go (Reefer)
Might be covered in glitter but all of it’s gold
A nigga got that loud and it's all for the low
And everybody sayin’ “aww, let’s go”

[Hook: The Social Experiment & Maceo of The O'My’s]
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two
I don't wanna slip, slip, slip, slide!
I'mma stand up on my own two
Stand up on my own two

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
It ain’t so easy
It’s not too hard
It ain’t so easy
But it’s not so hard
To stand up
Stand up
But it’s just too easy
To sit back down
