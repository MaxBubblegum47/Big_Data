[Verse 1: YG]
All up in my face, you not from the clique
Give me space, we might rob the shit
Most hate it, baby they don't love the clique
I thought they love you when you make it
This some other shit, yeah
Yeah, yeah, this some other shit
Friends and business don't mix so I'm brotherless
Tryna get back close, hit 'em with the stiff
Gears I shift, make sure they feel the drift
Just copped the Benzo with the tint
You should know cause in every song I said this shit
Yeah, in every song I said this shit
I'm just, I'm just proud of my accomplishments
I'm a 4Hunnid nigga, I don't care at all
Have her suck dick, lick the head and all
Heard you talkin' 'bout I'm real, I'm fraud
Your kids and broad, they straight, you shouldn't care at all

[Hook: Kamaiyah + YG]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Hunnid 4 times how it go down
Slaps on deck for the Oaktown
On mamas, man I did it with my own sound
And I got my own city that I hold down
Just admit it already
You got plans to do it, but we did it already
Got a couple DMs I done slid in already
Gotta ask YG if he hit it already, yeah
I'm a star like Moesha's nigga
Runnin' up the numbers like Ayesha's nigga
Yeah, I be slidin', I be creepin', nigga
Girls these days, they just don't know how to keep a nigga
But I got it all handled
They try to box me in, I got my own angles, yeah
I'ma spend the summer gettin' to the cake
And I'ma wish a nigga would on every candle
I'm like...

[Verse 3: YG]
If you ain't know me, bet you know now
Drizzy came through with the verse for me both times
Bomp-town that's an automatic hold down
What's that? Ask no questions, just hold it down
Why you hatin' on the progress?
I'm a humble nigga, I don't even pop shit
What I do?
I just drive the Maybach through the projects
And Still Brazy ain't even drop yet
Hate from a distance, please don't try me
Cause we'll turn it up on anybody
I see why they don't like me
Yellin' out 4Hunnid, they go too hyphy
I'm with the posse back at it, nigga
That mean Kamaiyah goin' platinum, nigga
That mean I got a Kindle in my mattress, nigga
Got the Bity Back Brackin' nigga
