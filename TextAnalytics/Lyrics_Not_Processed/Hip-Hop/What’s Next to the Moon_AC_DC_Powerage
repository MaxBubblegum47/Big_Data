[Verse 1]
Well, I tied my baby to the railroad track
Cannonball down the line
Givin' that woman just a one more chance
Give it to me one more time
Engineer wishin' he was home in bed
Dreamin' 'bout Casey Jones
Wide-eyed woman, half a mile ahead
Thinkin' 'bout broken bones

[Chorus]
It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love, gotta have
It's your love

[Verse 2]
Heavenly body flyin' 'cross the sky
Superman was outta town
Come on, honey, gotta change your tune
'Cause it's a long way down
Clark Kent lookin' for a free ride
Think about Lois Lane
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a suicide
And that'd be a shame

[Chorus]
It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love, gotta have
It's your love
But what's next to the moon?

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Long arm lookin' for a finger print
Tryna find a mystery clue
Hittin' me with the third degree
Workin' on the thumbscrew
Alright, officer, I confess
Everything's comin' back
I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
It was a heart attack

[Chorus]
It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love, gotta have
It's your love guaranteed
The love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love, gotta have
It's your love
What's next to the moon?
Movin' round the skies...
Oh, baby, say "bye-bye"
You're right next to the moon
And on the moon
Oh, I've been around the moon
