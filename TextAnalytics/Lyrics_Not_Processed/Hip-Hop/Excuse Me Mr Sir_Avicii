[Verse 1]
Checking, checking, microphone checking
I'll tell you what you need to know
Holla, holla, gotta make a dollar
Time to put on a show
Many, many, one too many
People try to fill my shoes
But see ya, see ya, see ya 'round later
I'm about to make a move

[Chorus]
I'm a roller coaster beyond belief
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now
I'm a riot walking down the street
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm a villain, villain 'bout to make a million
One too many records sold (That's why I'm)
Chillin' while I keep on building
See you fuckers down the road (Ah)
Better, better, feeling much better
Tonight, I'll do it all again (Cop that)
Ticking, ticking, time keeps ticking
I'm rolling up till the end
Bring it back now

[Chorus]
I'm a roller coaster beyond belief
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now
I'm a riot walking down the street
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Excuse me, Mr. Sir
I don't understand a word
Your inquiries are none of my concern
Excuse me, Mr. Sir
I don't understand your world
With all due respect, I best be on my way

[Outro]
I'm what you need, what you really, really
I'm what, I'm what you need, what you really, really
I'm what, I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now
I'm what you need, what you really, really
I'm what, I'm what you need, what you really, really
I'm what, I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now
