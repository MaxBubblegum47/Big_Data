[Verse 1]
I've been crucified, darling
Ghosts haunt me like New Orleans
I've been charged with murder
Need someone to push me further
I'll hit you where it hurts, yeah
If you don't put me first, yeah
And I don't give no apologies
If you lose a life, that's not on me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Better, baby, better treat me better
Better than those other guys who change up like the weather, yeah
It is such a shame that they went missing, they can't find 'em now
Oh, I wonder how I accidentally put them in the ground, yeah

[Chorus]
I might be a little tipsy on your love
Makes me a little crazy, but so what?
You're strumming on my heartstrings, don't be dumb
If you love your little life, then don't fuck up

[Verse 2]
I'll take you to the afterlife
Boy, if you ain't actin' right
Key your car and crash the lights
Hit your head, I'm not polite
Then I'll hunt down your family
Let 'em know 'bout the tragedy
Who did it? A mystery
But you know that it, it was me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Better, baby (Babe), better treat me better (Babe)
Better than those other guys who change up like the weather, yeah
It is such a shame that they went missing, they can't find 'em now
Oh, I wonder how I accidentally put them in the ground, yeah

[Chorus]
I might be a little tipsy on your love
Makes me a little crazy, but so what?
You're strumming on my heartstrings, don't be dumb
If you love your little life, then don't fuck up

[Bridge]
Don't you mess up
Don't you mess up, baby, no
Don't be dumb, boy
In your ear like a radio
I'm a bad girl
Shake a lil' ass if you're crazy, yeah
We just havin' fun

[Outro]
Oh, I might be a little tipsy on your love (Dum, dum, dum)
If you love your little life, then don't fuck up
