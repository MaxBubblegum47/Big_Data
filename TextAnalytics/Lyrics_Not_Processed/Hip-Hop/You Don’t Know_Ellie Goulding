[Intro]
You know what you do
You know what you do
You know what you see
You know what you do
You know what you - you don't know what you do!

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
How about we pretend all these niggas not around
And get fucked up like we was out of town
Woah, then get fucked up and go get out of town
Swerve, swerve
And tell ourselves that one time doesn't count, tell me
How fucked up you down to get?
A pound? A zip? A thousand sips
Red cup yeah that college shit
Free liquor got it on scholarship
Bitch act like you don't know what's up
Act like it ain't my crew blowing up
Lose not to much champagne, no throwing up
One time for the set, please go throw it up
It's Finally Famous, overbooked, overpaid and overpriced
But don't get it twisted, that shit ain't happen overnight
Had dreams of balling now I'm NFLing
Let her spend the night, she feel like Cinderella
All she tell me is-

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
You don't know what you-

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get dressed up
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get messed up
Heart breaker, young heart breaker
When you get in the game I swear the whole world commentates you
But man, I don't give a fuck what they saying, I don't give a fuck about opinions
I don't give a fuck about feelings, I ain't no dentist, either I did, I do or I didn't
You could try to tell me how to live my life, I ain't hearing it
I must be doing something right if every mill comes with a spare I guess
Straight, straight, straight up out that dirt, but my t-shirt clean, ohh
Do it for the city, that's the 313
That's unnecessary, fuck her like she my secretary
Ass and face is hereditary, her momma, shit, legendary
You don't know what you do

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
You don't know what you-

[Outro: Big Sean]
Go, go, go, go. go
Can't let that high go to waste I feel high on
Supposed, supposed, supposed, supposed, supposed
Man, watch your back I swear man some of these niggas be
Hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes
But I'mma live this like I swear that's all I know
Know, know, know, know, know, know
