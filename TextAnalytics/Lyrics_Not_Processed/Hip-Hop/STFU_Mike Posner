[Verse 1: blackbear]
Oh, yeah
I ain't hit you back and now you ovary-acting
Hate that shit with a passion, yeah
Have a little self respect, don't want to put you on blast
But you should go 'head and practice

[Chorus: blackbear]
Shut the fuck up right now and let me breathe
Shut the fuck up right now, let me do my thing
Slow down, slow down, slow down
Quit hitting my phone up, quit hitting my phone up
Quit hitting my phone, slow down

[Verse 2: blackbear & 
Mike Posner
]
I ain't hit you back, now you ovary-acting
I don't play that elastic
You be like, "When we gon' fuck? What we gon' do?"
You should try and quit asking, huh
You should shut the fuck up right now and let me be me
(Let me be, let me be)
Shut the fuck up right now, let me do my thing

[Verse 3: Mike Posner]
People talk too much shit in my face
'Round my back, on the phone
Ain't been famous for a while but I'm still up in my zone
And I don't usually smoke, but I'm high on sativa
There's mugwort in my tea
, I smell like heaven, I'm a diva
Bangin' Aaliyah so loud in my speaker that I cannot hear you, no,
 I'm gone
Don't you be blowin' up my phone, I'm in a different time zone
Ever since a matter of time, all my girls is badder than nine
Hope to banish the debt
You hammered, you still don't know how to handle your wine
That's probably why you're hittin' me more
Yeah, I've got a rule 'cause I've done this before
Just fuck 'em three times and don't fuck 'em no more
'Cause they just fall in love if you fuck 'em the fourth
Don't get me wrong, I really like it when we're vibin'
But when I'm in another city, shh, be quiet

[Chorus: blackbear]
Shut the fuck up right now and let me be me
Shut the fuck up right now, let me do my thing
Slow down, slow down, slow down
Quit hitting my phone up, quit hitting my phone up
Quit hitting my phone, slow down

[Bridge: blackbear]
And I've been off the coke, I've been off the coke
I've been off this coke
Always ringing phone, always ringing phone
Always ringing phone

[Verse 4: Spark Master Tape]
She constantly callin' my old bitch
Get up, be gone, and go home, bitch
Quit playin' with all of my phone, bitch
Switch numbers, even my wrong shit
These chicks, they cunnin'
Flip cities, she sticks, still on it
Switched whips, where wake, she saw it
This bitch on my ass, like a pair of my drawers
Any phone I ever own, she call it
She call me at 2, call me at 3
Check I'm a wakkeboi, fukk I gon' be
Wanna grab an eight ball, set your nigga free
Then she walk with a nose bleed on her blue jeans
Dumb bitch, dumb hoe
Don't call my phone, go home
We jettin' out 'till we made it
Shut the fuck up complainin'

[Chorus: blackbear & 
Spark Master Tape
]
Shut the fuck up right now and let me be me
(Ayy, shut the fuck up bitch)
Shut the fuck up right now, let me do my thing
(It's true, but it's simple)
Slow down, slow down, slow down
(Have a Xanny, SWOUP)
Quit hitting my phone up, quit hitting my phone up
(Quit hittin' up my fuckin' phone)
Quit hitting my phone, slow down 
(SWOUP)
