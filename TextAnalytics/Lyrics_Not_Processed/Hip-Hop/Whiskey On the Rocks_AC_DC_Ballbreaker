[Intro]
Ooh
I've been drinking all night long
So long, baby, I'm gone

[Verse 1]
Ooh, yeah
Well, Bloody Mary give me shiver from a shot
Set up the shooters, it's time for a drop
Gimme Old Jamaica, running we come
Down at the hatch, Jack, the women and the fun

[Pre-Chorus]
We drink a lot
That demon drop
This one's on me and here's to you

[Chorus]
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixir from the top

[Verse 2]
You went drinking Mai Tais, Singapore sling
Beam me up, Jim, it's time to come in
I'll have one more a-fore ya close up the door
It's on the house, Mac, it's whiskey galore

[Pre-Chorus]
We drink a lot of that demon drop
This one's on me, here's mud in your eye

[Chorus]
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixir from the top

[Bridge]
He's gone seven sheets to the wind
(Ha-ha-ha)
Fill him up, Joe!

[Solo]
Lock the door

[Chorus]
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixir from the top

[Chorus]
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixir from the top

[Outro]
I'm drinkin'
Whiskey on the rocks
I'll have my whiskey on the rocks
Gimme whiskey on the rocks
Keep it comin' on the rocks
Yeah
Pour me a double, here come trouble (Whiskey on the rocks)
Whiskey on the rocks
