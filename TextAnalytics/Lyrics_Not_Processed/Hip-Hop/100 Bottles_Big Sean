[Hook: Chris Brown]
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles

Stuntin' is my motto with 200 bad models
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
I need 100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
Stuntin' is my motto with 200 bad models

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
100 fuckin' bottles, I wanna fuck a model
I got her on Patron, she open like a novel
I told her make it wobble while I grab her from behind
Then she made it whine, so I ordered some Moscato
A couple hookers and a bucket of that Rosé
We up in this bitch, niggas grillin' like chipotle
20 bottles waters, cranberry and some OJ
Throw that money in the air and watch it fall like a snow flake
I smell like Kush and Dolce
I'm on that gin & juice and I'm feelin' like the old Dre
I'll be lyin' if I say I wasn't drunk
It feels like I smoked 100 blunts and I ordered like

[Hook: Chris Brown]
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
Stuntin' is my motto with 200 bad models
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
I need 100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
Stuntin' is my motto with 200 bad models

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Oh my God waiter, we packed up in this bitch
And I’m feelin' hater vapors, yeah, it’s hot up in this bitch
But, but you won’t ever phase me and I know why you hate me
'Cause my fuckin' cleanin' lady look hotter than your bitch
And you know I'm 'bout to spend 100 racks up on this bar, bar
You don’t wanna drink, you wanna be nosy Mrs. Aardvark
And I know that you not used to rejection
But if you don’t get naked, get the fuck up out my section

[Hook: Chris Brown]
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
Stuntin' is my motto with 200 bad models
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles

Stuntin' is my motto with 200 bad models

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
You know I do it the biggest
Got these bitch niggas hatin', got these bad bitches jizzin'
Holdin' down my city, but I pick up that commission
Boy, I run my city so you might need my permission
I'm just champagne pissin'? Drink it 'til I might drown
Seen her in a weddin' dress, I've seen her in her night gown
Boy, she take me out to eat, while you'll be tryna eat her out
Got 100 fuckin' bottles, boing with my weiner out, damn right, I got 100 fuckin' bottles

[Hook: Chris Brown]
100 fuckin' bottles, 100 fuckin' bottles
