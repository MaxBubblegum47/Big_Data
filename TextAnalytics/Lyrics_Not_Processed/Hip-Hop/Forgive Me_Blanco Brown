[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I been thuggin my whole fuckin' life
One look at my babygirl I had to get it right
Superman in these streets hey but you my kryptonite
Im on this drink I’m on this smoke I’m going super crip tonight
Something like a scientist, I mix it like it's antidote
Then I sent that 8 ball down the block Scrappy Loc
Rest in peace to Pookie Loc blame it on me never snitching
Lord knows I ain't send the homie on no dummy mission
Want to be like Uncle Wade can't believe I sold him crack
Still a hero in my eyes he up in heaven tell him that
Don’t tell me how to raise my son just know he gone be a man
If the scale of 1-10, know he gone be a grand
Before I stand with flaw niggas I would rather stand alone
Till I’m  stand, on the top like what he standing on
They say that I'm wishy washy ain't nobody perfect though
They say Young you growing up hope they know you worth it though

[Chorus]
The shit I’m smoking on got me trippin' please forgive me
The shit I’m sippin' on got me trippin' will you forgive me
Look you in your eyes when I’m talking know you hear me
Just listen to the words to the song I know you feel me
Cause ain't nobody perfect in this world please forgive me
Shit I’m smoking on got me trippin' will you forgive me
Look you in your eyes when I’m talking know you hear me
The shit I’m smoking on got me trippin' please forgive me

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
I ain't them and they ain't me maybe that’s the disconnect
I do my tequila straight but I do not do disrespect
You know I remind them though forgetful niggas they forget
Before the deal I had a check and I put that on the set
Breaking units down in fatty room, white mountains on the dresser
'Give me Auntie Sarah when we fell out look I knew was stressful
Wasn’t for you I ride on them look we in a rival gang
Screaming fuck the other side, guess that just a rival thing
100 dollars re'ing up back then we always talked but since the fame ain't been the same
Forgive me Mrs Brenda Ross, nah not your nephew acting like a rap nigga
Like I ain’t sit on your front porch talk shit and trap with you
You asked me to help with your wedding, argument in front your kids
Hurts me to the very day, lamest shit I ever did
So please forgive me lil sister because I know I hurt your soul
Your husband is a lucky man I hope he know you worth it though

[Chorus]
The shit I’m smoking on got me trippin' please forgive me
The shit I’m sippin' on got me trippin' will you forgive me
Look you in your eyes when I’m talking know you hear me
Just listen to the words to the song I know you feel me
Cause ain't nobody perfect in this world please forgive me
Shit I’m smoking on got me trippin' will you forgive me
Look you in your eyes when I’m talking know you hear me
The shit I’m smoking on got me trippin' please forgive me
