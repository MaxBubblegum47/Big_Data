[Intro]
We're not against rap, we're not against rappers
But we are against those thugs (thugs, thugs, thugs)

[Hook: Shatasha Williams]
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
You're feelin' the strength of the rump, step up
Hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin', straight buzzin'
Lovin' your peoples cause we so real
Chill, better bring your weapon when steppin'
Bring on that ammunition, trip and don't slip
Not to mention, never knew no competition
But I gotta get mine
So scream out "Mo'!" and let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone, Mo' Thugs will follow
Chain gang remaining the same
Flaming my dank and drinking brew
Thinking about that hanging, clocking my bank
And thuggin' with trues, foo's

[Hook: Shatasha Williams]
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

[Verse 2: Wish Bone]
Get ready for the Bone and the Mo' Thug
Bustas, you know me as a hustla
Try to creep and get beat
Maybe six feet, peep, gotta put them under
Straitjackets, gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Bailin' in my black trench vest
You gotta be down to bang-bang
Come and get this teaching
You soldiers how thugstas must stack
Me drinkin' me brew 'til me skull crack
Wig blew all the way back

[Hook: Shatasha Williams]
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Now follow me now, roll, stroll off deep in the land
Well creep if you can
Take another swig to the brain rose
Loc'in, steady chokin' off that potent smoke
And running from the po-po now
Gotta get up with my thugstas
Right turn to the double Glock
Pull to the curb, smoke with my hustlas
Puff puff to the brain, shot
Love P-O-D'd and tweeded
Gotta get another case for my trunk
Olde English, really don't need it
But in case my trues wanna get drunk
They pump Bone
So leave 'em alone, you don't wanna get shut down
Thug runnin' the nine-quad
And you better believe they be running this thug style
So what now? See the Bone Thug clank
Thug never gonna change so flame up
Sit back and just smoke to the same cut
Leatherface on the creep and I came up

[Hook: Shatasha Williams]
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
Gotta give it on up to the Glock-Glock
Pop-pop, better drop when them buckshot blow!
The Bone in me never no hoe so
No creepin' up outta the Ziplock
So Sin sip gin
And Lil Mo Hart run up, nut up and flipped in
Then slipped in the clip in
Next click and me blood the victim
Ever to test nuts, to the chest and put 'em to rest and
But I won't test bucks
Put a hole up into me vest and
Gotta get through my soul but they won't budge
Mug, drug, me picked em
The blood in me running my mental
The thug in me stuck in me keeping it simple
The Thug in me running with thugs so
To the temple, buck when you duck
To the thuggish ruggish T's
St. Clair P's to appeal to the G's
And a buck to all my enemies

[Hook: Shatasha Williams]
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Boooooone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

[Outro: Shatasha Williams]
We got Layzie, and Krayzie
Bizzy's in the house, Wish is in the house
And Flesh, and Shatasha
Cleveland, definitely in the house
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Boooooone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Boooooone
