[Intro]
Wheezy Outta Here!
Yeah

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Roadrunnin' like we getting rowdy to the West
Fly Away that's just the bird up on my chest
Duckin' shots from the feds cop the vest (It's Lit)
Gs with me, me and my niggas on a quest
I'm Outside, Outside with the Blues
Outside, with the HC niggas runnin' shoots
Outside with the loot, outside with the goons
Outside with no frauds, all my niggas getting loose
All my niggas get the juice, FIll me up, yeah
.40 runs out my coupe, we got guns, yeah
Niggas sprayin' take a prick up through your thumbs
We get wild, we get crazy, we get dumb, Yeah Yeah
(We get wild)
We get wild, we get crazy, we get dumb, Yeah Yeah
(We get wild)

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She my Lois Lane, I'm her Superman
She's tryna go to Spain, I'm wildin' in Japan
She off the candy cane, I'm stayin' Super Sayan
She always go insane, when I'm off with the gang
She my Lois Lane, I'm her Superman
She's tryna go to Spain, I'm wildin' in Japan
She off the candy cane, I'm stayin' Super Sayan
She always go insane, when I'm off with the gang, yeah
She my Lois– Superman
