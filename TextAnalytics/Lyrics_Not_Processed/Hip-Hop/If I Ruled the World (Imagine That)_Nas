[Intro: Nas]
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters, 
no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, 
these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing, fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with 
diamond Roles
Your people holding dough
, no parole, 
no rubbers
Go in raw
, imagine 
law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"

[
Chorus
: 
Lauryn Hill
 + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world
 (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, 
Lost Tribe of Shabazz
, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast
, 
dime sexes
 and 
Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl
, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, 
I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, 
purple M3's
 and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons
, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse 3: Nas]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
â€˜Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies 
or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons,
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em, love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons
Black diamonds, I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em, love 'em baby!
