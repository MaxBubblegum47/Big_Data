[Chorus]
I'm plottin' up a homicide when I'm out to ride
I'm grippin' on my forty-five, keep it by my side
You know I'm always down to slide when it's do-or-die
I'm just a hustler and a player with a deadly vice
I'm plottin' up a homicide when I'm out to ride
I'm grippin' on my forty-five, keep it by my side
You know I'm always down to slide when it's do-or-die
I'm just a hustler and a player with a deadly vice

[Verse 1]
I'm comin', late-night creepin', finger on the trigger, never sleepin'
No sucker, cop ducker, go 'head, bitch, give me reason
To break yo' ass off with the forty-five I'm squeezin'
Gurpin' on this skunk that my partner grew up last season
Hooker left and now you see me rollin' through the boulevard
Shakin' hands and kissin' babies, Rami' been the ghetto star
Say, young player, let me tell you 'bout them days
Where we never had shit, but now a nigga get paid, huh
Pullin' up in somethin' clean, fresher than Listerine
I pop my collar 'cause stackin' money, man, ain't no thing
Shake junt hoes, send the money through the Western Union
Thirty thousand dollars from a duffel bag I sent to Houston

[Chorus]
I'm plottin' up a homicide when I'm out to ride
I'm grippin' on my forty-five, keep it by my side
You know I'm always down to slide when it's do-or-die
I'm just a hustler and a player with a deadly vice
I'm plottin' up a homicide when I'm out to ride
I'm grippin' on my forty-five, keep it by my side
You know I'm always down to slide when it's do-or-die
I'm just a hustler and a player with a deadly vice

[Verse 2]
Catch the nine-six rollin', laid back, smokin'
Rainbow in my double cup, sippin' up on the potion
Fuck all of the playa hatin', keep all that commotion
Me and my partners about the dollars, never been about no ho shit
FTP across my chest, bangin' 'til the day I rest
When they lay me in my coffin, light one from that buddha cess
I'm dippin' low on a hundred golden spokes
Live, comin' out the gutter just to let you busters know

[Pre-Chorus]
It ain't no thing but a chicken wing
Draco bustin' out the frame, somethin' you can't tame
You better duck up out the way when them guns go bang
I'll leave you suckers bloody red, soakin' in the rain

[Chorus]
I'm plottin' up a homicide when I'm out to ride
I'm grippin' on my forty-five, keep it by my side
You know I'm always down to slide when it's do-or-die
I'm just a hustler and a player with a deadly vice
I'm plottin' up a homicide when I'm out to ride
I'm grippin' on my forty-five, keep it by my side
You know I'm always down to slide when it's do-or-die
I'm just a hustler and a player with a deadly vice

[Bridge]
Swervin' in, pop a Xan', scopin' out my infrared
Hit the blunt to calm my nerves, makin' sure my money dance
Swervin' in, pop a Xan', scopin' out my infrared
Hit the blunt to calm my nerves, makin' sure my money dance
Swervin' in, pop a Xan', scopin' out my infrared
Hit the blunt to calm my nerves, makin' sure my money dance
Swervin' in, pop a Xan', scopin' out my infrared
Hit the blunt to calm my nerves, makin' sure my money dance

[Chorus]
I'm plottin' up a homicide when I'm out to ride
I'm grippin' on my forty-five, keep it by my side
You know I'm always down to slide when it's do-or-die
I'm just a hustler and a player with a deadly vice
I'm plottin' up a homicide when I'm out to ride
I'm grippin' on my forty-five, keep it by my side
You know I'm always down to slide when it's do-or-die
I'm just a hustler and a player with a deadly vice (Deadly vice)

[Outro]
Swervin' in, pop a Xan', scopin' out my infrared
Hit the blunt to calm my nerves, makin' sure my money dance
Swervin' in, pop a Xan', scopin' out my infrared
Hit the blunt to calm my nerves, makin' sure my money dance
