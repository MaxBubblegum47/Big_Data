[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again
And wait
Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again
And wait
Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again
And wait
Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again

[Verse 1: JOBA]
Meet me outside
It'll be alright
Got drugs and we can share
Let's lose our mind tonight

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I'm a slave to my feelings, uh
I made bread with my niggas, uh
I see that man in the mirror, uh
And I've been dying to kill him, uh

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
I told my nigga I'm good, mm
If you got it, you should, uh
I was addicted to wood, uh
I'm coming straight off the Suge, uh
School had doubted the bosses, ay
Sick of counting my losses, uh
We kept our hands in the closet, uh
I kept my heart in the faucet, uh
He took the train and was off it, uh
My balance stuck in his pocket, uh
Relax and be easy, uh
I taught you, I'm weaker, uh

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again
And wait
Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again
And wait
Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again
And wait
Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again
And wait

[Verse 4: JOBA]
Spent the night outside your house
Drunk as ever, can't get better, and can't do better
You say I treat you like a sidepiece
Bought a Beretta, fuck a fella
Dressed in all black tryna find a way back to your mattress
Where I can relax
Where we would just laugh
I could kill him, don't like to play the villain
But I've been feeling bent
I cross my heart and hope to love
What's wrong with that?

[Verse 5: Merlyn Wood]
(Can you turn me up on my headphones?)
Treat me like a kook, the weather getting good
Mans will manifest, they gon' see the way I cook
I said it with my chest and became a different dude
Skrt off in the Hemi
Work hard, not for pennies
Imma make that money if I'm outside sellin' green
Just for Japanese denim
I gotta be fresher than you
Last year I was destitute
