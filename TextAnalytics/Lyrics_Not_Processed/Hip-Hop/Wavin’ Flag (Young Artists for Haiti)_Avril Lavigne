[Intro: All Artists]
When I get older
I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom
Just like a waving flag

[Verse 1: K'naan]
Born from a throne, older than Rome
But violent prone, poor people zone

[Nelly Furtado]
But it's my home, all I have known

[Sam Roberts]
Where I got grown, but now it's gone

[Avril Lavigne]
Out of the darkness, in came the carnage
Threatening my very survival

[Pierre Bouvier of Simple Plan]
Fractured my streets and broke all my dreams

[Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman]
Now feels like defeat to wretched retreat

[Pre-Chorus: All Artists]
So we struggling

[Kardinal Offishall]
Fighting to eat

[All Artists]
And we wondering

[Kardinal Offishall]
If we'll be free

[Jully Black]
We can not wait for some faithful day
It’s too far away so right now I’ll say

[Chorus: All Artists]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

[Verse 2: Lights]
So many wars, settling scores

[Deryck Whibley of Sum 41]
All that we've been through and now there is more

[Serena Ryder]
I hear them say love is the way

[Jacob Hoggard of Hedley]
Love is the answer that's what they say

[Emily Haines of Metric]
But were not just dreamers of broken down grievers

[Hawsley Workman]
A hand will reach us and will not forsake us

[Drake]
This can't control us, no it can’t hold us down

[Chin Injeti]
We gon' pick it up even though we still struggling

[Pre-Chorus: Pierre Lapointe]
Au nom de la survie

[All Artists]
And we wondering

[Pierre Lapointe]
Battant pour nos vie

[All Artists]
We patiently wait for some other day

[Fefe Dobson and Esthero]
That's too far away so right now I say

[Chorus: All Artists]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

[Verse 3: Drake]
How come when the media stops covering
And there’s a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling
And assume that its really all love again, nah
See we don’t have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren't involved before, it’s never too late to start
You probably think that it’s too far to even have to care
Well, take a look at where you live, what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again

[Chorus: Nikki Yanofsky]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag

[Matt Mays]
And then it goes back

[Justin Nozuka]
And then it goes back

[Nikki Yanofsky]
Then it goes back

[All Artists]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
When I get older, when I get older
I will be stronger, just like a waving flag
