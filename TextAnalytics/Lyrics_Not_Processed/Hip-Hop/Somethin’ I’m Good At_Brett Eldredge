[Intro]
Get ready to go crazy right here
Here we go

[Verse 1]
I'm a real bad liar, I'm a burnt toast kinda guy
And if I try to build a fire I'll burn the woods
I ain't a mover or a shaker, can't keep up with the pacer
Never met a dancefloor that ever did me any good

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at

[Verse 2]
I got a poor sense of direction, sometimes too strong of affection
For a whiskey made in Lynchburg, Tennessee (That's right)
If there's a hole in my boat son, you bet that's all she wrote
I'm a Titanic sinking down into that deep blue sea

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at

[Bridge 1]
Playin' hard to get are ya?
Let me tell ya a little more about ya, and why I love ya

[Verse 3]
Damn you're a looker
You're the cane, you're the sugar
Jiffy Pop in the cooker
You're the author of the book
That I'm reading (Ain't ya baby?)
You're the moon, you're the sky
You're the apple of my eye
Make me laugh 'til I cry
Till I think I'm gonna die
Turn me upside down
Spin me around
Spend all my money on you all over this town

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that? (Would you look at that?)
I finally found somethin' I'm really good at

You thought it was over?

[Bridge 2]
Oh my mine
I'm such a lucky guy
You got me tongue tied
Like Jekyll and Hyde
I'm coming undone
I'm born to run
I got my shades on
Here comes the sun
All cotton pickin'
My tick tocks tickin'
I love I'm stricken'
I'm flip flop flippin'
I'm 'bout to cuss
Son of a bus
I can't stop singin'
I'm havin' way too much fun

[Chorus]
I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm so good at

[Outro]
Hahaha
Cut!
