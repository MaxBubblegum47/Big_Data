[Intro: Sheff G]
Feelin' pressure
I know they feelin' the pressure
I know they feelin' the pressure

[Verse 1: Sheff G]
I just been feelin' alone, told her to leave me alone
I want you around matter of fact no I don’t
Indecisive, I know, huh
Rappin' just gave me a passage to deliver the message
I want you dress off, get you on the mattress
Really wasn't a mattress
Niggas ain't really ya mans niggas ain't really ya mans
Cross me, I bet you won't do it again, huh
You better stay in your frame, better you stay in your lane
They funny, don't chill with them
Bitches ain't wifey material, ain't wifey material, huh
Word to my mother, I got it, you got it, you spittin' to save me, huh
I used to trap out the hoopty on mornin'
Don't let me, just say your prayers
I put the shit that I shock you forever, might wake up your inner demon
Might change how you view your peoples
Won't change how you see the system
I swear my brothers don't gotta go tourin'
'Cause I'm pickin' on everything for 'em
Devil was callin', I couldn't ignore him
Please do not beef if you cannot afford it
Swear to my mother, I'm never gon' change
Still, I know they gon' lie on my name
Stupid people done pay for the game, game, game

[Verse 2: Sleepy Hallow]
I know they feelin' the pressure
How you finesse a finesser?
Full price, I don't want any lesser
Back up the choppers if they try to test us
Now, you know I don't rest 'till the bag full
You want smoke? I got Backwoods
Really do it, I don't gotta act hood
I know shawty a baddie, but act good
And you don't want be the one
Flex on the gang, get turned to a t-shirt
Double back on your block, ain't no reverse
How we do it? They thinkin' we rehearse
And she know I came from the bottom so she gotta give me the top first
If I call you my bro, then I got 'em
Just tell me the problem, we makin' that shit work

[Outro: Sleepy Hallow]
Call you my bro, then I got 'em
Just-, we makin' that shit work
