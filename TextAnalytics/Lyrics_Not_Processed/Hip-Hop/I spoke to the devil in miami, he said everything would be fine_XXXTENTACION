[Intro]
It will all be over soon

[Verse]
And I'm always where the
Sun don't shine, the tears don't show
Won't hurt me now 'cause heart's been broke
I hate myself, but it won't show
I constantly lose all my remorse
And it's 10 for the wolf and three for the shepherd
And it's one for the sheep who led by your leopard
Often gave his perception as a handle of weapon
Took a bite of your apple, give me all you can offer
Now I'm trapped in a changing maze, setting my soul ablaze
Couldn't control the pace, where is this going?
Hey, heartless is recklessness, it's word of a pacifist
To word of a masochist, I'm off of the map
My Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he said he would save me
If I gave him one thing he needed, "What is this thing?", I pleaded
Boy, it's the key to even
Yeah

[Outro]
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine"
