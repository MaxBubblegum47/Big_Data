[Intro]
All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don't break 'em for no one, you understand?

[Verse 1]
Lookin' in the mirror and I'm liking what I see
Thought I told ya'll once before, can't nobody fuck with me
I was raised in B-A-Y but was made in S-A-C
Man the glo up been too real, bet ya'll likin' what ya'll see
Yeah, my mama is a soldier and my daddy is a G
When you put them two together, what you think that made me?
She had me at 17, made it work, she did her thing
Yeah, you did it, love you mama, look how I turned out to be
I did two years in Diego and did three at USC
That's a beauty, that's a beast, I bet her brain is so OD
Said a prayer to the Lord, keep me safe from enemies
Then I start losing friends, I thank God for clarity, uh

[Chorus]
Focused, keep me focused
All these little things man, they keep me focused
Focused, keep me focused
All these little things man, they keep me focused

[Verse 2:]
Any nigga play or disrespect me, he regret me, wish he kept me
People question how they lost me, make it hard, they can't forget me
Wasn't she with so and so? Now she out with who and who?
Niggas hate when you go do what they would do if they was you
I said I'm married to the game 'cause the blood that's in my veins
No, my father ain't no pimp but he taught me the pimp way
Can't no nigga disrespect you, keep these hoes up in they place
You know you doing something right when they love you out of hate
I said my father ain't no pimp but he taught me the pimp way
Can't no nigga disrespect you, keep these hoes up in they place
You know you doing something right when they love you out of hate
You see I read between the lines, I know yo' praise was really shade, nigga

[Chorus]
Focused, keep me focused
All these little things man, they keep me focused
Focused, keep me focused
All these little things man, they keep me focused
