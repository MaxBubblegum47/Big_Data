[Verse 1]
He be the count of Monte Cristo
Could be a quake any day
Maybe somebody from Siam
Begin the era of a new Reich

[Pre-Chorus]
Keeps licking all the honey
Chewing up the fat he rakes
Instead of sending to the lions
They cover him with praise

[Chorus]
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!

[Verse 2]
Down at the epicenter, things started heatin' up
Rocking up the Richter scale
Swinging in the chariot, around and around, we go
The senators rehearse the tale

[Pre-Chorus]
Starring in the coliseum
Tied upon the rack
Up, comes the thumb of Caesar
To stab you in the back

[Chorus]
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Down at the epicenter, things started heatin' up
Rocking on the Richter scale
Swingin' in the chariot, around and around, we go
As the senators rehearse the tale
Watch out, Caesar
Watch out, Caesar
I said, "Hail"
I said, "Hail"
I said, "Hail"
I said, "Hail"

Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!

Hail!
Hail!
Hail!

[Chorus]
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!

[Chorus]
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!

[Outro]
You need eyes in the back of your head, boy
Or you're dead
