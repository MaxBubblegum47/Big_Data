[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Oh yo yo yo yo yo yo
Me take a puff and then me watch for the po-po
That's cause me wantin no encounter with the 5-0

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Smoke, smoke, smoke, until you choke
I'm gettin a buzz, and buyin' the grub
I'm goin broke for the good thai
So, nigga, just pass me the bud
I'm a fiend for the green leaves
Yeah I got the cheese, G's
I need some weed, so pass me the trees, please
Now roll a huddha, cause it'll surely do ya
You say that weed ain't doin' shit
Don't let the buddah fool ya

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Now, Krayzie Bone is rollin' a huddah
I pick it up, take a puff, and then me drop
Me smokin' the dank, me smokin' the pot
Me smokin' the sess, but never the rock
And every ten dollars I get
I'm goin to purchase a sack, and then I kick back
I'm keepin' that one to myself to roll up a fat spliff
And then I relax
I never knew no one who smoke up a fifty-sack like me
And yes, me need some weed, and, why?
Cause we be fiendin'

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Me smokin' 'em up, me smokin' 'em up
Cause me be schemin'
Me takin' a puff, me rough
And tough enough when me be fiendin'
Me smoke and choke
Been hopin' it goin' straight to the chest
Because the monkey paw
The sess'll get that mind buddah blessed
So me hit, and then me cough
And then me start to be dreamin'
Me want it more, we want it more
Cause me be fiendin'

[Outro]
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Oh yo yo yo yo yo yo
Me take a puff and then me watch for they po-po
That's cause me wantin no encounter with the 5-0
