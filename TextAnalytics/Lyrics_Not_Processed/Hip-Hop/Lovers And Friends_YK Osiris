[Chorus]
Tell me would you ride for me 'til the very end?
You ain't gotta tell nobody, I'm your lover, I'm your friend
I'ma pull off in the Rari, we gon' leave off in the Benz
Just tell me what it is, am I your lover or your friend?
Tell me would you ride for me 'til the very end?
You ain't gotta tell nobody, I'm your lover, I'm your friend
I'ma pull off in the Rari, we gon' leave off in the Benz
Just tell me what it is, if you my lover or my friend

[Verse 1]
Baby girl you the baddest baby
Anything, you can have it, baby
When we fuckin', you's a savage baby
You know you want it, you can grab it
'Cause you's a ten out of ten, whoa whoa
You can have anything, oh-oh
We gon' pull off in a Benz
You know I win, you gon' win, yeah yeah, yeah
Baby girl you the baddest, yeah yeah
Anything you can have it, yeah yeah
Baby girl you the baddest, yeah yeah
No, no, no, no no no

[Chorus]
Tell me would you ride for me 'til the very end?
You ain't gotta tell nobody, I'm your lover, I'm your friend
I'ma pull off in the Rari, we gon' leave off in the Benz
Just tell me what it is, am I your lover or your friend?
Tell me would you ride for me 'til the very end?
You ain't gotta tell nobody, I'm your lover, I'm your friend
I'ma pull off in the Rari, we gon' leave off in the Benz
Just tell me what it is, if you my lover or my friend, oh no no

[Verse 2]
I might just throw back this perky and take a trip to Venus
That time I said I don't love you, girl I ain't really mean it
Why would you tell me you love me if you don't really mean it?
I got a show out in Texas, I might just gotta in
Keep it one hundred, I keep it a million
When I look in your eyes, I can tell how you feelin'
If you see it and want it, you know I'ma spend it
Gucci and Fendi, I buy it from Lenox
Came a long long way from the project's business
Brand new bust down iced out Rollies
You said that you love me, why don't you just show me?
Buy you a Mercedes and give you the door key
Bick back, bick back, ballin' like Kobe
When it's cold I just want you to hold me
These niggas be talkin', don't even really know me
It's off the love, baby girl you don't owe me
Chosen one, baby you are my trophy
Promise you gon' ride to the end
This that new Osiris and that QRN

[Chorus]
Tell me would you ride for me 'til the very end?
You ain't gotta tell nobody, I'm your lover, I'm your friend
I'ma pull off in the Rari, we gon' leave off in the Benz
Just tell me what it is, am I your lover or your friend?
Tell me would you ride for me 'til the very end?
You ain't gotta tell nobody, I'm your lover, I'm your friend
I'ma pull off in the Rari, we gon' leave off in the Benz
Just tell me what it is, if you my lover or my friend, oh no no

[Outro]
If you my lover and my friend
We gon' leave off in the Benz, yeah yeah
You my lover, you my friend
