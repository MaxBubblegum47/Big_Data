[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Enemy fire

[Verse 1]
Who's a friend? Who's an enemy?
Cause sometimes they look the same to me
But looks can be pleasing, yet so deceiving
Sweet words from a serpent's tongue
It's like playing with a loaded gun
Who knows what truth is?
How do you prove it?
I swear I see you watching me, well

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, oh, you can be my soldier
Oh, oh, oh, keeping me safe from all who conspire
Enemy fire
Oh, oh, oh I'm looking for some shelter
Oh, oh, oh, from the Helter Skelter
Oh, oh, oh, just keep me away from all who conspire
Enemy fire
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Enemy fire, enemy fire

[Verse 2]
Burn a hole through the plastic crowd
Because I've been trying to find the way out
It's so confusing but never amusing
Sweet smiles in the aftermath
Turn to whispering behind my back
I need an ally to guard the night time
Someone to keep me from these crazies

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, oh, you can be my soldier
Oh, oh, oh, keeping me safe from all who conspire
Enemy fire
Oh, oh, oh I'm looking for some shelter
Oh, oh, oh, from the Helter Skelter
Oh, oh, oh, just keep me away from all who conspire
Enemy fire
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Enemy fire, enemy fire

[Bridge]
All around me I hear cries
And bombs are falling from the skies
Can't you help me save my life?

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, oh, you can be my soldier
Oh, oh, oh, keeping me safe from all who conspire
Enemy fire
Oh, oh, oh I'm looking for some shelter
Oh, oh, oh, from the Helter Skelter
Oh, oh, oh, just keep me away from all who conspire
Enemy fire
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Enemy fire, enemy fire
