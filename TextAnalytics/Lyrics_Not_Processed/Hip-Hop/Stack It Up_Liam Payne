[Verse 1: Liam Payne]
I don't wanna be broke when I D-I-E
Wanna be livin' it up in VIP
Tryna get in the club, they wanna see ID
Want me to wear nice shoes and a T-I-E

[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne]
I've been workin' and gettin' by
But that ain't enough to satisfy
'Cause I got dreams for you and I
So I got money on my mind

[Chorus: Liam Payne]
So if you wanna stack it up, man, you gotta work for it
I-I-I-I-I-I
Ain't nobody gonna be doin' it for ya
I-I-I-I-I
I got dreams and I got time
But that ain't enough to get me by
So I stack it up, man, I gotta work for it
Yeah, I got money on my mind
I-I, I-I
I got money on my mind
I-I, I-I

[Verse 2: Liam Payne]
I wanna flex hard like D-O-E
But right now my car need the MOT
And I can't give the valet no T-I-P
But like him, I got dreams and they're B-I-G

[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne]
Tried to be a better guy
But that weren't enough to satisfy
I got dreams for you and I
I got money on my mind

[Chorus: Liam Payne]
So if you wanna stack it up, man, you gotta work for it
I-I-I-I-I-I
Ain't nobody gonna be doin' it for ya
I-I-I-I-I
I got dreams and I got time
But that ain't enough to get me by
So I stack it up, man, I gotta work for it
Yeah, I got money on my mind
I-I, I-I
I got money on my mind
I-I, I-I

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
Yeah, I know shit don't come free, you gotta work for it (Gotta work for it)
Lamborghini Urus, bought it when I first saw it (Skrrt, when I first saw it)
She caught me creepin', I had to buy her a purse for it (Purse for it)
I think if I ain't have money, I'd be the worst for her
And if I ain't have money, I woulda been lost her
The loudest ones was the brokest, I was a shit-talker
The loudest ones was the brokest and I was strugglin' (Uh)
Girls called me friend, now they on me, that money comin' in (That money comin' in)
Saint Laurent fiend, I put it in Louis luggages
 (Yeah, yeah)
Took her to Celine, bought her a couple luggages
Wasn't always sweet, Capri Suns for fifty cents (Yeah)
Now I just hate to reminisce (To reminisce)

[Chorus: Liam Payne]
So if you wanna stack it up, man, you gotta work for it
I-I-I-I-I-I
Ain't nobody gonna be doin' it for ya
I-I-I-I-I
I got dreams and I got time
But that ain't enough to get me by
So I stack it up, man, I gotta work for it
Yeah, I got money on my mind
I-I, I-I
I got money on my mind
I-I, I-I
I got money on my mind
