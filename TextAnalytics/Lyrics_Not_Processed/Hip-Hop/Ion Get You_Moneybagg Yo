[Intro]
I don't get you
Dah-dah-dah, dah-dah
I don't get you

[Chorus]
Lift me up and hold me down more (ayy, just hold me down)
If love ain't here then what you 'round for? (fuck you 'round for?)
Believin' lies got you stressin' (why you stressin', man stop stressin')
But that's your friend just bein' messy (that was NiNi and Tanisha)
And it's like we fuckin' through these texts 'cause you send emojis
And I send 'em back (what kind?)
She send a purple pickle (ugh), I send that wet wet back (wet)
One minute you straight then wanna be official
You act so bipolar, I don't get you

[Verse 1]
I told you stay down 'cause I know shit can get a lil' hectic
Ain't been 'round you, got you feelin' like you bein' neglected
You swear that these hoes come before you and I put you second went through my phone and hurt your feelings, hope you learned your lesson (nah)
You say you straight but when you leave you textin' 'bout the dick
I come fuck on you, we make up, then you back with the shit
Don't want to fight, I ice your wrist
When you get mad I buy you shit
Gotta first change your attitude
When I'm on road you sending nudes (pics)
Girl you get wetter than agua (water)
I'm goin' deep in the pool (splash)
I got her screaming like opera (high note)
Problem child act a fool (bad)
She abide by my rules (rules)
Got her stiff on them dudes (stiff)
I just hate when you on social media like you got somethin' to prove
Just do this

[Chorus]
Lift me up and hold me down more (ayy just hold me down)
If love ain't here then what you 'round for? (fuck you 'round for?)
Believin' lies got you stressin' (why you stressin', man stop stressin')
But that's your friend just bein' messy (that was NiNi and Tanisha)
And it's like we fuckin' through these texts 'cause you send emojis
And I send 'em back (what kind?)
She send a purple pickle (ugh), I send that wet wet back (wet)
One minute you straight then wanna be official
You act so bipolar, I don't get you

[Verse 2]
I don't get you, I don't get you, you so hard to figure out
Don't know what I'm gon' do with you, I just need you to hold me down
If I step up out the picture tell me what you gon' do now
I'm so sick of your shit, fuck it, I can do without
You said that you loved me, name the amount
I bring in a bag and you helped me count
You showed me your ex, I called him a clown
Tell him chill out 'cause he can get down
Tell your friends stop comin' at you
Tellin' you shit about your nigga
Different hoes, different shows
You gotta accept that I'm gettin' bigger
I just need you

[Chorus]
Lift me up and hold me down more (ayy just hold me down)
If love ain't here then what you 'round for? (fuck you 'round for?)
Believin' lies got you stressin' (why you stressin', man stop stressin')
But that's your friend just bein' messy (that was NiNi and Tanisha)
And it's like we fuckin' through these texts 'cause you send emojis
And I send 'em back (what kind?)
She send a purple pickle (ugh), I send that wet wet back (wet)
One minute you straight then wanna be official
You act so bipolar, I don't get you
