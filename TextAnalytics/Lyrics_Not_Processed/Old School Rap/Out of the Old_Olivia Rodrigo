[Verse 1]
Feels like I'm not where
I'm supposed to be
I don't fit in with these familiar faces
And the games they play
Don't mean a thing to me
I know there's so much more

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't stop dreaming, and thinking
Maybe I could be someone different
More than a yearbook memory
If I leave this, I'm risking
Almost everything
Am I on the right road

[Chorus]
Outta the old
I've gotta find my way
Into the new
Give anything it takes
I wanna know
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams
Feel like home
If I go out of the old
And into the new
Out of the old
And into the new
Yeah, I wanna know
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams
Feel like home
Out of the old

[Verse 2]
I wish these streets
Were still enough for me
I wish this town
Could give me everything
But I still feel stopped
While every light turns green
Why can't I let it go?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't stop dreaming, and thinking
Maybe I could be someone different
More than a yearbook memory
Leaving all this, I'm risking
Almost everything
But there's only one road

[Chorus]
Outta the old
I've gotta find my way
Into the new
Give anything it takes
I wanna know
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams
Feel like home
If I go out of the old
And into the new
Out of the old
And into the new
Yeah, I wanna know
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams
Feel like home
Out of the old

[Outro]
And into the new
Take me out of the old
And into the new
'Cause I wanna go
I wanna go
Just take me
