[Intro: Tinashe]
Uhh, mmm
Nick J
Tinashe
It's the remix

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
I don't like the way he's looking at you
I'm starting to think you want him too
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can't help it

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & 
Tinashe
]
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why) I still get jealous
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants your sex
That’s why 
(That’s why)
 I still get jealous

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Listen
I'm the type to never sweat no chick
Ain't nobody but you got me stressing this way and you know
Yeah, yeah
Now the struggle's always real
Girls be stepping in my space, all up in your face
How am I supposed to feel?

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It’s not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus: Nick Jonas 
with Tinashe
]
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why) I still get jealous
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants your sex
That’s why
 (That’s why) I still get jealous

[Bridge: Nick Jonas 
with Tinashe
]
You're the only one invited (Invited)
Say there's no one 
else for you
 (For you)
'Cause you know I get excited 
(Yeah)
When you get jealous too

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas 
with Tinashe
]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm turning red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It’s not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus: Nick Jonas 
with Tinashe
]
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That’s why
 (That’s why) I still get jealous (I get jealous)
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants your sex
That’s why (That’s why) I still get jealous

[Outro: Nick Jonas & 
Tinashe
]
Ohh
 (Oh, that's why)
​(That's why)
 I still get jealous
Jealous, baby, jealous, baby, baby
​Oh, that's why
Nick J, Tinashe
I still get jealous (Jealous, jealous, jealous)
