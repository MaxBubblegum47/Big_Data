[Intro: Camila]
That's my girl

[Verse 1: Ally 
+ Camila
]
Yeah, who's been working so damn hard?
You got that head on 
overload?
Got yourself this flawless body
Aching now from 
head to toe

[Refrain: Normani & 
Ally
 & (Dinah)]
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
All my ladies 'round the world
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
(Good girls better get bad)

[Pre-Chorus: Lauren + Camila]
You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go

[Chorus: Normani & 
Lauren
]
Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder, then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high
That's my girl

[Post-Chorus: All & 
Camila
 & 
Lauren

That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
Get up, what you waiting for?
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
Oh

Nod if you been played by every boo
Just tryna show you off
Thought he was the best you ever had
Until he 
cut you off

[Refrain: Normani & 
Ally
 & (Dinah)]
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Bet you bet you know your worth
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
(Good girls better get bad)

You've been down before
You've been hurt before
