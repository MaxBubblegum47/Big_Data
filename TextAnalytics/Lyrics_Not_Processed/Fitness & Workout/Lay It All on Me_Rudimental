[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
All alone as you look through the door
Nothing left to see
If it hurts and you can't take no more
Lay it all on me

[Pre-Chorus: Rudimental & Ed Sheeran]
No, you don't have to keep it under lock and key
'Cause I will never let you down
And if you can't escape all your uncertainties
Baby I can show you how

[Chorus: Rudimental & Ed Sheeran]
Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
You can lay it all on me
Yeah you can lay it all on me (Lay it all on me)
You can lay it all on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
If you're scared when you're out on your own
Just remember me
'Cause I wonâ€™t let you go it alone
Lay it all on me

[Pre-Chorus: Rudimental & Ed Sheeran]
No, you don't have to keep it under lock and key
'Cause I will never let you down
And if you can't escape all your uncertainties
Baby I can show you how

[Chorus: Rudimental & Ed Sheeran]
Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
You can lay it all on me
Yeah, you can lay it all on me
(Lay it all, lay it all on me)
Lay it all on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
So if you're hurting babe
Let your heart be free
You got a friend in me
I'll be your shoulder at anytime you need
Baby I believe
So if you're hurting
Just let your heart be free
Lay it all on me
I'll be your shoulder anytime you need
Lay it all on me
Lay it all on me

[Outro]
Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me you can
Lay it all, lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Lay it all, lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me you can
I'll be your shoulder when anytime you need
Lay it all on me
Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me you can
Lay it all, lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Let me in babe let me in baby
Lay it all on me
