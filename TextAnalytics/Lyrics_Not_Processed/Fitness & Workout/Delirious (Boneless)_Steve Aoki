[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
H-Hold up, you got me woke up
The way you roll that
Sticky like okra
Just let me coach ya
Show you about my culture
It's a late night show like Conan
Bitch, the party ain't over!
Go ham in here, and grab your friend by the hand
Let me know, is you down?
Body like Playmate of the Year
I might make the play of the year
Already know that we don't play fair
But I think that you and your girl
Should put me some of that! (We stand!)

[Hook: Steve Aoki Ft. Chris Lake, Kid Ink & Tujamo]
Out 'til the sun up
Twisted and burnt up
Can't nobody stop us
We're goin' delirious
Out 'til the sun up
Twisted and burnt up
Can't nobody stop us
We're goin' delirious
La la la la la
La la la la la
Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that

We're goin' delirious!
La la la la la

Come and take a ride, babe
Up all night, who cares?

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
We on sunset until the sun up
I got my goons here (Wait!)
So don't you run up
It could get ugly
Think I need a wing man
I'm straight from California, smelling like a weed man
La la la la la
I got a lot of, so go and take that hit dip drip
One sip from the fifth
I ain't seen nothing, girl, plead the fifth
Make your man cease to exist
All this money don't make no sense, you scared!
Gimme some of that!

[Hook: Steve Aoki Ft. Chris Lake, Kid Ink & Tujamo]
