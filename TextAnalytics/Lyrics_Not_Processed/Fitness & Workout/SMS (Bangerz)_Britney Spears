[Prod. by Mike WiLL Made It]

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
Bangerz... fuckin' bangerz
Bangerz... fuck-fuck-fuckin' bangerz!

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
All the way in the back with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me, "What you doing with that?"
Yeah, yeah
You say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me
One day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sittin' 'round here waiting for a man to tell me where the fuck my seat be at
Where Mike WiLL at?

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Fuckin' bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Fuckin' bangerz)

[Verse 2: Britney Spears & 
(Miley Cyrus)
]
I'm flying high up on the bird; acrophobiac
I slick, caught her eyeing down my purse
Where the dollars at?
I let her know the rent's due on the first
They can call the hearse
'Cause, if there's any violation, I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with a big dog
(Why I need his millis when I got Billy on my speed dial?)
You know I'm on that "meow"
, quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Fuckin' bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff
 (Fuckin' bangerz)

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
The plane, boss, the plane
â€˜Bout to get that big rock
Sit that on my hand
Make that media big talk
The plane, boss, the plane
Psych, that must be the purple
Got up in my brain
Had me a little bit dismal

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
I, I, I
Bangerz
I, I, I
Fucking bangerz
I, I, I
Bangerz
I, I, I
Fucking bangerz
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I
