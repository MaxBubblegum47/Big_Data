[Verse 1]
Oh my god, what's happening? Thought I was fine
I told you I don't need your love like three, four thousand times
But that's a lie, no, I can't look you in the eye
Oh, I, oh, I
So I did everything to push you all away
And finally you left and now I'm missing you like crazy
And I cry, no, I can't sleep alone at night
Oh, I, oh, I

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
Look what you've done to me
I got everything I wanted
But you're everything, you're everything I want
Look what you've done to me
Didn't know I was alone
'Til I was running to your, running to your heart
Like magnets
Oh my god, what's happening?
Look what you've done
Look what you've done to me
I got everything I wanted
But you're everything, you're everything I need

[Verse 2]
I wanna tell you things and show you all the rest
Broadcast my emotions on the radio and take 'em off my chest
I hope you're listening
Are you? Are you?
And I been spinning 'round in circles, spinning 'round in circles
Writing in my journal 'bout you
Wonder if it's over, I ain't getting closer
Think it's time I told you the truth
(Hey, wait a minute, ugh)

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
Look what you've done to me
I got everything I wanted
But you're everything, you're everything I want
Look what you've done to me
Didn't know I was alone
'Til I was running to your, running to your heart
Like magnets
Oh my god, what's happening?
Look what you've done
Look what you've done to me
I got everything I wanted
But you're everything, you're everything I need

[Bridge]
Ah, what have you done to me?
Something about your face
I don't know whether to kiss it or punch it
If you don't get away from me right now
I swear to God, I swear, ah! (Ah)

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
Look what you've done to me
I got everything I wanted
But you're everything, you're everything I want
Look what you've done to me
Didn't know I was alone
'Til I was running to your, running to your heart
Like magnets
Oh my god, what's happening? (Ooh)
Look what you've done
Look what you've done to me
I got everything I wanted
But you're everything, you're everything I need
