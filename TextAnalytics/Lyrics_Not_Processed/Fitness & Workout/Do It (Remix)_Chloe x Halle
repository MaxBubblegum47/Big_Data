[Intro: Doja Cat, 
Chloe
, 
Yung Miami
 & Mulatto]
What's that sound like to you? (
Oh
)
I don't know, man
This one sounds like a remix (
Oh, oh
)
City,
 Big Latto (
Oh
)
Period

[Verse 1: Doja Cat & 
Chloe
]
Yeah, said I'm not kissing nobody, boy, I got my lip gloss on
Shut up (Hush), why you talkin' when you know that this my song?
This ain't really the night to blow me up, I ditched my phone
Five shots, ready to party, throwin' it back, it's principle
Throwin' it back like fishing pole, throwin' it back like fishing pole
All of your junk like physical
That's just how we do it, not a rhyme or a reason
We signin' broads in the front while you look off in the bleachers
We pullin' up the way we do to keep the audience tweetin'
The farther we goin' up, it's like the harder they rеachin'
If you see my titties, I tell 'em rеcord it and keep it
A couple twins sittin' pretty, no Victoria Secret (
Yeah,
 c'mon)

[Verse 2: Chloe]
I beat my face
Movin' fast 'cause the Uber on the way
Takin' pictures, make sure you can't see no lace
That wig secure like the money in a safe
I look like bae
Now I'm on the way
Let you know when I'm 'bout a mile away
When I'm outside, please don't make me wait
The party startin' when we pull up to the gate
Girl, we so late

[Pre-Chorus: Halle & 
Doja Cat
]
I'm just with the crew
We ain't out here looking for boo (
No, we not
)
'Cause some nights be better with you (
Yeah, come on, okay
)
It's a homies-only kind of mood
And tonight, we on a hundred (
What's up?
)
One hundred (
Uh-huh
)
No drama, no baby mamas, keepin' it cute (
Come on
)

[Chorus: Chloe]
Ooh, ooh
That's just what I do, do, do
And that's just how we do it, do it, do it
And you could do it too, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: Yung Miami]
I pull up foreign (Skrrt), with my friends
AMG (Yep), on a Benz
Ride or die (Ride or die), 'til the end ('Til the end)
I be cute, how we look settin' trends (Period)
These my queens, these my girls (Girls)
I don't do pretend (No)
Ice check, wrist check, Patek on ten (Ice)
Big rocks, big bags, waist be looking slim (Ow)
She keep looking at us but I know she can't swim (City)

[Verse 4: JT]
We out tonight probably
City Girls, Chloe, Halle
Niggas on our body (We got that)
Number-one box like Roddy
We just here to party (Yeah)
Taste test, these niggas salty
Text that nigga probably, but he never see my body (At all)
This is what I do (I do)
I'm with my crew (My crew)
Don't call me, call Tyrone, Erykah Badu
Lace on like I'm from an island
No, I'm not foreign, I drive 'em
Skrrt, skrrt, all my bitches stay ridin'
Stewardess, my relationship private (Period)

[Chorus: Chloe]
Ooh, ooh
That's just what I do, do, do
And that's just how we do it
Yeah, that's just how we do it
Yeah, you could do it too, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 5: Mulatto]
Do it now, lookin' good
Make him spend it like he should
Rolling 'Woods, bustin' juggs
Love them niggas from the hood (Yeah)
Nothin' about me basic
And my body stacked like my savings
Rappin' 'bout that pussy power got the whole game intimidated (Hah)
Yeah, I make him do it, do it
Nails on fleek, get into it
Money talk, yeah, I speak fluent
So the bag what I'm pursuin'
Toes white, lace right
I look too pretty to fight
And it's tight, I'm his type
They say lil' baby a bite
Thirty-inch bundles with the bayang (Bayang)
Latto got the block hot just like Lil Wayne
Classy like Chloe and Halle, nasty like Megan
Losing me, you drop the queen like blackjack in Vegas (Latto)

[Chorus: Chloe & 
Doja Cat
]
Ooh, ooh
That's just what I do, do, do (
You like it, you like it, don't you?
)
And that's just how we do it, do it, do it (
You like it, you like it, don't you?
)
And you could do it too, ooh, ooh, ooh (
You can do it too
)

[Bridge: Halle]
Oh, oh, oh, I been looking for tonight
Girl, lookin' fly, we so high
Got diamonds all over, we shine
Yeah, you know we like the touchin' and the lovin'
And we don't need no husband in the function
So I keep it comin', yeah, you know I be ready
So give me the lovin', oh

[Verse 6: Chloe]
Drop that ass to the floor (To the floor)
Here's to the pretty young thing with the big ol' goals
We don't gotta act nice, we don't gotta act right
We never causing no fights, but I'll still give you the smoke
Yeah, I smile, you caught my eye, eye
But, boy, I ain't worried 'bout you tonight
We goin' on and on, they keep on playin' this song
And we gon' do it, do it, do it 'til the early morn
