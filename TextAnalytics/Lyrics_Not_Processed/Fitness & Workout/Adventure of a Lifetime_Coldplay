[Intro]
[Indecipherable]

[Verse 1]
Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends, every day
That's what she told him

[Verse 2]
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

[Chorus]
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Post-Chorus]
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Verse 2]
Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

[Chorus]
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Post-Chorus]
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Bridge]
Turn your magic on, Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape
(Woo, woo)

[Refrain]
If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh then I
And if we've only got this life
You'll get me through
And if we've only got this life
In this adventure, oh then I
Want to share it with you
With you, with you
Yeah, I do

[Outro]
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
