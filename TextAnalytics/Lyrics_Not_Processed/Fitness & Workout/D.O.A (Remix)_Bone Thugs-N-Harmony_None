[Layzie Bone]
Na, Na, Na, Na… Hey, Hey, Hey… Good Bye!

[Krayzie Bone]
Whooo! C’mon, Bone Thug, We gon’ do it like this, yeah… Kray Jackson…

Remember the killa, the lyrical beast? I’m gon’ murda ya!
Up in you like a hernia
You suck, I’m just confirmin’ ya, nigga!
If you did it, nigga, then clearly we talkin’ about you!
Get off the bandwagon
Nigga, quit swingin’ on dicks and get your brand accurate
Kray Jack the man, ask ‘em!
Don’t need a hand
Rappin’ insane with the same average, always above!
Nigga, never no love
You niggas is artificial, insufficient, not an issue
Our position is monumental, all your shit was accidental!
Simple, don’t be no fool!
Don’t be consumed in auto-tune. (Auto-tune!)
‘Cause it’s a deadly storm blowin’ through here soon
Originators can survive it if they stay true and innovate
Imitators, fakers, they all die

[Flesh-n-Bone]
Y’all simply can’t all rap and it ain’t no time to play
Twenty-four hours a day, that’s seven straight!
My killers be rallied up, the scrilla – they tally up
Like Bally’s – I exercise you
Like Dahmer – I victimize you
Criticize you for using auto-tune
Recognize here comes your doom
There’s no room for the wack. They be givin’ a black eye to the game
But there’s more than a thousand ways to get ‘em and leave the lames strangled
Flesh banged on ‘em and I never did let up
Fandango you hoes!
Opponents they keep their back on the ropes, their faces hit the floor
Suckers ain’t nothin’ but jokes with their vocals made artificially
I’d rather buck ‘em y’all exposed, now they gotta get disposed
My temp is still burning hot, while these phony’s, they hardly not!
We can lock on up and then see how hard of a hit you got!

[Layzie Bone]
Na, Na, Na, Na… Hey, Hey, Hey… Good Bye!… Bye Bye!… Bye Bye!
Why they want to sound like, dress like, act like? (Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone)
Why they want to look like, dress like, sound like?
(It’s the Thuggish Ruggish!) It’s the critical, criminal, non-subliminal
Set it off, let it off, lines is visible
I battle, I challenge, I rhyme my syllables
Sound like Bone, that’s dispicable
I’ll put you in I.C.U. I see you is not original
It’s pitiful, niggas ain’t lyrical
Give me that deal, give me that miracle!
They lackin’ the talent, they lackin’ the balance, they lackin’ the harmony
These niggas pretenders, no contenders, it ain’t hard to see
No authenticity, they won’t make history
They only makin’ Lil Lay-Lay mad, they going out like they J.J. Fad
Now how do these stars assume they can use the auto-tune
Just because the bass go boom I spend my dollars, consume?
But naw, I bring these lames to their doom
Better wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
We bringin’ back innovation
We havin’ a celebration, cause Flesh-n-Bone is home
Been ten years strong, that’s domination
Never need no nomination ‘cause homie the streets respect it
We keepin’ it epic and never neglect it we get it in on a record
I’m talkin’ about keepin’ it classic, they talkin’ about keepin’ it plastic
They puttin’ the game in a casket. We gonna live on like the Jacksons
I’m sorry I’m endin’ your cycle, I gotta do this for Michael
You heard from Jay-Z, but nigga this Layzie, it’s somethin’ I’m willin’ to die for

Yeah… Come on! Come On! Come On!
Na, Na, Na, Na… Hey, Hey, Hey… Good Bye!

[Wish Bone]
Come here nigga, you know what?…

First off let me take it back to High School
You niggas teach rules, being in a rented crib
To this day I don’t wear Jordan’s
Wasn’t the first nigga with them in High School
End of blunt ass nigga, put that out (Put that out!)
Shine in everybody’s category
Cut that out, (Cut that out!) Flat out! (Flat out!)
It’s a damn shame, for spare change, what come out these fraudelent rappers’ mouth
Or should I say entertainers, I’m complainin’
North, East, West, and South, cut that out
‘Til ‘em all Pac and no slouch. (Get it! Get it! Get it!)
If you can’t sing, then don’t sing!
The realest knew they place and they did it
We blaze auto-tune so you need to sense this (Bone! Bone! Bone!)
Rest and silent hood living. (lifted?)
They feel me resonate it. Get Bible realest
Quiet me, (Naw!) I’mma stay hood, harmonied out

[Bizzy Bone]
Invisible cut the Crucifix, explodes into the galaxy!
Show you niggas how loose I get – No! No fatalities!
Zeus, I’m comin’ to juice the mix. Operation: Totality
Opium flow wherever I go, auto-tune to the Matrixes
Shot myself in Cali, woke up without no witnesses
Satan, think she my mistresses
Mohammad, where my bitches is?
Eve’s wicked as witches is
Yeah! Nigga this peanuts!
I’m T-Pain, back with my Nazarinians and we nuts!
These Palestinians with 3 buck shots!
When Roger Troutman caught his brother back from Hades like Cain – took him out!
Generals say “Get out man.”
Give me my third eye and I’ll pitch it back to the masters
Like the back of the dollar, but why?
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

[Layzie Bone]
Na, Na, Na, Na… Hey, Hey, Hey… Good Bye!
