Thinking out of line just to make the sun shine anyway
I can be like you
Fighting with the truth, trying to hide a fool in a fantasy
Oh, I'm dreaming
Lay me down, lay me down, take me now

Our lady
Our lady
Our lady of the skies

Hiding in the sun like a loaded gun, reality
Aiming high at my dream
But I can get along, she makes me strong, anyway
Oh, I'm dreaming
And there is no other way

Our lady
Our lady
Our lady of the skies

Flying in the sky with a bunch of high fidelity
I can hear your song
Offer me a ring just to show me your sincerity
Oh, I'm dreaming
Let me go, let me go

Our lady
Our lady
Our lady of the skies
