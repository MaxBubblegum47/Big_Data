[Verse 1]
Ain't never felt this way
Can't get enough so stay with me
It's not like we got big plans (oohh)
Let's drive around town holding hands

[Pre-Chorus]
And you need to know
You're the only one alright, alright
And you need to know
That you keep me up all night, all night (yeah)

[Chorus]
Oh, my heart hurts so good
I love you, baby, so bad, so bad
Oh, oh my heart hurts so good
I love you, baby, so bad, so bad

[Verse 2]
Mad cool in all my clothes
Mad warm when you get close...to me
Slow dance these summer nights
Our disco ball's my kitchen light

[Pre-Chorus]
And you need to know
That nobody could take your place, your place
And you need to know
That I'm hella obsessed with your face, your face (yeah)

[Chorus]
Oh, my heart hurts so good
I love you, baby, so bad, so bad
Oh, oh my heart hurts so good
I love you, baby, so bad, so bad (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
And you need to know
You're the only one, alright, alright
And you need to know
That you keep me up all night, all night

[Chorus]
My heart hurts so good
I love you, baby, so bad, so bad
Oh, oh my heart hurts so good
I love you, baby, so bad, so bad...oh
So bad, oh
Oh, my heart hurts...
Oh, my heart hurts...
Oh, my heart hurts...
So bad.... Oh
