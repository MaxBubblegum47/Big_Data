[Verse 1]
Take a trip into my garden
I've got so much to show ya
The fountains and the waters
Are begging just to know ya

[Refrain]
And it's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby

[Verse 2]
I guess it's something like a fun fair
Put gas into the motor
And boy I'll meet you right there
We'll ride the rollercoaster

[Refrain]
'Cause it's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you to
Tell me right before it goes down
Promise me you'll
Hold my hand if I get scared now
Might tell you to
Take a second, baby, slow it down
You should know I, you should know I

[Chorus]
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
Come on, baby, play me like a love song
Every time it comes on
I get this sweet desire
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you

[Verse 3]
Now it's the perfect season
Yeah, let's go for it this time
We're dancing with the trees and
I've waited my whole life

[Refrain]
It's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you to
Tell me right before it goes down
Promise me you'll
Hold my hand if I get scared now
Might tell you to
Take a second, baby, slow it down
You should know I, you should know I

[Chorus]
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
Come on, baby, play me like a love song
Every time it comes on
I get this sweet desire
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you

[Bridge]
Just for you
I bloom just for you
I bloom just for you
Baby, baby, I've been saving this for you, baby
Baby, baby, I've been saving this for you, baby

[Chorus]
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
Come on, baby, play me like a love song
Every time it comes on
I get this sweet desire
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you

[Outro]
Just for you
I bloom just for you
I bloom just for you
Just for you
I bloom just for you
I bloom just for you
