[Verse 1: Avril Lavigne]
Been seeing too much of you lately
And you're starting to get on my nerves
This is exactly what happened last time
And it's not what we deserve
It's a waste of my time lately
And I'm running out of words

[Pre-Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
If it's really meant to be
Then you can find a way to see

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
That maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby, 'cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love

[Verse 2: Avril Lavigne]
It's really great to be with you
This is how I could spend my life
But I'm capable of taking care of myself
So if you fuck this up, then go take a hike
It's a waste of my time shaking
I'm not going out to search

[Pre-Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
If it's really meant to be
Then you can find a way to see

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
Maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby, 'cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love

[Bridge: Evan Taubenfeld 
with Avril Lavigne
]
You and me
We can both start over
Just the two of us
We can get a little closer
So follow me
Honestly
And you will see...yeah

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
Maybe you should just shut up (Shut up)
Even when it gets tough
Baby, 'cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love
Maybe you should just shut up (Shut up)
Even when it gets tough
Baby, 'cause this is love (This is love)
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love
