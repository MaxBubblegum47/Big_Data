[Interlude: Kevin Abstract]
"Yo, yo, yo, this is Kevin Cinema. You're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bow! When I remember my first experience with a pool, you know? It was in Corpus Christi, I was visiting my sister. I'm telling you, I swear to God, It was either 1999 or 2000—1999, the only year that I remember... Seriously, I mean it. So, I'm standing, like, towards the edge of the pool. There's a bunch of people there, like my, my sister, my brother, I think my mom. It's a pool on this apartment complex in Corpus. I'm just looking at the water, like, I'm telling myself, like, "Jump in, I'll figure it out. I, I know I can swim..." So, as soon as I jump in, I panic and I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just [inhales deeply], it sounds like this [frantic water splashing] and I can hear people, I can hear people screaming outside. Like it just sounds muffled. They're like "Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh my god!" and I'm just going crazy underwater. Oh, my God, I'm probably about to die—Looking back, this is how I feel. Who knows what my young brain was actually thinking and, like, processing in that moment? Next thing I know, my brother comes into the pool [diving, splash noise] grabs me, pulls me out [chokingly exhales] and like I was scared of the water ever since then, I will never ever get back into the water. But then I learned how to swim. It was great. This is Kevin Cinema and that's one of my earliest memories with water."
