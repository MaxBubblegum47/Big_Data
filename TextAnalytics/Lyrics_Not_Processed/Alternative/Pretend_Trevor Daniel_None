[Chorus]
You said that you hate me
You don't wanna date me
You don't really love me
No more
And girl it's driving me crazy
But damn as of lately
I'm just pretending
That I don't give a fuck no more
'Til I don't give a fuck no more

[Verse]
Why you acting crazy?
Why you acting jealous?
You say you have another guy
Who would treat you better
Say I don't treat you right
But you got me messed up
Posting all on 
the gram
 acting like you lovers
Damn babe
You act like I'm supposed to like this shit
Like I should've known where your mind was at
But you always flip
When I'm with another chick
And act like it was this
Nah, we ain't cool, babe
Head up rocking North Face
Iâ€™ma flex on you babe
Screaming "fuck love" all day
You wanted this, you wanted this, right?
Oh, you wanted this, you wanted this, right?
Oh, you wanted this, you wanted this, right?
Oh, you wanted this, you wanted this, right?

[Chorus]
You said that you hate me
You don't wanna date me
You don't really love me
No more
And girl it's driving me crazy
But damn as of lately
I'm just pretending
That I don't give a fuck no more
'Til I don't give a fuck no more
You said that you hate me
You don't wanna date me
You don't really love me
No more
And girl it's driving me crazy
But damn as of lately
I'm just pretending
That I don't give a fuck no more
'Til I don't give a fuck no more

[Outro]
I can tell you're missing me, girl
I can tell you're missing me, baby
I can see that look in your eyes
I can tell you're wishing you never let me go
Never let me go, Never let me go
Never let me go, Never let me go
Never let me go, Never let me go
Never let me go, Never let me go
We ain't cool babe
No, nah, nah
I'ma flex on you babe
No, nah, nah
You're just missing me babe
No, nah, nah
