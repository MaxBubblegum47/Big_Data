[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
They split my world into pieces, I ain't heard from my nieces
I been feeling defeated, like I'm the worst in the boyband
I ain't sleep in some weekends, tryna headline both weekends
Lead my niggas, y'all sheepin', I keep the world in my hands
I know accounts should be deleted
I know some niggas should stop hitting my phone
Whenever they needing money or favors done
'Cause I'm still worried 'bout when Ashlan finna put the razor down
So I don't really give a fuck about what story they done spun
And I ain't done (No, no)
Yeah (Tell something)
And I ain't done, you heard me?
I ain't done (Yeah, I'm screaming oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I really miss the old days before the cosigns
I really miss them cold days before the road signs
I really miss when I ain't know which way I was supposed to head
And I was pressed because my shawty gave me cold signs
I was writing poems 'bout her dawg in study hall
And she was mad 'cause I never wanna show her off (Scared)
And every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft
I thought I had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow screaming

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I don't wanna waste no more time
I'm ready to go
I put my life on standby
I can leave you alone

[Scratches: Kevin Abstract]

[Verse 2: Joba]
'Cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
Life is a dish served cold most times
And all my life I've taken handfuls
Force-fed by the hand that feeds us
But not all hands created equal
I stand by, waiting for something good to come
In due time, the skies will split for the sun to smile

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
My mother called me today
She said she thought she felt my energy a country away
I apologized for not calling enough due to weight
But couldn't tell you if I kept it in my head to decay
I asked her "Why this world love echoing hate?"
She said "Don't let those who don't know you start dictating your fate"
I think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks
Conditioned to omit them until our foundation will shake
It's no debate
The road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
And recognize the wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
Don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you're a jewel
This world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
Sometimes you gotta step away and check your own intentions
And analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
If people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
You never needed them if they make you another villain

[Interlude: Joba, Sammy Jo & Tune Up]
Pressure
"They tried to take the bike. And they took my friend's bike and then my friend was gonna get it back but then he didn't get it back and then we had to go to the police station. And then, um, then some  (Pressure) random stranger brought back his bike. We just, you know, and we didn't tell our mums so we got in trouble (Pressure makes me—) because they found out like a day later."
Do you want to start the game again?

[Bridge: Joba]
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Take it all or leave it
Pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu—
Wish I could, wish I could, wish I—
I can't take, I can't take, I can't—
Makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me—
Pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu—
Wish I could, wish I could, wish I—
I can't take, I can't take, I can't—
Makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me—

[Outro: Joba]
Sipping on my pain, smoking by my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Sipping on my pain, smoking by my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Take it all or leave it
Sipping on my (Sipping on my), smoking by my (Smoking by my)
Ingesting my (ingesting my), I just wanna (I just wanna)
Sipping on my (Sipping on my), smoking on my (Smoking by my)
Ingesting my (ingesting my), I just wanna (I just wanna)
