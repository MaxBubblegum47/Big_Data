[Verse 1]
Could I trust you with my thoughts
Or would you use them all against me
Can you replace my eyes for yours
And see what I really look like
I could help you criticize

[Chorus 1]
Looking for a sense of relation
Where do people want me to be?
I can't help but cry on vacation
Dressed to un-impress easily
Losing sight again
I'll go ahead and give your eyes back now

[Verse 2]
You grow up, gone
So what's the point of connecting to anyone?
Is a relationship bought or is it won?

[Chorus 2]
Are the things I think are important
Simply just distractions from death?
All of my ideas turn to content
They can be conceived 'til they're read
Lost my words again
It doesn't matter
'Cause you wouldn't understand

[Chorus 3]
Love in teens and life in the twenties
Nothing much to look forward to
I can't help but cry on vacation
Is this the way to exit my youth?
Oh

[Outro]
Hey, treacherous doctor, do you know what's the matter with me?
Hey, treacherous doctor, do you know what's the matter with me?
