[Chorus]
I'm finna stand tall in it, I'm all in it (Uh-uh)
You be on my back like a cardigan (Cardigan)
Call her again, I'm in love with your friend (Call her again)
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence (Evidence)
It's evident that you ready to ride (Ready to ride)
Hop up in my Jeep and put your pride to the side (Pride to the side)
Go against the gang, you must be ready to hide (Ready to hide)
Swangin' on the corner, bang my tape 'til it pop (Tape 'til it pop)
I thought I was a goner, pledged to your honor
Burn marijuana, these diamonds is on her
Hotter than the sauna, I met her at Salata
Bought lil' baby Prada, she popped it for the dollar

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stick around, you should save yourself (Save yourself)
But you can hit my phone if you need some help (Needed some help)
Don't stick around, you should save yourself (Save yourself)
But you can hit my phone if you need some help (Needed some help)

[Chorus]
I'm finna stand tall in it, I'm all in it (Uh-uh)
You be on my back like a cardigan (Cardigan)
Call her again, I'm in love with your friend (Call her again)
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence (Evidence)
It's evident that you ready to ride (Ready to ride)
Hop up in my Jeep and put your pride to the side (Pride to the side)
Go against the gang, you must be ready to hide (Ready to hide)
Swangin' on the corner, bang my tape 'til it pop (Tape 'til it pop)
I thought I was a goner, pledged to your honor
Burn marijuana, these diamonds is on her
Hotter than the sauna, I met her at Salata
Bought lil' baby Prada, she popped it for the dollar

[Bridge]
Don't stick around, you should save yourself (Save yourself)
But you can hit my phone if you need some help (Needed some help)
Don't stick around, you should save yourself (Save yourself)
But you can hit my phone if you need some help (Needed some help)

[Outro]
I'm finna stand tall— (Tall)

You be on my back like a cardigan (Cardigan)
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence (Evidence)
All— (All)

You be on my back like a cardigan
We be doing dirt, you hide the evidence
