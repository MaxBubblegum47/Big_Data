[Verse 1]
This hurts like hell
But I keep telling myself
It's gonna get better
But it's taking forever
I tried to go out
But every time I leave the house
Something reminds me
Of what's now behind me

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday I let go
Just a little bit more

[Chorus]
In the end I'm gonna be alright
But it might take a hundred sleepless nights
To make the memories of you disappear
But right now I can't see nothing through these tears

[Verse 2]
Control my thoughts
Convincing myself it's your loss
I really mean it
And I'm starting to believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everyday I let go
Just a little bit more

[Chorus]
In the end I'm gonna be alright
But it might take a hundred sleepless nights
To make the memories of you disappear
But right now I can't see nothing through these tears
Out of sight but you're not out of my mind
So it might take somebody else at night
To make it feel like you were never here
But right now I can't see nothing through these tears

[Bridge]
You said it was over
But when we got closer
You cried on my shoulder
Goodbye

[Chorus]
In the end I'm gonna be alright
But it might take a hundred sleepless nights
To make the memories of you disappear
But right now I can't see nothing through these tears
Out of sight but you're not out of my mind
So it might take somebody else at night
To make it feel like you were never here
But right now I can't see nothing through these tears

[Outro]
Driving home on an empty highway
I thought about you and I hit the brakes
What we had and who we were was so clear
But right now I can't see nothing through these tears
