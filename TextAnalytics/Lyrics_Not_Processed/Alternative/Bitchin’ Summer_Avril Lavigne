[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Everyone is waiting on the bell (On the bell)
A couple seconds, we'll be raisin' hell (Raisin' hell)
The sun is shinin' down
School is finally out
Nothin' matters, so we might as well (Might as well)

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's bakin' in the sun
Come and party, do it while we're young
Move your body when you hear the drum
So put your hands up

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast, make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna, gonna be, be a bitchin' summer

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh) Bitchin' summer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh) Bitchin' summer

[Verse 2]
Throwin' empty bottles in the fire (In the fire)
Whiskey's got us singin' like a choir (Like a choir)
We're all gonna run
When the police come
But in the moment we are so alive (So alive)

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's bakin' in the sun
Come and party, do it while we're young
Move your body when you hear the drum
So put your hands up

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna, gonna be, be a bitchin' summer

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh) Bitchin' summer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh) Bitchin' summer

[Bridge]
Right, right, right near the beach, the party don't stop
If we don't get harassed by the motherfucking cops
Quarter tank of gas, about a half a pack
My cell phone's dyin' but there's no turnin' back
I can feel the breeze, steerin' with my knee
Drummin' on the dashboard, bumpin' to the beat
Hit the windshield wiper searchin' for my lighter
I gotta get right before this all-nighter

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna, gonna be, be a bitchin' summer

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Hey)
(Oh, oh, oh) Bitchin' summer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Hey)
(Oh, oh, oh) Bitchin' summer

[Outro]
Pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna, gonna be, be a bitchin' summer
