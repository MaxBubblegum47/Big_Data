[Verse 1]
If you were to ask my mother, she'd tell you this
When I was a little bit younger, still innocent
She came to my dance recital that I wasn't in
'Cause I spent the whole time starin' at myself in the mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh
I don't know, I don't know
How to get her back, I don't know
Where'd she go? Where'd she go, go?

[Chorus]
Why am I so stupid?
Used to be so smart
When they pulled my teeth out
Lost the wisest part
I used to be so happy
No matter what happened to me
But when they pulled my teeth out
Lost the wisest part

[Verse 2]
And now that I'm a little bit older, a whole nineteen years
Everybody drowns their problems in Xanax and beer
I'm buyin' all the presents on Christmas, but my tree is clear
And now underneath, it's hard for me to look in the mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh
I don't know, I don't know
How to get her back, I don't know
Where’d she go? Where'd she go, go?

[Chorus]
Why am I so stupid?
Used to be so smart
When they pulled my teeth out
Lost the wisest part
I used to be so happy
No matter what happened to me
But when they pulled my teeth out
Lost the wisest part
(
Out, lost the wisest part
)

[Post-Chorus]
Out, lost the wisest part
Out, lost the wisest part
(
Lost the wisest part
)

[Chorus]
Why am I so stupid?
Used to be so smart
When they pulled my teeth out
Lost the wisest part
I used to be so happy
No matter what happened to me
But when they pulled my teeth out
Lost the wisest part
(
Out, lost the wisest part)

[Outro]
Out, lost the wisest part
Out, lost the wisest part
