[Verse 1]
Kells
This is a real rapper's theme music
Bitch, sing to it
This how you cook up some dope with no powder
Don't turn on that stove, just turn this shit up louder
Black Eddie Bauer, mask on my face
Like I'm ready to take what is yours cause it's ours
Y'all stole my style, I shit on you like bowels
And take all your princesses, bitch, I am Bowser
Fuck superpowers, I got this weed
Gun on my hip, dawg, that's all that I need
I don't play games, man I'm not in no league
And I don't drop no names but bitch I am from Cleve-land
D-D-D-Damn, someone tell Britney we did it again
I hear Pooh Gutta acquitted again
And my bank account holding 6 digits again
Pour out some Henn'
This for the ones who ain't make it
This for the ones who ain't make it
Focus your lens, point it at me and see greatness
Point it at me and see greatness
Ray need a Benz, Dub needa all black Mercedes
Tezo need all white, he racist but homie I'm sayin'
I need a penthouse that's vacant
Arab money "Salaam-Alaikum"
The beast is awaken, pick up your shotty
My bitch is a murderer, she got a body
She got that brain, summa cum laude
My city the jungle, don't take that Safari
It's lions, it's tigers, gangsters, disciples
Lords, Judases, shanks and them rifles
Whores who swear that they live by The Bible
And friends who think they deserve more than entitled
And that's why Iâ€¦

[Hook]
(Sail)
Up out of the ghetto
Away from the mornings where snow in that shovel
(Sail)
Up out of this level
I'm tryna be number one, why would I settle?
(Sail)
Gone to the new world
No Pinta, no Nina, no Santa Maria
Still keep it hood with my peers, sippin' Carlos Rossi Sangria

[Verse 2]
Uh, Drank in my cup
Workin' my wrist, I be spankin' my slut
Juggle my nuts
Use your two hands while I juggle these fucks
But thats zero, it's none
My hands busy holding middle fingers up
I don't do two things: that's love and that's trust
And I don't hate y'all, I'm just fuckin' with us
And that's word to Nipsey
My hustle's mean, I can sell bats to Ken Griffey
I'm like Lionel Richie, my fans have me touring till 2050
This cycle is evil
This verse is for Tino
One time for my people
And fuck all these fakers
Can't wait till you back on your feet, the streets need you
