[Verse 1]
I don't want much
I just wanna be a better man
To my baby
Meet me off good luck
I was singing with them Jezebels
Under perfume sheets
Got a golden smile, heart overflow
But got us in love, but it wasn't enough

[Chorus]
What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl

[Verse 2]
All night long I was out
Out 'till the morning
But baby you're tender
Lost when I'm longing
Baby please, I'm down on my knees begging
I thirst for you girl
Baby I'm running to your well

[Chorus]
What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl

[Chorus]
What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl

[Chorus]
What can I do? What can I do?
To get back to your heart
I'd swim the Mississippi river
If you would give me another start, girl
