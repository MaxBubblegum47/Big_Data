[Verse 1]
Bend my finger back, snap! Wrap it in a paper towel
Break a twig in half and set it straight
Beat me with a wood bat, hit me with a canister
That's fired while the soldiers drive away
Bend my finger back, snap
On and on and on and on for days
Hit me with a wood bat, hit me like a Yankee
Like a son of freedom, never as a slave

[Chorus]
It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool

[Verse 2]
Bless me with a heart attack, a real crise cardiaque
And show me where to find the surgeon’s knife
Eviscerate me now, hack! Take me to my punishment
The punishment I needed all my life
Bend my finger back, snap!
On and on and on and on with strife
Listen to my bum rap, listen to the evidence
Exonerating me from being right

[Chorus]
It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool

[Post-Chorus]
You know that I’ve been wicked and the road to hell is wide
Cursed by curiosity that made us go inside
Everyone was charming but we took 'em for a ride
Baby, you’re not anybody’s fool

[Verse 3]
Bend my finger back, snap! Pack it in a paper towel
Break a twig in half and set it straight
Beat me with a wood bat, hit me with a canister
That's fired while the soldiers drive away
Bend my finger back, snap!
On and on and on and on for days
Hit me with a wood bat, hit me like a Yankee
Like a son of freedom, never as a slave

[Chorus]
It's etiquette, you idiot, spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby, you are mine
And baby, you're not anybody's fool

[Post-Chorus]
The harpsichord is broken and the television's fried
The city's getting hotter like a country in decline
Everyone's a coward when you look them in the eyes
But baby, you're not anybody's fool

[Spoken Interlude]
Sing "Next Year in Jerusalem"
You know, the one at 103rd and Broadway?
'Cause this Orthodox girl fell in love
With the guy at the falafel shop
And why not? Should she have averted her eyes
And just stared at the laminated poster of the Dome of the Rock?

[Bridge]
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood

[Outro]
Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die
Condolences to gentle hearts who couldn’t bear to try
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die
Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die
