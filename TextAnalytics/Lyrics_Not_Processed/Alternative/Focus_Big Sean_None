Focus

Focus can be the difference between on and off
Winning and losing
Good and great
Between great and the best

Focusing could be the most self-fulfilling thing you could do for yourself because with focus comes accomplishment
Focusing could bring out your greatest talents and give you true purpose in this world
It can take your natural ability and magnify it to extraordinary
One thing I learned and I'm sure most of us know is what you focus on
What you put your energy into
Is exactly what we should expect back
That's just the law of the universe

Karma
I seen it happen like 10,000 times
It is proven that 1+1 being two

Focus is the key to being successful in any situation
If you focus on the wrong, you'll get the wrong things
There's no way to focus on one thing and expect something different
How you focus on something is giving attention to it
Even if you don't like it and still focus on not liking it, you're still putting your attention to it and will still attract it

For example, if you focus on wanting a new car, you'll keep attracting the idea of wanting a new car
But it is easy to confuse that, because wanting a new car isn't the way to manifest it
You're simply just wanting a new car and not obtaining a new car
Remember, the intent of your focus is so important
There's a difference between focusing on wanting a new car and focusing on a car being yours
We really should be clear on what we focus on

Honestly, I feel like time is the most valuable thing we have ever been given and focus runs parallel to that
Because every second of the day we're focused on something, whether you realize it or not
I for sure am a victim of focusing on the wrong things sometimes
I spent a little too much time on my phone looking at comments, focusing on how it'd feel a little too long
But that's just human

It's very rare that you'd probably focus on 100% of your time on what you need to
But the biggest advantage is to quickly catch yourself and be able to reset your focus
For me, there's no way I could focus on something I don't love
At least not for long

I'm just not content with my spending my life miserable and I just personally can't live like that
It is not a party of vibration you could tell how you feel
Your inner guidance system
Your feelings
If I feel good, I'm doing the right thing
If not then it's not what I'm supposed to be doing

How does what you focus on makes you feel?
Remember, it's never too late or too early to know what makes you happy and to make that change by any means necessary
I went into my last album focused
I wanted to focus on making music that would change people's lives, help lift their moods up
Music that I felt that was undeniably great to me and talk about what directly affected me
And that's what I did
I never focused so much on executing these things while making music and what'd you know?
My first number one album and my most successful one yet

You can't measure success by anything but happiness
I say that all the time
And if you focus your energy on what makes you happy
What do you think will happen?
Exactly
It always work out

Rewire any thoughts you had prior and know that you are what you focus on
