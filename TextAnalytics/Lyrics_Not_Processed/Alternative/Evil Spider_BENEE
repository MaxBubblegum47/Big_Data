[Verse 1]
Baby, you've been threaded through my mind
Wanna wrap you up inside
Crazy, I’ma spin you till you're blind
Roll you up and make you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna tangle up in you
Don't be tempted to escape
Wishin’ it was just us two
'Cause she'll make you feel out of place
Wanna tangle up in you
Don't be tempted to escape
Wishin' it was just us two
Just us two

[Chorus]
I am a spider
Creep up behind ya
Promise not to bite
Unless you're hurting me
I am a spider
Creep up behind ya
Promise not to bite
Unless you're hurting me

[Verse 2]
Know I
Have all the ways to reel you in
Delicately, I will spin
Evil, bad intentions on my mind
Got my fangs out, better hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna tangle up in you
Don't be tempted to escape
Wishin’ it was just us two
’Cause she'll make you feel out of place
Wanna tangle up in you
Don’t be tempted to escape
Wishin' it was just us two
Just us two

[Chorus]
I am a spider
Creep up behind ya
Promise not to bite
Unless you're hurting me
I am a spider
Creep up behind ya
Promise not to bite
Unless you're hurting me

[Bridge]
Promise not to bite

[Chorus]
I am a spider
Creep up behind ya
Promise not to bite
Unless you’re hurting me
I am a spider
Creep up behind ya
Promise not to bite
Unless you're hurting me
