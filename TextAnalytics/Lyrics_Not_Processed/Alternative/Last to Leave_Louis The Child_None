You took it off the table then I put it back again
I’m really good at starting but I don’t know when it has to end
You’re leaving in reality I’m staying in pretend

Here I am
Here I am
Holding On
Here I am
Here I am
And you’re gone

I’m the last to leave the party
Don’t know when it’s time to go
When it’s clear to everybody
I’m always the last to know
I heard what you said
But I’m not ready yet
Dancing on my own
Like I don’t notice that you left
And when all the lights come on
It’s just me
Cuz I’m the last to leave

I don’t even notice, I don’t even notice
I don’t even notice, I don’t even notice


You told me that you needed space
I don’t know what you meant
You said that all we did is fight, that’s not how I remember it
Jumping in together whether it was sink or swim
But here I am
Here I am
All alone
Here I am
Here I am
And you’re gone

I’m the last to leave the party
Don’t know when it’s time to go
When it’s clear to everybody
I’m always the last to know
I heard what you said
But I’m not ready yet
Dancing on my own
Like I don’t notice that you left
And when all the lights come on
It’s just me
Cuz I’m the last leave

I’m the last to leave the party
Don’t know when it’s time to go
When it’s clear to everybody
I’m always the last to know
I heard what you said
But I’m not ready yet
Dancing on my  own
Like I don’t notice that you left
And when all the lights come on
It’s just me
Cuz I’m the last leave

I don’t even notice, I don’t even notice
I don’t even notice, I don’t even notice
