[Chorus]
If you come inside with me
I take you places you ain't seen before
Leave your man, he cheat
Just tie your laces, pack your bags and go
If you come inside with me
I take you places you ain't seen before
Leave your man, he cheat
Just tie your laces, pack your bags and go

[Verse]
I can double R my car
I got the double G my belt
She count the stars in my car, while I get lost in her smell
And them other girls smell like fish
All them other girls want my kids
When you walk in the room, they all stop what they do

[Bridge]

If you want
All my love
Don't let go and be mine (Be mine)
If you want
All my love
Don't let go and be mine (Be mine)

[Chorus]
If you come inside with me
I take you places you ain't seen before
Leave your man, he cheat
Just tie your laces, pack your bags and go
If you come inside with me
I take you places you ain't seen before
Leave your man, he cheat
Just tie your laces, pack your bags and go
