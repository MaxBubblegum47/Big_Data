[Intro]
Mmm

[Verse 1]
You could be here, but you're there
You could be anywhere
And these days I don't even care, no more
You only be showing me love whenever you've had too much
Or whatever's been filling your cup, no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, no more showing up when you're not sober
At my front door just to say you're alo-o-one tonight, yeah
You're tryna fuck me and my mind up
It's a reminder you're a liar, and you know-ow-ow I'm right

[Chorus]
You say you can't live without me (Yeah)
So why aren't you dead yet?
Why you still breathing? (Why, why)
If you say you can't live without me (You say)
Then why aren't you dead yet?
Why do you say that?

[Verse 2]
You could be here, but you're not
I give whatever you want, but you just take it and run
You run (Oh, run, run, run)
And I give you so many shots, but you just drinking 'em all
You never give it a thought, oh love (Ooh, whoa, aye, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, no more showing up when you're not sober (Sober)
At my front door just to say you're alo-o-one tonight (Alo-o-one tonight)
You're, tryna fuck me and my mind up
It's a reminder you're a liar, and you know-ow-ow I'm right

[Chorus]
You say you can't live without me (you say you can't live without)
So why aren't you dead yet?
Why you still breathin'? (Why, why)
If you say you can't live without me (You say)
Then why aren't you dead yet?
Why do you say that?

[Post-Chorus]
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why? (Ooh, whoa)
Why aren't you dead yet?

[Bridge]
Be careful what you say (You say)
Say only what you mean (You mean)
Mean to me, then you're nice
You're nice, you're nice
It's nice to know you now
Now that it all went down (Went down)
Down on your knees, you cry (You cry)
You cry, you cry, yeah

[Chorus]
You say you can't live without me (You said it)
So why aren't you dead yet? (So why aren't you dead)
Why you still breathing? (Why are you still breathin')
If you say you can't live without me (You said it)
Then why aren't you dead yet? (Why aren't you)
Why do you say that? (Why)

[Post-Chorus]
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why aren't you dead yet?
Why, why, why, why?
Why?
Why aren't you dead yet?
