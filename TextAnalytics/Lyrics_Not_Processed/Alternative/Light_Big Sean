[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh-huh, is it time?

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look, I spent my whole life tryna improvise
I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this, I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with

[Refrain: Big Sean]
You know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, 
hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Chorus: Jeremih & 
Big Sean
]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light
Hell nah, the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Got the whole city on fire
Boy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire
Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch
Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you're brown, they might hold you down and even hose you down, man
Since I'm his son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon

[Refrain: Big Sean]
So when they take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, 
and hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Chorus: Jeremih & 
Big Sean
]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
No, man they can't fuck with the light
Hell nah, the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Outro: Jeremih]
Don't let them take away your soul
No, no (No, no)
Don't let them take away what makes you whole
