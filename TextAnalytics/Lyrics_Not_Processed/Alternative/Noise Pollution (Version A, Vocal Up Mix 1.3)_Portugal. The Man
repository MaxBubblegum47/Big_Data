[Intro: John Gourley]
Hello, I'm, hello, I'm, hello, I'm
Hello, I'm introducing

[Verse 1: John Gourley & 
Zoe Manville
]
Hello, I'm introducing
Live leak the revolution
Go stream it now on demand
New world distribution
Let's make low resolutions
Let's reverse evolution
Let's leave behind this dry land
Crawl back to the ocean

[Pre-Chorus: Zoe Manville]
Act like you're over it, still be upset
Naturally gifted, I'm losing it
Act like you're over it, still be upset
Naturally gifted, down for heavy lifting

[Chorus: John Gourley & 
Mary Elizabeth Winstead
]
I know my rights, je t'aime Paris (
Je t'aime Paris
)
Live or die like c'est la vie (
C'est la vie
)
With my fist in the air, "je suis Charlie" (
Je suis Charlie
)
Can't ya see I'm feeling magnifique? (
Magnifique
)

[Post-Chorus: Zoe Manville]
So down, is there no hope?
I can't believe in no one
So down, is there no hope?
I can't believe in no one

[Interlude: John Gourley]
Out for me, out for me, out for me, out for me
They got it out for me, out for me, out for me, out for me

[Verse 2: John Gourley & 
Zoe Manville
]
Broke out the institution
Got lost in the confusion
Not mad, man, I'm a big fan
I love that "Noise Pollution"
It's in my constitution
Forever disillusioned
So, go on, keep on talkin'
Y'all can't take my bullshit
You can't take my bullshit
You can't take my bullshit

[Pre-Chorus: John Gourley]
Act like you're over it, still be upset
Naturally gifted, down for heavy lifting

[Chorus: John Gourley & 
Mary Elizabeth Winstead
]
I know my rights, je t'aime Paris (
Je t'aime Paris
)
Live or die like c'est la vie (
C'est la vie
)
With my fist in the air, "je suis Charlie" (
Je suis Charlie
)
Can't ya see I'm feeling magnifique? (
Magnifique
)

[Post-Chorus: Zoe Manville & 
Mary Elizabeth Winstead
]
So down, is there no hope? (
C'est la vie
)
I can't believe in no one (
I'm still feeling magnifique
)
So down, is there no hope?
I can't believe in no one

[Bridge: Mary Elizabeth Winstead]
Tu cries, tu souffres, (Haha) et tu souris
Tu broies du noir, et tu rougis
Tu cries, tu souffres, et tu souris
Tu broies du noir et tu souris
Ah-ah, ah-ah

[Chorus: John Gourley & 
Mary Elizabeth Winstead
]
I know my rights, je t'aime Paris (
Je t'aime Paris
)
Live or die like c'est la vie (
C'est la vie
)
With my fist in the air, "je suis Charlie" (
Je suis Charlie
)
Can't ya see I'm feeling magnifique? (
Magnifique
)
I know my rights, je t'aime Paris
Live or die like c'est la vie (
C'est la vie
)
Even when the world has it out for me
I'm still feeling magnifique

[Post-Chorus: Zoe Manville & 
John Gourley
]
So down, is there no hope? (
C'est la vie
)
I can't believe in no one (
Magnifique
)
So down, is there no hope?
I can't believe in no one

[Outro: John Gourley]
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
