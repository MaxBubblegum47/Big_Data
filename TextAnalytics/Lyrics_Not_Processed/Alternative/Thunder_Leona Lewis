[Verse 1]
First it was heaven
Everything roses and fire
You and I were golden
Now it's armageddon
And I woke up like a fighter
Building up a legion
You were rising like a star
Reigning like a king
While I was waiting in the wings

[Chorus]
And I won't wait any longer
When you left me down, I got stronger
If you wonder 'bout the lightning
I'm on the horizon
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Scared that you would miss out
Scared that I would shine without you
So you held me down, down
But this voice was getting loud
And it just wouldn't give in
Cause I was made to sing

[Chorus]
And I won't wait any longer
When you left me down, I got stronger
If you wonder 'bout the lightning
I'm on the horizon
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
(With the thunder)
(With the thunder)
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder

[Bridge]
With an empty heart, I am free again
For some things to start, some have to end
With an empty heart, I am free again
For some things to start, some have to end

[Chorus]
And I won't wait any longer
When you left me down, I got stronger
If you wonder 'bout the lightning
I'm on the horizon
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
(With the thunder)
(With the thunder)
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
