[Hook]
Na na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na
Na na na, na na na

[Verse 1]
I got a certain little girl, she's on my mind
No doubt about it, she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I ever had
Sometimes she's gonna
Make me feel so bad

[Hook]
Na na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na

[Pre-Chorus]
Hush, hush
I thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart but I love her
Just the same now
Hush, hush
Thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving
And I'm not to blame now

[Chorus]
(Love, love)
They got it early in the morning
(Love, love)
They got it late in the evening
(Love, love)
Well, I want that, need it
(Love, love)
Oh, I gotta gotta have it

[Verse 2]
She's got loving like quicksand
Only took one touch of her hand
To blow my mind and I'm in so deep
That I can't eat and I can't sleep

[Hook]
Na na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen, hush, hush
I thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart but I love her
Just the same now
Hush, hush
Thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving
And I'm not to blame now

[Chorus]
(Love, love)
They got it early in the morning
(Love, love)
They got it late in the evening
(Love, love)
Well, I want that, need it
(Love, love)
Yeah I gotta gotta have it

Na na na na
Na na na, na na na
