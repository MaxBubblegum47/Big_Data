[Verse 1]
Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who’s going to save a little warmth for me?
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

[Verse 2]
If I’m born again
I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace
But who’s gonna say a little grace for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

[Chorus]
I’m not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you, and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?

[Verse 3]
See the sun go down
It’s going on down and the night is deep
Want a little light
But who’s gonna save a little light for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

[Chorus]
I’m not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you, and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I’m not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you, and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?
