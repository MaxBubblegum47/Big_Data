[Intro]
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Came in like a vision from the old west wind
Like a bright new dream that I was steppin' in
I saw your face, and I knew it was a sign
And I still think about that moment
All of the time
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
You know that I could never make this up
I found the reason and I'm not givin' it up
I felt the fever, and I knew it was mine
Oh I'm gonna love you for a long time

[Chorus]
And in the mornin' when I'm waking up
I swear that you're the first thing that I'm thinkin' of
I feel it in my body
Know it in my mind, oh I
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time

[Verse 3]
Oh, I never knew it
Yeah you took me by surprise
While I was gettin' lost so deep inside your diamond eyes
So many things that I still want to say
And if devotion is a river
Then I'm floating away

[Chorus]
And in the mornin' when you pick me up
And all the world is quiet except the mourning dove
I feel it in my body
Know it in my mind, oh I
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time

[Bridge]
Don't slow down now
Come and break me down
Keep your hands in my hair
Keep your mouth on my mouth
Don't slow this down
Never let me go
Baby, don't you wanna see how far this thing can go?

[Chorus]
And in the mornin' when you wrap me up
I know that forever could never be enough
I feel it in my body
Know it in my mind, oh I
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
For a long time
Oh, I'm gonna love you for a long time

[Outro]
Ooh, I'm gonna love you for a long time
Yeah, I'm gonna love you for a long time
Won't you keep lettin' me love you for a long time
For a long, long, long, long time
I'm gonna love you for a long time
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
