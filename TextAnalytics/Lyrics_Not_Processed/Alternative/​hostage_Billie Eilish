[Verse 1]
I wanna be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Like a hostage

[Verse 2]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

[Chorus]
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you
Like a hostage
Like a hostage
