[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, what you wishin' for?
Maybe you should wish it more
Maybe the world is yours
Maybe when it rains, it pours (Keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore (Keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore, or do I?

[Post-Chorus]
Wish you'd get out my face, might go MIA
Might just blow my brain, I'd be Kurt Cobain
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face

[Verse]
I wish you would find your chill
'Cause Lord knows this shit get real
And for this price, you know you'd kill
Man, it's big brack, you know the deal
Man, it's big slatt, you know the deal
Draco a big dragon, fire hell
Can't save me, man, save yourself
'Cause I do not need no help

[Bridge]
Keep on wishin'
Keep on wishin'
Keep on wishin'
(Ooh-oh, oh-ah)

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, what you wishin' for?
Maybe you should wish it more
Maybe the world is yours
Maybe when it rains, it pours (Keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore (Keep on wishin')
I don't know how to wish anymore, or do I?

[Post-Chorus]
Wish you'd get out my face, might go MIA
Might just blow my brain, I'd be Kurt Cobain
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face, I can't feel my face

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, what you wishin' for?
Maybe you should wish it more
Maybe the world is yours
Maybe when it rains, it pours
I don't know how to wish anymore
I don't know how to wish anymore, or do I?

[Outro]
(Ooh-oh, oh-ah)
