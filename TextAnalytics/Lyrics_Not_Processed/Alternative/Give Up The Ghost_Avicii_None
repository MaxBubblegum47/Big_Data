[Verse]
Some say that love is a motherfucker
But you'll know better than any other ooohhh
Give Up The Ghost
Ain't gonna cry for the photograph
Lost something that I never had ooohhh
Give Up The Ghost


Feel the lungs when you fight me when you want it
Feel the sting and you know that I lost you on my due
Give Up The Ghost

[Chorus]
Walk the days trying to shame this misery
But tonight is not a moment to set you free
Give Up The Ghost
Give Up The Ghost

Face Down in the pool of a misery
Now I know you are bad what you've done to me ooohhh
Give Up The Ghost

Now you're bad feeling the ash like a cigarette
Shot them down but now I'm back from the dead ooohhh
Give Up The Ghost
Give Up The Ghost
Gotta Give Up The Ghost

[Outro]
Walk The Days trying to shame this misery
Tonight is not a moment to set you free
Gotta Give Up The Ghost
