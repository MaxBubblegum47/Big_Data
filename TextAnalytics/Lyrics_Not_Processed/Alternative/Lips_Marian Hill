[Verse 1]
Sinking fast, undertow
Pull me in, don't let go
On your mark, ready set
Feel your breath, on my neck

[Chorus]
Your lips
They got me going
Heart flips
You got me floating
Your lips, (y-y-your lips)
Your lips (y-y-your lips)

[Chorus]
Your lips
They got me going
Heart flips
You got me floating
Your lips, (y-y-your lips)
Your lips (y-y-your lips)

[Verse 2]
Overwhelmed, hazy eyes
Staring at tinted skies
And I like, what we do
Running wild, just us two
(Two, two, t-t-two
)

[Chorus]
Your lips
They got me going
Heart flips
You got me floating
Your lips, (y-y-your lips)
Your lips (y-y-your lips)

[Chorus]
Your lips
They got me going
Heart flips
You got me floating
Your lips, (y-y-your lips)
Your lips (y-y-your lips)

[Chorus]
Your lips
They got me going
Heart flips
You got me floating
Your lips, (y-y-your lips)
Your lips (y-y-your lips)

[Chorus]
Your lips
They got me going
Heart flips
You got me floating
Your lips, (y-y-your lips)
Your lips (y-y-your lips)

[Bridge]
Sip each second, drink it slowly
Watch the hours melt away

[Bridge]
Sip each second, drink it slowly
Watch the hours melt away

[Chorus]
Your lips
They got me going
Heart flips
You got me floating
Your lips, (y-y-your lips)
Your lips (y-y-your lips)

[Chorus]
Your lips
They got me going
Heart flips
You got me floating
Your lips, (y-y-your lips)
Your lips (y-y-your lips)

[Chorus]
Your lips
They got me going
Heart flips
You got me floating
Your lips, (y-y-your lips)
Your lips (y-y-your lips)
