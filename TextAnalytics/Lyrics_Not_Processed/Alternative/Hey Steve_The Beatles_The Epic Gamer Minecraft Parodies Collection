Hey Steve
Don’t leave the game
Take some oak logs and craft some planks
Remember to never dig straight down
Then you begin to play Minecraft
Hey Steve
Don’t log off
Build a house and craft a sword
The minute you head into the mine
Then you begin to play Minecraft
And any time you see some mobs
Hey Steve, kill them
Don’t eat the flesh from the zombies
For when you know that you’re a noob
You forget torches and find some coal ore in the dark
Hey Steve
Don’t quit Minecraft
You have iron, now go and smelt it
Remember to use some coal for fuel
Then you begin to play Minecraft
So put it in and watch it smelt into ingots
And craft them into some armor
And don’t you know that there are mobs
That want to kill you
Take your sword and kill them all
Hey Steve
Don’t leave the game
Take some oak logs and craft some planks
Remember to never dig straight down
Then you begin to play Minecraft
Minecraft
Minecraft
Minecraft
Minecraft
Minecraft
Oh yeah
Na, na, na, na na na na, na na na na, hey Steve
Na, na, na, na na na na, na na na na, hey Steve
