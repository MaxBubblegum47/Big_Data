[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
Nigga, talk shit, I'll single you out
If you've got a problem, we can figure it out
I'm from H-Town, but the gold in my mouth
Southside niggas put a hole in your house
A hole in your spouse
Better think twice 'fore you open your mouth
It's getting real close to the first of the month
Niggas hit licks, for the gas and the blunt
Send 'em to the doc, gotta open them up
Niggas load guns in the back of the truck
Niggas hate money til they laced with gold
Gotta get a gun for your hateful foes
Flex too hard and your casket close
You don't want your momma come
And get you from the morgue
Tall white T, blood on the floor
Oh, don't say that

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Ohh-ohh-ohh, I feel like Master P
I ain't no slave, ain't lettin no one try to master me
I'm getting tested, tested, but nobody passing me
Ain't sugar coating shit, don't need them extra calories
It's a machine, that's why we work inside the factory
Put 'em up for me, display it, like it's a gallery
Don't need your salary, gold on me, like it's alchemy
Giving niggas the battery when they witness the mastery
Oh, don't say that, don't talk to me, we don't play that
They got chalk for me, I make outlines, like it's pottery
I got a squad full of fucking oddities
I got squash, apricots and broccoli
We turn weird shit to a commodity
I'm on a odyssey for real quality
It's like, oh

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
I look like a Somali pirate (Don't say that!)
Failed middle school and college (Don't say that!)
Daddy say I'm an asshole (Don't say that!)
Dick complexion of a Backwoods (Ew, don't say that)
She text me, dry as the Sahara (Aw-wah!)
After she get in that casa Merlyn (Straight up!)
I was in that mouth like flouride
That pussy tight as a hair tie (Ah! Ooh, ooh)
Scrunchie, I'm so horny, baby, bitch, your house, pussy, baby
When I get the munchies I steal, I don't share roaches, baby
Bum with the good haircut
Bum with a good haircut, mattress and magic dick

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
