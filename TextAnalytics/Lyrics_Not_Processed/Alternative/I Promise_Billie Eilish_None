{Background Vocals/Sample= Billie Eilish}

[Intro- Billie Eilish & Young Judo]
(Take me, to the rooftop, I wanna see,)
(The world when I stop breathing, turning)
(Blue... Tell me, Love is endless, don’t be,)
(So pretentious, leave me, like you do...)

[Chorus- Young Judo]
I’m sorry, I couldn’t give you what you wanted, I couldn’t tell you what you needed, but I need you, I Promise that
I know, I’ve learned from mistakes, I hope that you know, you didn’t make the list of regrets, that I keep on my mind

[Verse- Young Judo]
I’m sorry, if I don’t meet expectations
I know you’re not into relations, I Promise, you’ve made that clear
I hope that, you can forgive me, when the sun goes down, there isn’t anybody else around, that makes me feel like you, dear
I Promise, that I won’t hurt you anymore, babe, I know it’s bad for me but I still stay with you, I can’t forget
About you, I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do, please baby tell me what I can do, just to be there with you
Because I’m sorry, I don’t care what I have to do, I just wanna tell you that I need you
I need you, I need you, please..

[Chorus- Young Judo]
I’m sorry, I couldn’t give you what you wanted, I couldn’t tell you what you needed, but I need you, I Promise that
I know, I’ve learned from mistakes, I hope that you know, you didn’t make the list of regrets, that I keep on my mind

[Outro- Billie Eilish & Young Judo]
(Take me, to the rooftop, I wanna see,)
(The world when I stop breathing, turning)
(Blue... Tell me, Love is endless, don’t be,)
(So pretentious, leave me, like you do...)
