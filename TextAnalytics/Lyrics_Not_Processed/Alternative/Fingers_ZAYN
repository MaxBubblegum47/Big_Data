[Verse 1]
Fucked and I want ya
Looked and I loved ya
Stuck, now I need ya
Hopin' I'd see ya
Touch, wanna feel her
Much can't conceal her, no
Hiding all your features
Sliding on the filters
Should be you that's in the middle
Don't be hiding what you thinkin'

[Chorus]
I been fucked and I want ya, I can't even text ya
'Cause my fingers ain't working, but my heart is
If you wanna, let me know where you are, then
I can come and love (I can come and love)
I can come and love (I can come and love ya)
I can come and love ya (I can come and love)
I can come and love ya (I can come and love ya)

[Verse 2]
What did I tell ya? Typo said I loved ya
Didn't mean what I was sayin'
No, I wasn't playin', just confused
Was tryna play it smooth
Stood spinnin' in this room
In this state I been consumed
State I been consumed

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm fucked and I want ya, I can't even text ya
'Cause my fingers ain't working, but my heart is
If you wanna, let me know where you are, then
I can come and love (I can come and love)
I can come and love (I can come and love ya)
I can come and love ya (I can come and love)
I can come and love ya (I can come and love ya)

[Bridge]
I know it's taking all your strength to keep restrained
'Cause you got different things replacing
Old feelings that you felt
Now you seen it for yourself
Where's the shame? No shame in what you need

[Chorus]
Fucked and I want ya, I can't even text ya
'Cause my fingers ain't working, but my heart is
If you wanna, let me know where you are, then
I can come and love (I can come and love)
I can come and love (I can come and love ya)
I can come and love ya (I can come and love)
I can come and love ya (I can come and love ya)
