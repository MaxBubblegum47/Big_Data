[Chorus]
And I just popped another one, another one
I just rolled another blunt, another blunt
We pulled up in a Bentley truck, we had to stunt
We pulled up in that Bentley truck, we had to stunt, had to stunt, yeah
I take drugs to ease my pain, whoa-oa
Yeah, I make money, that's my dream, whoa-oa

And I just fuck a different slut, a different slut
I'm always on the road, yeah, and that's whats up
I pop another perc or two, I fuck that bitch
We all up in the mansion house, we gettin lit, gettin lit yeah

[Verse]
All my niggas rich as fuck, we rich as fuck
Always pullin deep too, we need them drugs, yeah
I do what I want now, cause I'm rich too, yeah
I do what I want now, I love my lifestyle, yeah
I know a couple crazy kids, cut their wrists
I know a couple crazy kids, that's with the shits
Imma pop a xan down, and I slow down
Imma pop a xan now then I slow down, slow down yeah

[Chorus]
And I just popped another one, another one
I just rolled another blunt, another blunt
We pulled up in a Bentley truck, we had to stunt
We pulled up in that Bentley truck, we had to stunt, had to stunt, yeah
I take drugs to ease my pain, Whoa-oa
Yeah, I make money, that's my dream Whoa-oa
And I just fuck a different slut, a different slut
I'm always on the road yeah, and that's whats up
I pop another perc or two, I fuck that bitch
All up in the mansion house, we gettin lit, gettin lit yeah
