Can't count the numbers with my hands
I've only got ten fingers
Forever's longer than we planned
It lingers, it lingers
Absolute everything and absolute nothing are the same in length
And they're much, much bigger than us
It's a verity of man
But there's no clarity in "all or nothing"
When there's quantity we can
Find some clarity in something
That's why we can't imagine space
It's too big
We stay on our planet
That's why Janet's too scared to fly through the stars
She thinks she's limited and they're infinite
How could she live in it, she thinks she's not up to par
That's why we can't imagine death or rebirth
It's way too small and too big
Stuck in our life and that's why strife makes us feel nice
Makes us feel present, comprehensive
We learn lessons, and we're forced to think twice
Think twice
It's a variety of man
But there's no clarity in all or nothing
When there's quantity we can
Find some clarity in something
