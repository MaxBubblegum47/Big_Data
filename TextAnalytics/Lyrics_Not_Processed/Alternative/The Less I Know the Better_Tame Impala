[Verse 1]
Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather"
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

[Chorus]
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind?
So goodbye

[Verse 2]
She said, "It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

[Chorus]
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind?

[Outro]
I was doing fine without ya
Till I saw your face, now I can't erase
Giving in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want? Is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya
Till I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
Said, "Come on, Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on, Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on, Superman, say your stupid line"
