[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2: blackbear]
Yeah, yeah-eah-eah
I ain't really trippin' if you wanna go
I know I made you cry last year when I was on the road
I meant it when I said it, you can always hit my phone
(213) 267-9932, girl you know-ow-ow
I'ma make this fetty, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I never would forget you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Look me in my eyes, tell me you ain't a part of me, no fair

[Chorus: Billie Eilish &
 blackbear
 & 
Both
]
No fair
 
(Yeah, yeah-eah-eah)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
 
(Girl, I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes 
(Ocean eyes)
No fair 
(No fair, no fair)
You really know how to make me cry 
(Know how to make me cry)
When you give me those ocean eyes 
(Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared 
(I'm scared)
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes

[Outro: Billie Eilish]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
