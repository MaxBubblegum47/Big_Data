[Verse 1]
I'm caught up when you look at me
You let my heart breathe with ease
Chasing stars in our galaxy
Making our own make-believe
I want you when the sun goes low
Your body warmth wants me close
You say you're always by my side
'Til my blood runs dry

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I won't be the same without you
Don't let this moment slip away

[Chorus]
I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to you

[Verse 2]
Freeze time when we align
Our love won't be confined
No way that the eye can hide
'Til my blood runs dry

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I won't be the same without you
Don't let this moment slip away

[Chorus]
I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh, say you love me too
Here to stay, you and I
Dancing in the colour of the golden light
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to you

[Bridge]
I close my eyes
I don't wanna escape
Let the tides rise in my heart

[Chorus]
I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh, say you love me too
Here to stay, you and I
Dancing in the colour of the golden light
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to you
