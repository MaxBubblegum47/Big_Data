[Verse 1]
I don't know what lies ahead
It's all a mystery man, I heard it said
You do your thing, you do your best
I take a guess at what happen next

[Chorus]
All I've got is what I need
And that's enough, as far as I can see
Why should I walk into the great unknown
When I can sit here, and throw my bones?

[Verse 2]
I hear the future is so divine
But I'll just wait until I get a sign
'Cause what I've got here, what I'm holding in my hand
Is better for me than some promised land

[Chorus]
All I've got is what I need
And that's enough, as far as I can see
Why should I walk into the great unknown
When I can sit here, and throw my bones?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
What's the rush? Who's to say?
You can't escape tomorrow, it's another day
I'm hanging here, I'm here on solid ground
'Cause heaven's full, or closing down

[Chorus]
All I've got is what I need
And that's enough, as far as I can see
Why should I walk into the great unknown
When I can sit here, and throw my bones?
Oh yeah

[Instrumental Outro]
