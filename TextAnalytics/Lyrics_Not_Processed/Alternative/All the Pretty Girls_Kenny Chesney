[Verse 1]
All the pretty girls said pick me up at eight
All the pretty girls said I'm going to L.A
All the pretty girls said I hate my hair
Talking to the mirror in their underwear
All the lost boys said I just got paid
All the lost boys said I wanna get laid
When the town goes blue and the lights blink red
All the lost boys do what all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Verse 2]
All the sheriffs said kid, you better slow down
All the preachers said it's the devil's playground
I wonder if they knew they were wasting their breath
All I ever heard was all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Bridge]
All the seventeens said I'm getting outta dodge
All the big dreams said I'm selling all I got
All the high rollers busy placing their bets
Me, I'm heading south cause all the pretty girls said

[Chorus]
I'm home for the summer, shoot out the lights
Don't blow my cover, oh I'm free tonight
I'm coming over, call all your friends
Somebody hold me, all the pretty girls said

[Post-Chorus]
All of the whiskey went to my head
Shut up and kiss me, all the pretty girls said

[Outro]
All the pretty girls said
