[Verse 1]
Painter
Come colour up my life
Oh painter
Come colour up my life
Take away the misery
Take away the strife

[Verse 2]
Writer
Write me out a play
Writer
Make the meaning gay
Oh I don't need a podium
Just give me words to say

[Verse 3]
Singer
Let me sing a song
Singer
Let me sing a song
You don't have to worry
'Cause singer you can sing along
