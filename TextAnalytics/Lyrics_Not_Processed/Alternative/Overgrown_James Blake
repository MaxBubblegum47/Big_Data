[Verse]
And I want you to know
I took it with me
That when things are thrown away like they are daily
Time passes and the constants stay

[Chorus]
So if that is how it is
I don’t wanna be a star
But a stone on the shore
A lone doorframe in a wall
When everything’s overgrown
But what she really really wanted was my rights and my wrongs
And I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along

[Verse]
And I want you to know
I took it with me
That when things are thrown away like they are daily
Time passes and the constants stay

[Chorus]
So if that is how it is
I don’t wanna be a star
But a stone on the shore
A lone doorframe in a wall
When everything’s overgrown
But what she really really wanted was my rights and my wrongs
And I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along
And I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along
And I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along

[Verse]
And I want you to know
I took it with me
That when things are thrown away like they are daily
Time passes and the constants stay
Time passes and the constants stay
Time passes and the constants stay
Time passes and the constants stay
