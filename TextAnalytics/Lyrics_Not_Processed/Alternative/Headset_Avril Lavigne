[Verse 1]
See, I got a little bit of a problem
Back where I come from
Feels like five people in my population
And no-one ever leaves there
I'm gonna be the first one
I guess my papa always told me the way it was
And my mama thinks she knows me, I know she doesn't
Ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
But I've got my head set on California
I'll fly away tomorrow
Won't even warn ya
And I'll send a big postcard
Just to piss you off
I've got my head set on California
Here I come

[Verse 2]
See, I got what you would call an obsession
It feels like a think stain
The limits of a small town frustration' my brain
Might leave some roots there
But my head's on the next plane
Cause my daddy always tells me the way it was
And my mama thinks she knows me, I know she doesn't
Ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
I've got my head set on California
I'll fly away tomorrow
Won't even warn ya
And I'll send a big postcard
Just to piss you off
I've got my head set on California
Here I come
Here I come

[Bridge]
Papa always tells me the way it was
And my mama thinks she knows me, I know she doesn't
Ah, ah, ah
But I've got my head set on New York City
I'll fly away tomorrow
Won't even miss me
And I'll get a big boyfriend
Just to piss you off

[Chorus]
I've got my head set on California
I'll fly away tomorrow
Won't even warn ya
And I'll send a big postcard
Just to piss you off
I've got my head set on California
Here I come
Here I come
