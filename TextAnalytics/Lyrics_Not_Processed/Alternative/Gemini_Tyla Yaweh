[Intro]
O-oh, yeah yeah, yeah
Hector Soundz
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Switching up her role, such a Gemini
Can't make up her mind, like a Gemini
She stay on the road, take off in the night
Always a surprise, such a Gemini
Never tell her no, when she catch a vibe
She go side to side, like a Gemini
Show up to my show, she don't stand in line
Always stayin' high, that's my Gemini, Gemini

[Verse 1]
She got a lotta love to give away
"Need you here with me" is what she say
She don't wanna go out her way
I don't really mind anyways
I'm on the west side and I'm
Ready for the ride of my life
So I'm coming out your way

[Pre-Chorus]
Touching on her then she wanna put my hands away, yeah
She the type to keep me on my toes
One moment she up and then she low
I heat her up and then she actin' cold
But she already know

[Chorus]
Switching up her role, such a Gemini
Can't make up her mind, like a Gemini
She stay on the road, take off in the night
Always a surprise, such a Gemini
Never tell her no, when she catch a vibe
She go side to side, like a Gemini
Show up to my show, she don't stand in line
Always stayin' high, that's my Gemini, Gemini

[Verse 2]
She tell me time to time that she ain't crazy
But the way she actin' now lookin' hazy
And when we in the bed she never lazy
She keep it real smart, real brainy
I put it on her right and I
Do it how she like every night
So I'm headed to her place

[Pre-Chorus]
Touching on her then she wanna put my hands away, yeah
She the type to keep me on my toes
One moment she up and then she low
I heat her up and then she actin' cold
But she already know

[Chorus]
Switching up her role, such a Gemini
Can't make up her mind, like a Gemini
She stay on the road, take off in the night
Always a surprise, such a Gemini
Never tell her no, when she catch a vibe
She go side to side, like a Gemini
Show up to my show, she don't stand in line
Always stayin' high, that's my Gemini, Gemini
