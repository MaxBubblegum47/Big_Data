[Verse 1]
As a young girl
Louis Vuitton
With your mother
On a sandy lawn
As a sophomore
With reggaeton
And the linens
You're sittin' on

[Chorus]
Is your bed made? Is your sweater on?
Do you want to fuck like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But it feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

[Verse 2]
Can you stay up
To see the dawn?
In the colors
Of Benetton

[Chorus]
Is your bed made? Is your sweater on?
Do you want to,
 
like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Is your bed made? Is your sweater on?
Do you wanna,
 
like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
