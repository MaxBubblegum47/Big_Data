[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
I'll dive in deeper, deeper for you
Down to the bottom, 10,000 emerald pools
Down to the bottom, 10,000 emerald pools

[Pre-Chorus]
Under water
Time is standing still
You're the treasure
Dive down deeper, still

[Chorus]
All I need is you
You're all I need to breathe
All I need is you

[Verse 2]
I'll make a living, trying to get away
10,000 fathoms, under a tidal wave
It can never pull me away
No way

[Pre-Chorus]
Under water
Time is standing still
You're the treasure
Dive down deeper, still

[Chorus]
All I need is you
You're all I need to breathe
All I need is you
You're all I need to breathe

[Bridge]
Down to the bottom, 10,000 emerald pools
(Ooh)
(You're all I need to breathe)
I'll dive in deeper, deeper for you
(Ooh)
(You're all I need to breathe)

[Chorus]
All I need is you
All I need is you
It can never pull me away
Time is standing still
No way!
Dive down deeper, still
All I need is you
You're all I need to breathe
All I need is you
