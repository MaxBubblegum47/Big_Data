[Intro]
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather

[Verse 1]
Rose-colored boy
I hear you making all that noise
About the world you want to see
And oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of
The optimist in me

[Pre-Chorus]
But hearts are breaking, and wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
I'm right at the end of my rope
A half empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll choke

[Chorus]
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

[Post-Chorus]
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather

[Verse 2]
I want you to stop insisting that I'm not
A lost cause, 'cause I've been through a lot
Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off
If it's all right by you

[Pre-Chorus]
But hearts are breaking, and wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
And you're turning it into a joke
A half empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll...

[Chorus]
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

[Bridge]
(Hm, hm, hm, hm)
(Hoo-hoo-hoo)
Leave me here a little bit longer
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
You say "We gotta look on the bright side"
I say "Well, maybe if you wanna go blind"
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
But boy, you ain't ever seen my mind

[Chorus]
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
I know we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

[Outro]
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather
