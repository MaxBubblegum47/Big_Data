[Intro]

[Verse 1: James Arthur]
I know you get tongue-tied, and you trip over your words
Spend all of your young life on your tiptoes, and it hurts
Feel like you break down every other day
You know it's okay not to be okay
Feels like you piss people off whenever you talk
Tired of this tightrope, this tightrope you walk
Darling, you're way, way too hard on yourself
I don't know why, why you don't ask for help

[Pre-Chorus: James Arthur]
It doesn't mean we're giving up the fight now
Everybody needs a place to hide out, hide out

[Chorus: James Arthur]
Come, come meet me at my treehouse
Yeah, we'll be blowing sweet clouds
Yeah, we can pretend the world's just you and me
When the lights are out below us (Oh, oh)
If you ever start to freak out (Freak out)
Come meet me at my treehouse
We can forget the world, just you and me
Aw yeah, it's alright, alright, alright now

[Post-Chorus: Sofia Reyes]
It's alright, alright, alright now
It's alright, alright, alright now
It's alright, it's alright (It's alright, alright, alright now)

[Verse 2: Sofia Reyes]
Sometimes what I feel inside is hard to show
Try to do the right thing but it goes up in smoke
Estar sin estar es vivir sin vivir
Poder respirar no es saber existir
Sometimes I wish there was a switch or a cure
Something to take all the hate out the world
No sé porque nos guardamos lo peor
Abramos los ojos y el corazón (Y el corazón)

[Pre-Chorus: Sofia Reyes]
Todo brilla más cuando se apaga
Everybody needs a place to hide, yeah, hide

[Chorus: James Arthur & Sofia Reyes]
Come, come meet me (You) at my treehouse
Yeah, we'll be blowing sweet clouds
Yeah, we can pretend the world's just you and me
When the lights are out below us (Oh, oh)
If you ever start to freak out (Freak out)
Come meet me at my treehouse
We can forget the world, just you and me (Just you and me)
Aw yeah, it's alright, alright, alright now

[Post-Chorus: James Arthur, 
Sofia Reyes
 & 
Both

You can say whatever you like (
Say
)
Ain’t no judging up in this height (
Si
)
You can be who you are with me
It’s alright, alright, alright now

[Outro: Sofia Reyes]
Solos tu y yo, solo tu y yo (It's alright, alright, alright now)
Solos tu y yo, solo tu y yo (It's alright, alright, alright now)
Solos tu y yo, solo tu y yo (It's alright, alright, alright now)
It's alright, alright, alright now
