[Intro]
Whew
M8V3N, M8V3N gang
Shoota, shoota, that's shoota gang
That's my gang, 
gltt bah
Gang, 
gang

[Verse 1: Sleepy Hallow]
It's just me and my weapon (gang, gang)
Big chops gon' fold em' up, frost roll em' up, no question
4 deep in the Tahoe
4,5 chapo
Trey gang spins through blockos
They don't like it
I know they don't like it
I do it for my niggas and I do it for my hitters (gang, gang, gang)
Couple niggas that's with me, they with it, they my killers
Young nigga from the back blocks
Big crips don't strips, get cash out tracks spots
Money coming
Money coming feel like I hit the jackpot
I was home alone, Macaulay Culkin
Grabbed the .40 started dumping
Got to finesse
Play my music, they be bumping
I turn nothing into something
Settle for less? No, I can not
I just be trapping and moving a lot
Don't fuck with niggas who talk to the cops
Slide on my guy and we off on ya top
Can't trust these bitches they setting the drop

[Verse 2: Sheff G]
They junking & lagging like wifi
K and the 4 know that's my guys
Pull up we change the scenario
Get the drop if you want, bullets tearing 'em
I just remove all the pounds and material
I mask up get to bugging, fuck a discussion
Search up the block and take care of 'em
Know my hitters go stupid
No pick and choosing
Bitches in Bagen get [?] with 'em
Double G got the Ruger
Run up and bruise 'em

[Verse 3: Double G]
BOOM BOOM
I was broke
I got my cheddar up
Bitches get shot to call Kima to wet her up
Glock with a stick ain't no letting up
Hollows go straight through Mcqueen's and they bend 'em up
Spinning they block in a Tesla
See that we lit now she wanna get next to us
Where I'm from we keep the weapon tucked
Keep ya mouth close or we killing the messenger

[Verse 4: Sleepy Hallow]
M8V3N gang let them Ruger's hang
If you talking tough we leave 'em stuck
I just chase me a check ain't no checking me
I'm on the corner you watch like a ref
Niggas they plot on me
No, ain't no stopping me
Play with that money, Monopoly
Kick the work I get to cashin'
Puma fit for the fashion
Sheff 'gon tack him

[Verse 5: Double G]
Pop his ass like a Xan
Double G got the pam plus I got the bands
Niggas flexing for the Gram
Desert Eagle won't jam, hit him and his mans
Running ricky
, yeah he ran
Gang hot need a fan, shooting out the van, 
skrtt
Shawty I just want the top
I don't even wanna fuck, just pass her to my mans, 
thotty
Hit him up, watch him drop
Speeding running from the cops, never gon' stop (gang, gang)
Hit him up he yelling "Stop!"
Double G 83, call me 2 Glocks
And he fucking with the opp's
Niggas think this shit is cool until you get shot
Stupid I'm the wrong one
Flexing thinking shit is sweet until you get got

[Verse 6: Sleepy Hallow]
Hit him up
Nigga duck
Free my gang winna till they send us up
Free Money, free Fresh
Free my guys, all my guys, never gon' stretch
Please don't panic, shots start blamin'
Don't know shit? Start dashing
Anything started I'm finishing
Niggas be shooters but never be hitting shit
Said they caught me lacking but ain't nothing happened, had them niggas running like Rick!
Ain't nobody got me
Niggas tryna get me so I gotta stay with my grip
All that talking talking, we gon get to smoking
Tell the opp's "Get off my dick!"
If you really with it, I could really give it
I just gotta get all my shit (gang, gang)

[Verse 7: Sheff G and Double G]
They know that we do it better (whew!)
They know that we did it first, 
racks, racks
They know that we do 'em worst, 
glttt
Used to carry trey pounds every time in my shawty purse
But tell 'em 
"Ain't no fucking truce" 
nah!
That's why we the reason why y'all niggas hating, only tough behind the booth
I could never relate
Faking while I was skipping the jakes
Smashing the gas up
Skrt on the backup
Speed in the stoley, we brag about it
We dip from the boys just to laugh about it, 
skrtt
Run up we bust at the cab and we steady attacking, them niggas be sad about it
We getting money, they mad about it
They talk on the low
They do not want war
We hitting these opp's but don't brag about it
I'm kicking the door
Your bitch in the score
Trap out the spot, keep a happy wallet

[Verse 8: Sleepy Hallow]
So why they watching tryna see my pockets?
Hit 'em up until we see 'em dropping
Don't play with niggas, get to spraying niggas, niggas talk a lot but never be about it
