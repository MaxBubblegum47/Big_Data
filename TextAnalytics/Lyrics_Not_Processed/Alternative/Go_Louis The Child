[Verse 1]
Water-thin, can't get in
What you runnin' for?
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go
Overtime, I'm overtime
I've heard it all
What is it you wanna know?
The fuck is it you wanna know

[Chorus]
Filling your head up, it won't be better 'til you're
Filling your head up
Filling your head up, it won't be better 'til you're
Filling your head up
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go

[Verse 2]
Walls are thin, fallin' in
Knockin' down the door
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go
After all the time, all the lives
I found the fall
What is it you're waitin' for?
The fuck is it you're waitin' for

[Chorus]
Filling your head up, it won't be better 'til you're
Filling your head up
Filling your head up, it won't be better 'til you're
Filling your head up
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go

[Outro]
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go
Where is it you wanna go?
Where is it you wanna go
