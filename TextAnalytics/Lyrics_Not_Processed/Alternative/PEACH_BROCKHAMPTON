[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you

[Verse: Ryan Beatty & Kevin Abstract]
You wanna talk
The words rollin' out
I'll be right there
I'll save you from your bedroom
Move to Utah (I'll be there)
And I'll be okay (I'll be there)
The reason I thank you
I know heaven don't exist for fools

[Extended Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
