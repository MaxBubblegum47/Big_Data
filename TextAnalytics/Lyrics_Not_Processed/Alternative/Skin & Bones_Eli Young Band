[Chorus]
She's in my skin and bones
She's grace and glory
She's a backroads home
She's a long story
Yeah, the one goodbye that I can't even imagine
She's a well thought out plan and I don't know how it happened
She's in my skin and bones
She's in my skin and bones

[Verse 1]
Now if life is just an old car
And love is just the wheels that keep it rollin'
Every engine needs a spark, yeah
And she's the fire that's kept me goin'

[Chorus]
She's in my skin and bones
She's grace and glory
She's a backroads home
She's a long story
Yeah, the one goodbye that I can't even imagine
She's a well thought out plan and I don't know how it happened
She's in my skin and bones
She's in my skin and bones

[Verse 2]
Yeah, if a fight is like a shot of whiskey
Then forgiveness is a pill I'll be takin' in the mornin'
She'll smile and then she'll kiss me, yeah
Sayin' "Baby you can't win and you know it"

[Chorus]
She's in my skin and bones
She's grace and glory
She's a backroads home
She's a long story
She's the one goodbye that I can't even imagine
She's a well thought out plan and I don't know how it happened
She's in my skin and bones
She's in my skin and bones

[Verse 3]
In my heart, in my head, in my hands, in my bed
She is a drug runnin' through my blood
She's in my skin and bones
She's in my skin and bones
