[Intro Chorus]
All I wanna do is
Live in ecstasy, I know what's best for me
I can't help it, it's this hopeless itch
I just wanna feel (Wanna feel)
Purple, yellow, red and blue

[Verse 1]
When I grow up I wanna be
A movie star or on TV
'Cause workin' just don't work for me
But I can't focus, feeling hopeless
So I'll just sit back, try to look mean

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is
Live in ecstasy, I know what's best for me
I can't help it, it's this hopeless itch
I just wanna feel (Wanna feel)
Purple, yellow, red and blue

[Verse 2]
When I grow up I wanna be
A rich-kid born celebrity
It's not greed but necessity
Now, I don't focus on the hopeless
When I look out it's only for me

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is
Live in ecstasy, I know what's best for me
I can't help it, it's this hopeless itch
I just wanna feel (Wanna feel)
Purple, yellow, red and blue

[Post-Chorus]
I just (Evil) wanna be evil
I just (Evil) wanna be evil
Wanna be evil, wanna be evil
I just wanna be evil
I just (Evil) wanna be evil
I just (Evil) wanna be evil
Wanna be evil, wanna be evil
Purple, yellow, red and blue

[Bridge]
All that I needed
Is something to believe in
'Cause everything just falls in place like that
All that I needed
Is something to believe in
'Cause everything just falls in place like that
