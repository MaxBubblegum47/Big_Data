[Intro]
Oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my god

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Thirteen years old when I jumped off the porch
Y'all was playing Playstation, I was playing with the torch
You got a whooping with a belt, I was whipping with the fork
I was trapping, skipping school, so I had to go to court
Thirteen years old, got down with the set
Robbing niggas with the tech, my OG's were smoking wet
You was running on the court, shooting shots at the net
I was running up in spots with the Glock on Bissonnet

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
I was twelve years old when the cops kicked the door
Had the gun to my momma, baby sister on the floor
My pops caught a fed case so the jury had to go
Had to get it ten toes, as a man I had to grow
Had to show my lil brother how to trap and get dough
Digiscale with the cup, we was bagging up the dro'
One year went by, we was selling out the 'bo
Had packs and our straps, we was posted by the store
Till my big bro Tu showed me how to get mo'
When the weed got slow, showed me how to whip the stone
Microwave or the oven, he ain't never use the stove
Showed me how to hit licks, he a kick-door pro
My cousin Steve Dolla showed me how to break a ho
We both flipped Chelsea Jordan, that's a long time ago
Finessing lil convo, she make dough pronto
Robbing niggas, selling drugs, getting money, all I know

[Refrain: Maxo Kream]
A lot of y'all bluffing, I'm pimping, y'all cuffing
Same bitch, you be loving be sucking and fucking
She ain't got no money then we not discussing
I'm shooting up niggas, no fighting, no fussing
Seen niggas get killed over making assumptions
The pistol I'm clutching, this gun ain't for nothing
My mom know I'm evil so she call me Punken
Been fucked up, corrupted since I was a youngin'

Thirteen years old, got down with the set
Robbing niggas with the tech, my OG's smoking wet
You was running on the court, shooting shots at the net

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
I was only thirteen when a nigga tried to jack
I was trapping on a bike, it was for a twenty sack
Served the nigga through the gate, but I shouldn't done that
He only gave me two dollars, ran off with the sack
Nigga had me fucked up so I came right back
Every day on his block, posted in the cul-de-sac
Ran up on the nigga, shut him down, took his packs
Just pistol whip the nigga, I didn't even shoot the strap
Tall tee, du-rag, Astros fitted cap
I was fighting in school, every day I had SAC
Couple years went by, started busting off gats
Had to move to Fort Bend, didn't know how to act
Every day still came to the SWAT with the crips
With Lyndo and Lil Jordan, smoking dro, hitting licks
I was plotting every day for a scheme to get rich
Big Madu and Ali made this Kream Clicc shit

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Never switched up my clique, never switched up my crips
Every lick that we hit was quick cash just to flip
Doing petty ass shit on the dream to get rich
Now I'm moving them bills, came from just half a zip
Never trust a dumb bitch, don't put ass before chips
You get killed if you slip, keep that thing on your hip
Side talk from your lip, leave you dead in a ditch
Went from robbing for kicks, now we robbing for bricks
