[Verse 1]
I came in from the outside, burned out from a joy ride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is "Stella by Starlight"
That was my heart, the drums that start off "Night and Day"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Verse 2]
Tell me who, and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick
 'til every thought of 
it don't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Bridge]
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't, mmm
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know

[Verse 3]
The very thought of you and am I blue?
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh, the radio news reader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me awake and ask, 
"Is everything alright?"
And, Lord

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
