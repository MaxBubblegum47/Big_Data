[Verse 1]
Maybe you're too innocent
And I'm a crack in your glass
Watch me run down
Under your fingers
Maybe I'm indifferent, shut down
Oh, you know me all too well
All too well

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause no, I'm not an anthem
No I'm not your hope
No, I'm not an idea you decided was gold

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I'm a sinner
But I could be a saint in your head
No I don't got religion
But I'll tip my hat to the dead
No, you're not a season
Set to leave me in the cold
Still, I caught a sickness
That time you said I was, said I was yours

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm magnificently shut down
Take me to the water, watch me drown
Watch me drown
Cause I know I'm not innocent
But if you let me, I could show you how it feels
To be buried underground

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I'm a sinner
But I could be a saint in your head
No I don't got religion
But I'll tip my hat to the dead
No, you're not a season
Set to leave me in the cold
Still, I caught a sickness
That time you said I was, said I was yours

[Bridge]
'Cause no, I'm not an anthem
No, I'm not your hope
Not I'm not an idea you decided was gold
No, I'm not a season
Set to leave me in the cold
Still, I caught a sickness
That time you said I was yours

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I'm a sinner
But I could be a saint in your head
No I don't got religion
But I'll tip my hat to the dead
No, you're not a season
Set to leave me in the cold
Still, I caught a sickness
That time you said I was, said I was yours
