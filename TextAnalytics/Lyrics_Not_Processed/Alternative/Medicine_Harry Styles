Lyrics from live performances

[Verse 1]
I’m here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with you
Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on your fingertips
Up to your mouth, I’m feeling it out
I’m felling it out

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you tasted

[Chorus]
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
La la la la la
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh

[Verse 2]
Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are here
I mess around with him
And I'm okay with it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm coming down, I figured out I kinda like it
And when I sleep, I'm gonna dream of how you ride it

[Chorus]
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
La la la la la
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep, I’m gonna dream of how you tasted

[Chorus]
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
La la la la la
We're gettting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
