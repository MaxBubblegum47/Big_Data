[Verse 1]
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

[Pre-Chorus]
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time

[Chorus]
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

[Verse 2]
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

[Pre-Chorus]
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time

[Chorus]
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

[Bridge]
I want 'em back (I want 'em back)
The minds we had (The minds we had)
How all the thoughts (How all the thoughts)
Moved 'round our heads (Moved 'round our heads)
I want 'em back (I want 'em back)
The minds we had (The minds we had)
It's not enough to feel the lack
I want 'em back, I want 'em back, I want 'em

[Outro]
You're the only friend I need (You're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (Sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing till our ribs get tough (Laughing till our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (But that will never be enough)
You're the only friend I need (You're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (Sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing till our ribs get tough (Laughing till our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (But that will never be enough)
