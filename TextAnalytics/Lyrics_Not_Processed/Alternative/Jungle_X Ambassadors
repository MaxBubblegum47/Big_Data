Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Jamie N Commons and Sam Harris]
Well it's too long living in the same old lives (yeah)
I feel too cold to live, too young to die (yeah)
Will you walk the line, like it's there to choose? (oh)

[Refrain: Sam Harris]
Oh lord
Oh lord
I said oh lord

[Hook: Jamie N Commons and Sam Harris]
Won't you follow me into the jungle (yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (oh lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle (yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (oh lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle

[Verse 2: Jamie N Commons and Sam Harris]
I lost my mind, in the city of lights (yeah)
In the backstreets buildings and the neon lights (yeah)
When I heard the thunder, I could feel the rain (yeah)
It's the same to me, just a different name

[Refrain: Sam Harris]
Oh lord
Oh lord
I said oh lord

[Hook: Jamie N Commons and Sam Harris]
Won't you follow me into the jungle (yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (oh lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle (yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (oh lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle
