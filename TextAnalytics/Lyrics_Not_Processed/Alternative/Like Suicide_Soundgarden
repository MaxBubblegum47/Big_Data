Heard it from another room
Eyes were waking up just to fall asleep
Love's like suicide
Dazed out in a garden bed
With a broken neck lays my broken gift
Just like suicide

And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Lent to finish her
Finish her

She lived like a martyr
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a martyr
But she dies
Just like suicide

Bit down on the bullet now
I had a taste so sour
I had to think of something sweet
Love's like suicide
Safe outside my gilded cage
With an ounce of pain
I wield a ton of rage
Just like suicide

With eyes of blood
And bitter blue
How I feel for you
I feel for you

She lived like a martyr
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a martyr
But she died
Just like suicide

Hey yeah
Ohh
And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Yeah, lent to finish her
Finish her

With eyes of blood
And bitter blue
How I feel for you
I feel for you
I feel for you
I feel for you
I feel it
Oh, I feel for you

Hey

She lived like a martyr
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a martyr
But she died
Just like suicide
