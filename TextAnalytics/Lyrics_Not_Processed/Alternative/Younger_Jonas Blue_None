[Intro]
Oooh, oooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Someday, we'll be a million miles away
Waking up on Monday morning
Wishing it was Saturday
Kids screaming out, no warning
This will be a distant memory
I can hear the future calling, let it wait

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you know that we got time to get ourselves together
We got time for us
So baby, let's waste our time like we'll be young forever
Stay forever young
When we were 17, feels like just yesterday
Living a lucid dream, those years just fall away
One day we'll be 33 before we're old and gray
Let's still be 17 like yesterday

[Chorus]
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together

[Verse 2]
Always, you'll always be my fantasy
Even when we're grown up, know that I love you better than today
One day we'll be dancing slowly, but for now I'll make it rain
I can see the future calling, let it wait

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you know that we got time to get ourselves together
We got time for us
So baby, let's waste our time like we'll be young forever
Stay forever young
When we were 17, feels like just yesterday
Living a lucid dream, those years just fall away
One day we'll be 33 before we're old and gray
Let's still be 17 like yesterday

[Chorus]
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
