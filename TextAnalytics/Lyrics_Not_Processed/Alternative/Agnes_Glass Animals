[Verse 1]
Agnes, just stop and think a minute
Why don't you light that cigarette and
Calm down now, stop and breathe a second?
Go back to the very beginning
Can't you see what was different then?
You were just popping Percocet
Maybe just four a week at best
Maybe a smoke to clear the head

[Pre-Chorus]
Your head is so numb, that nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions, that trembling tender little sigh
And so it goes,
 
a choking rose back
To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine

[Verse 2]
You see the sad in everything
A genius of love and loneliness and
This time, you overdid the liquor
This time, you pulled the fucking trigger
These days, you're rolling all the time
So low, so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine?
Where went that billion-dollar smile?

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess life is long when soaked in sadness
On borrowed time
 
from Mister Madness
And so it goes,
 
a choking rose back
To be reborn
, I want to hold you like you're mine

[Chorus]
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
