[Intro]
Blueface, baby
Laudiano
Yeah, aight
When I was down, I had to hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told

[Chorus]
When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close
When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close

[Verse 1]
Niggas lookin' up to me like I made it
I was down, you ain't care, now I'm up and they hate it
I hate waitin', but I had to be patient
Anything I did, I had to be the greatest
Only one Blueface 'cause I'm never changin'
When you make it, everybody start to fake it
You wouldn't understand 'less we could switch places
But I ain't trippin', these Balenciagas ain't got no laces
Hate niggas, my Glock racist
Defender workin' with the same nigga judgin' my cases
Went to jail twice, beat both them felonies
They found large amounts but couldn't prove I was sellin' it
Midtown patriot like I'm Bill Belichick
If you don't want smoke, dumb nigga, then stop inhalin' it
(Stop inhalin' it)
(Broke boy, you don't want no smoke)

[Chorus]
When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close
When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close

[Verse 2]
Lifestyle expensive
Premium in my Benzes
I tote Glock with extensions
I like a bitch with extensions
Broke boy, don't come up missin' over a mention
I'm just tryna drip in high fashion in a mansion
But I'm never too popular to pop at ya
That .40 go "bang," but the MAC go "grra-ta-ta"
I leave more shots than ticket sales
Leave more shells than Taco Bell
Tote everywhere, I can make bail
Free the mob out them jail cells
Gotta keep a Glock on me like a lunch pail

[Chorus]
When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close
When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close

[Verse 3]
Yeah, aight, five bands just to get up close
I'm up close, I been livin' fast, lil' baby, suck slow
I was down 'til I got up in the studio
Hop in the booth, then I let the truth be known
Gotta keep the heat just in case it get too cold
Niggas want smoke 'til it's sparkin' out the .40 nose
Now all these bitches want me like I'm Mike Jones
I'm like a man smokin' at a gas station, I'm finna blow
Niggas want beef 'til I heat the shells for tacos
Just 'cause I put my meat in her cheese, I'm still not yours
You was late, I was on time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You wasn't here from the start
You can't get nothin' from Finish Line
I'm selfish, niggas can't have none 'til I finish mine

[Chorus]
When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close
When I was down, I hit the studio
Hop in the booth and let the truth be told
Not a stripper but I gotta keep a pole
They gotta pay me now just to get up close
