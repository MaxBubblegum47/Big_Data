Yuh, got 'em
Sus, runnin'
Fuck, got 'em
Look, spotted
Yuh, got 'em
Sus, runnin'
Fuck, got 'em
Look, spotted

[Verse 1]
You're taking my heart, now
They're taking my heart, now
And I don't know why (Come)
And I don't know why (Come, come with me)
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
The demons told me everything
They whisper in the night
 (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus]
This is not a threat, I promise (Nope)
I promise
This is not a threat, I promise
It's a warning, baby, I just want you to know

[Verse 2]
That was when the ceiling caved in
When I'm falling in a trench, I'm behaving (Skrrt)
I'm behaving myself
 (Uh)
I'm behaving myself
 (Look, look, what, what)
We don't gotta die so soon
So I just behave for you, for you, for you
We don't gotta die so soon
So I just behave forâ€“(Shh, quiet)

[Chorus]
This is not a threat, I promise (Nope)
I promise
This is not a threat, I promise (Yuh, yuh, yuh)
It's a warning, baby, I just want you to know

[Outro]
Please, just let me go
Let me go, I've seen enough
I've seen enough
I've seen enough
(That sounds good)
