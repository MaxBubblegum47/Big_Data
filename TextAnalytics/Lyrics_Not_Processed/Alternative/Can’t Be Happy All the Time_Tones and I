[Verse 1]
As I fall asleep now
I think of all the paths I've taken
That lead me back to here
And I wonder, is life at its peak now?
Is it stuck in first gear?
When will it all disappear?

[Pre-Chorus]
And time keeps passing by
But I'm too busy to reply
And as I close my eyes
I say that I won't go tonight
I'm looking for a sign
My only friends have been online
And as I close my eyes
I tell myself I'm fine

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna cry
But now it's hard to breathe
And now everybody's standing here
But no one seems to know me
And I'm alright
Tomorrow, I'll be fine
'Cause you can't be happy
You can't be happy all the time
You can't be happy all the time
You can't be happy all the time

[Verse 2]
As I walk through the streets now
I realise I don't know where I'm going
I don't know why I'm here
And if I live just to please without showing
Do I lose myself here?
Am I living by fear?

[Pre-Chorus]
And time keeps passing by
But I'm too busy to reply
And as I close my eyes
I say that I won't go tonight
I'm looking for a sign
My only friends have been online
And as I close my eyes
I tell myself I'm fine

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna cry
But now it's hard to breathe
And now everybody's standing here
But no one seems to know me
And I'm alright
Tomorrow, I'll be fine
'Cause you can't be happy
You can't be happy all the time
You can't be happy all the time
You can't be happy all the time
