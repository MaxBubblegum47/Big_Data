Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Hello father, what you know about me?
Do you know who you are?
Do you know everything?
Hello father, what you know about me?
Do you know who you are?
Do you know everything?
Sometimes I think I got it all, all, all
Sometimes I think I got it all, all, all, all

[Build: Kevin Abstract]
Los Angeles, you've been too good to me
Los Angeles, you've been too good to me
A mismatch filled, but LA's good to me
Place I call my home, that's history
Los Angeles, you've been to good to me
Los Angeles, you've been to good to me
A mismatch filled, but LA's good to me
Place I call my home, that's history

[Drop: Kevin Abstract]
I wanna kiss a man on the moon
And I just gotta say, out of everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you
I wanna kiss a man on the moon
And I just wanna say, out of everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you
