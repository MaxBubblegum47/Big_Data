[Chorus: BENEE]
I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mmh, ah, yeah

[Verse 1: BENEE]
Water pouring down from the ceiling
I knew this would happen, still hard to believe it
Maybe I'm dramatic, I don't wanna seem it
I don't wanna panic

[Pre-Chorus: BENEE]
I'm a sad girl in this big world, it's a mad world
All of my friends know what's happened, you're a bad thing (Ah)

[Chorus: BENEE]
I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mmh, ah, yeah

[Post-Chorus: BENEE]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (Super lonely)

[Verse 2: BENEE & Gus Dapperton]
Now I'm in the bathtub cryin'
Think I'm slowly sinking
Bubbles in my eyes now
Maybe I'm just dreamin'
Now I'm in the sad club
Just tryna get a back rub (Lonely)

[Pre-Chorus: BENEE with Gus Dapperton]
I'm a sad girl in this big world, it's a mad world
All of my friends know what's happened, you're a bad thing

[Chorus: BENEE]
I know I fucked up (Fucked up), I'm just a loser (Loser)
Shouldn't be with ya (With ya), guess I'm a quitter (Quitter)
While you're out there drinkin' (Drinkin'), I'm just here thinkin' (Thinkin')
'Bout where I should've been (Where I should've been)
I've been lonely, mmh, ah, yeah (Woah)

[Post-Chorus: BENEE]
La-la-la-la (Woo), la-la-la-la
Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (Super lonely)

[Bridge: Gus Dapperton]
I loathe romancing in itself, yeah, I'd be damned to try
I'm only dancin' by myself, so I don't slam my Irish buck
Compostable cups, B-B-BENEE, I can't stress this enough
I would hate to mess things up, but my boogie still stays restless as fuck, yeah

[Chorus: BENEE & Gus Dapperton, BENEE]
I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mmh, ah, yeah

[Post-Chorus: BENEE]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (Super lonely)

[Outro: BENEE]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (I've been lonely, I've been lonely)
Lonely (I've been lonely, by the way)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (I've been lonely)
