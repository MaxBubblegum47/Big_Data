[Verse 1]
A gardener told me some plants move
But I could not believe it
'Til me and Hannah Hunt
Saw crawling vines and weeping willows
As we made our way from Providence to Phoenix

[Verse 2]
A man of faith said hidden eyes
Could see what I was thinking
I just smiled and told him
That was only true of Hannah
And we glided on through Waverly and Lincoln

[Chorus]
Our days were long, our nights no longer
Count the seconds, watching hours
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

[Verse 3]
In Santa Barbara, Hannah cried
"I miss those freezing beaches"
And I walked into town
To buy some kindling for the fire
Hannah tore the New York Times up into pieces

[Chorus]
If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If I can't trust you then damn it, Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time
