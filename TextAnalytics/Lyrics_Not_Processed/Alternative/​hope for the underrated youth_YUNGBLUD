[Verse 1]
If I left today, would you wait for me
Or would you throw us all away like the magazines say?
Should I go right away? Cut all of my hair off
And change my second name from a juvenile state?

[Pre-Chorus]
And just take my heart out, that'll make it better
I won't be sorry, better late than never
Just take my heart out, that'll make it better
Hidin' all my feelings, but I know that I'm not dreaming

[Chorus]
'Cause there's hope for the underrated youth
And I'm so far from telling you the truth
'Cause you keep on pulling me down, pulling me down, pulling me down
Yeah, there's hope for the underrated youth

[Verse 2]
Every day is an episode, I pick and mix my self-control
My head won't let me go, like if I died, you'd never know
I made friends with the dark parts that are inside of my mind
I tie them up till they come up, spiking juvenile rhymes
And my eyes are about to blow, but that's all part of this freak show
My personality got fucked up by the Adderall
Got called an alien for bein' myself
I ain't got the patience to be someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
So just take my heart out, that'll make it better
I won't be sorry, better late than never
Just take my heart out, that'll make it better
Hidin' all my feelings, but I know that I'm not dreaming

[Chorus]
'Cause there's hope for the underrated youth
And I'm so far from telling you the truth
'Cause you keep on pulling me down, pulling me down, pulling me down
Yeah, there's hope for the underrated youth

[Bridge]
If I die, would you cry?
Or would you come and bury me alive?
If I die, would you cry?
Or would you come and bury me alive?
If I die, would you cry?
Or would you come and bury me alive?
If I die, would you cry?
Would you come and bury me alive?
(Would you come and bury me alive?)

[Chorus]
There's hope for the underrated youth
I'm so far from telling you the truth
Yeah, there's hope for the underrated youth
And I'm so far from telling you the truth
You keep on pulling me down, pulling me down, pulling me down
Yeah, there's hope for the underrated youth
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
