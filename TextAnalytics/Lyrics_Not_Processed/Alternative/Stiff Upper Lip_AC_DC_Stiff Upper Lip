[Intro]
Well, I was out on a drive, on a bit of a trip
Looking for thrills to get me some kicks
Now, I warn you ladies, I shoot from the hip
I was born with a stiff - stiff upper lip

[Verse 1]
Like a dog and I howl
I bite everything
And I'm big and I know
And I'll ball your thing

[Chorus]
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot, and I shoot
Shoot from the hip
Yeah, I shoot from the hip

Now listen

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm working it out
And I've done everything, yeah
And I can't reform, no
Can you feel my sting?

[Chorus]
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot, and I shoot
Shoot from the hip
Yeah, I shoot from the hip

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm out on the prowl
And I'll ball your thing
I got the teeth that'll bite you
Can you feel that sting?

[Chorus]
Babe, I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot, shoot
Shoot from the hip

[Bridge]
I got a (stiff upper lip)
Better believe me (stiff upper lip)
Coming down (stiff upper lip)
See my (stiff upper lip)
Yeah, I got a (stiff upper lip)
Stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
I got a stiff upper lip
I got a stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
And I shoot
And I shoot
And I shoot
Shoot from the hip
