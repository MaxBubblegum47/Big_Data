[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
To know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
Just to see her smile
Makes my life worthwhile
Yes, just to know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
And I do
And I do
And I do

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I'll be good to her
I'll make love to her
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I walk alongside of her

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Yes, just to know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
And I do
And I do
And I do

[Refrain: John Lennon]
Why can't she see?
How blind can she be?
Someday she'll see
That she was meant just for me, oh, oh

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
To know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
Just to see her smile
Makes my life worthwhile
Yes, just to know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
And I do
And I do
And I do

[Refrain: John Lennon]
Why can't she see?
How blind can she be?
Someday she'll see
That she was meant just for me, oh, oh

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
To know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
Just to see her smile
Makes my life worthwhile
Yes, just to know, know, know her
Is to love, love, love her
And I do
And I do
And I do
