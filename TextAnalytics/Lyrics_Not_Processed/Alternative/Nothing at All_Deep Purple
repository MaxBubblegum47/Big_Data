[Verse 1]
I'm talking to myself again
And waving to a passing friend
I've know her since I don't know when
Ah, it's nothing at all
Just the few of us walk arm in arm
It's innocent and charming
But the children seem to be getting alarmed
Don't worry kids, it's nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus]
When I hear about the doom and gloom
That's around the corner and coming soon
I take a sip of mother's ruin
And sit with my back to the wall

[Chorus 1]
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
And the old lady smiled
It's nothing at all
Then she blew all the leaves off my tree

[Verse 2]
And the junk that sails our seven seas
Is very nearly up to my knees
But the platitudes and pleasantries
Keep saying it's nothing at all
I'll deal with it on another day
If I close my eyes it'll go away
So bottoms up, boys, and what do you say?
Really, it's nothing at all

[Chorus 2]
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
And the old lady smiled
It's nothing at all
And the summer passed away

[Chorus 3]
Nothing at all
It's nothing at all
And the old lady smiled
It was nothing at all
Then she blew all the leaves off my tree
