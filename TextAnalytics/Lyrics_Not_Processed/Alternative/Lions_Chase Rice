[Intro: The Lord's Prayer]
Our Father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy Name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On Earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power, and the glory
For ever and ever. Amen

[Verse 1]
Ain't no cage that can hold us
Ain't no hate that can fold us
Put on the chains and we'll break 'em
They want a battle we'll take 'em
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
They can't keep us on a leash

[Chorus]
The kings of our little towns
If there's a rebel around, you know it's gonna be one of us
We're right at home in the wild
Can't help it, that's our style
Born and bred to be dangerous
We might roll on a Saturday night
Get that look in our eyes and we're striking like lightning
Some may say we're too loud, some may say we're too proud
Well, there's lambs and there's lions

[Post-Chorus]
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions

[Verse 2]
Our heads are down with our eyes up
Just like the sun, yeah, we'll rise up
Better think twice 'fore you size up
A second thought, yeah, you'll wise up

[Chorus]
The kings of our little towns
If there's a rebel around, you know it's gonna be one of us
We're right at home in the wild
Can't help it, that's our style
Born and bred to be dangerous
We might roll on a Saturday night
Get that look in our eyes and we're striking like lightning
Some may say we're too loud, some may say we're too proud
Well, there's lambs and there's lions

[Post-Chorus]
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions

[Bridge]
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
They can't keep us on a leash
Which one are you gonna be?

[Chorus]
The kings of our little towns
If there's a rebel around, you know it's gonna be one of us
We're right at home in the wild
Can't help it, that's our style
Born and bred to be dangerous
We might roll on a Saturday night
Get that look in our eyes and we're striking like lightning
Some may say we're too loud, some may say we're too proud
Well, there's lambs and there's lions

[Outro]
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions
We are lions, we are lions
