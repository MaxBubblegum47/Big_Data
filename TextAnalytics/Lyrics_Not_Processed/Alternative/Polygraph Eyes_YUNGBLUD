[Verse 1]
She leaves her parents house around midnight
Meets her best mate at the shop, buy some cheap wine
And go to space, see the Milky Way
Get away from the teenage everyday clich√© pressure
Absent on absinthe, dancing to bad synths
Saturday night ain't about romancing anymore
Just you getting lit in the queue to the dance floor

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too many blokes are getting heavy
When a girl looks unsteady
Blisters on your bleeding soles
"Here have my boots, I'll walk you home"
He walks her straight up to the front door
As she stumbles on the floor
We all know what happens next
A bit of fun turns to regret

[Chorus]
Leave it alone, mate
She doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no
Leave it alone, mate
She doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya
Leave it alone, mate
She doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no
Leave it alone, mate, leave it alone, mate, leave it alone, mate

[Verse 2]
Daylight wakes her up the next morning
A foreign room where the sheets are blue, and not white
No scented candles in sight
Just a stranger on his side, says, "Cheers, love, for last night"
Got to go forensic, avoid the domestic
Get antiseptic and give him the polygraph eyes
Turn your head to the side and lie to the real life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See this girl, she had a boyfriend
His name was Zack and he made her happy
But he couldn't understand
In his mind, she was a slag
When she tried to explain what happened
She was shouting at him for an hour
Crying at the top of her lungs
"Don't leave me here, you're the one I love"

[Chorus]
Leave it alone, mate
She doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no
Leave it alone, mate
She doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya
Leave it alone, mate
She doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no
Leave it alone, mate
She doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya

[Bridge]
She can't even run, she can't even walk
She slurs when she speaks
But you hear what you want when she can't even talk
She can't even run, she can't even walk
She slurs when she speaks
But you hear what you want when she can't even talk
Can't even talk, can't even talk
(Can't even talk, can't even talk)

[Chorus]
Leave it alone, mate
She doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no
Leave it alone, mate
She doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya
Leave it alone, mate
She doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no
Leave it alone, mate
She doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya

[Outro]
(Leave it alone, mate) She can't even run
(Leave it alone, mate) She can't even walk
She slurs when she speaks
But you hear what you want when she can't even talk
(Leave it alone, mate) She can't even run
(Leave it alone, mate) She can't even walk
She slurs when she speaks
But you hear what you want when she can't even talk
