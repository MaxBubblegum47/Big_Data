[Verse 1]
When I'm looking at myself
I see a thousand perspectives of me
Everyone is letting me show
A side of myself I can't see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm wide awake now, I'm free of the doubt
Don't wanna look down
And if I fall out, I lay on the ground
And look to the clouds

[Chorus]
It's like I got brand new eyes, and I can finally see
What has always been right there in front of me
And with these brand new eyes I'll take in everything
And I will finally see me

[Post-Chorus]
I can finally see
I can finally see it
I can finally see
I can finally see it

[Verse 2]
Couldn't let the world decide
All of the things that I can or can't do
What if I had taken all the things
That broke me and made them my truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm wide awake now, I'm free of the doubt
Don't wanna look down
And if I fall out, I lay on the ground
And look to the clouds

[Chorus]
It's like I got brand new eyes, and I can finally see
What has always been right there in front of me
And with these brand new eyes I'll take in everything
And I will finally see me

[Post-Chorus]
I can finally see
I can finally see it
I can finally see
I can finally see it

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
