[Intro]
First the mother fuckin [?] got mo' business coming to the God damn hood
Bitch, I'ma tell you one fuckin' thang, 'Better get the fuck outta my face before I slap the dog shit out yo ass'

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
One hunnid carats in my hood, four million bitches on my mind
One hunnid carats in that hood, four million bitches on my mind
One hunnid carats in my hood, four million bitches on my mind
One hunnid carats in that hood, four million bitches on my mind

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Put the motherfuckin' gun in your mouth and when the motherfucker kick in the door
And I'mma be up in there, he said I'll see you in hell, probably when I'm gettin' out
I got a killer up there but I ain't running my mouth, I got it
Two shots, popped it on [?]
Bu-bop, six on dice, drop it
I got, [?]
He bop, yeah, nigga, buck stop it
Rollin' 'round with a pound of weed, I got it
E'rybody on the team gotta full locket
E'rybody gotta beam on a nigga pocket
Lean back, nigga, fuck that, we got this
Gotta get it gotta get it gotta goooo (get it)
No strippers in the club they be show wit' it
More strippers in the club when we roll in it
Order me a double, a gold digger and break every penny I got it for-for
Seen everybody, I gotta-gotta get more-more
Get out the middle when niggas [?] they let go-go-go-go-go-go
Shotgun, still gon' blow
Shotgun, still gon' blow
Shotgun, still gon' blow

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
One hunnid carats in my hood, four million bitches on my mind
One hunnid carats in that hood, four million bitches on my mind
One hunnid carats in my hood, four million bitches on my mind
One hunnid carats in that hood, four million bitches on my mind

[Verse 2: Flesh-N-Bone]
Who is that steppin' in the buildin' lookin' like diamonds
You cheatin' on, we livin' life grimey
Holla back if you wanna get that, split that, kick back
Gotta nigga tryna hit that
Niggas know where they can find me, chillin' at the trap spot
I'm tryna make a mutha fuckin' mill, hunnid dollar bills
Gotta nigga pockets on fill, homies tryna come up on a kill
Who-Who, can tell me what the deal is?
Anybody fucking with stacks
I pack steel in my backpack, then the [?], pap pap
I don't think a nigga really wanna handle that
Chit-chat, nigga, that's where the birds at
And, man, I don't wanna hear anybody chirpin'

[?], never not mine is a nickel and a dime [?]

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
One hunnid carats in my hood, four million bitches on my mind
One hunnid carats in that hood, four million bitches on my mind
One hunnid carats in my hood, four million bitches on my mind
One hunnid carats in that hood, four million bitches on my mind
