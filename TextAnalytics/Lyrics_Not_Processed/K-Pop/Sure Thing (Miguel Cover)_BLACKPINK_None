[Intro: Jennie]
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
Oh-ooh-whoa
Oh-ooh-whoa
Oh-ooh-whoa

[Refrain: Lisa & Jennie]
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that (Oh-ooh-whoa, whoa-oh)
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that (Yeah, yeah)
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that, that, that

[Verse 1: Rosé; Jennie; Jennie & Jisoo; All]
If you'd be the cash, I'd be the rubber-band
You'd be the match, I'ma be the fuse, boom
Painter, baby, you could be the muse
I'm the reporter, baby, you could be the news
'Cause you're a cigarette and I'm a smoker
We raise a bet and you're the joker, truth told
You are the chalk and I could be the blackboard
And you could be the talk and I could be the walk

[Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé; both]
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hands in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing

[Refrain: Lisa & Jennie]
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that, that, that

[Verse 2: Jisoo; Jisoo & Rosé; Jennie & Lisa]
You could be the lover, I'll be the fighter, babe
If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter, babe, fire it up
Writer, baby, you could be the quote
If I'm the lyric, baby, you could be the note, record that

[Verse 3: Jennie & Lisa; Jennie; Jennie & Jisoo; Rosé]
Saint, I'm a sinner
Prize, I'm a winner
And it's you, what can I do to deserve that?
Paper, baby, I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one
'Cause you are a ten
It's real, not pretend, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Jisoo, Lisa & Rosé; All]
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine (Oh-oh-oh)
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hands in mine
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that)
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that)
Even when it's do or die
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that, that)
We can do it, baby, simple and plain (20 feet fall)
'Cause this love is a sure thing (Eh, eh)

[Bridge: Lisa & Jennie]
Rock with me, babe
Let me hold you in my arms
Talk to me, babe, eh
Yeah, rock with me, babe
Let me hold you in my arms
Talk to me, babe

[Verse 4: Jennie & Lisa; both]
I fall in love every single time, look into your eyes
Those eyes; they never lie
I can tell you're mine, it's so hard
When you're not around (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
I get mad thinking how I always can't have you around
I wanna make you spend the whole day with me, boy
Play me like a toy, I'm all yours to enjoy
Hoping this moment lasts long and forever
I got no fear whatsoever, you're my one and only lover, ay
Roll a dice, I bet it twice
Don't think I can live a life without
You in it, you can bet that
Never sweat that you know what I'm best at
Ready or not, I'm gonna have you by tonight
Ay, I call the shots, won't you be my kryptonite?

[Outro: All; Jennie]
Love you like a brother (Love you like a brother)
Treat you like a friend (Treat you like a friend)
Respect you like a lover
Oh-ooh-whoa
Oh-ooh-whoa
Oh-ooh-whoa
