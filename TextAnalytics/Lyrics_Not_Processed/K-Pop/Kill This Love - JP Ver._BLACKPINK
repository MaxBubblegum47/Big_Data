[ブラックピンク 「Kill This Love - JP Ver.」 歌詞]

[Intro: Jennie & 
Lisa
]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
BLACKPINK in your area!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jennie]
天使がsaid "Hi"
結果　悪魔 said "Bye"
正気じゃ無理 So high
吐いちゃうくらいの Price
答えのないTest
騙されても Yes
ずっと感情の奴隷
無価値な愛ね

[Verse 2: Lisa]
Here I come kickin' the door, uh
Act like I'm buyin' the store, uh
You better gimme some love, love
Bitch, fill it up, gimme some more
Feelin' like I think that I need to pray
But you need it more, lord, give me the strength
'Cause I'm at my limit and in just one minute
You're gonna be visiting heaven, but
You might not get in it

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & 
Rosé
]
Look at me, look at you
苦しい？どっちが you smart
誰？ You are
両目 涙 赤にしたら so sorry
誰？ You are
どうして　泣かないようにしても
いっそのこと目を伏せ
この愛　トドメ刺すきっと

[Chorus: All, 
Lisa
 & 
Jennie
]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Verse 3: Jennie & 
Lisa
]
Feelin' like a sinner
It's so fire with him, I go boo-hoo
He said "You look crazy"
Thank you, baby
I owe it all to you
Got me all messed up
His love is my favorite
But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & 
Jisoo
]
Lucky me, lucky you
狂言の中 we lie
So what, so what?
まして君を除外したら so sorry
I'm not sorry
どうして　泣かないようにしても...
いっそのこと目を伏せ
この愛　トドメ刺すきっと

[Chorus: All, 
Lisa
 & 
Jennie
]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Bridge: Rosé]
We all commit to love
That makes you cry, oh-oh
We're all making love
That kills you inside, yeah

[Outro: All]
We must kill this love (Yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah, yeah!)
Before it kills you too
Kill this love (Yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love, gotta kill
Let's kill this love
