[ブラックピンク 「Last Christmas ~ Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer (BLACKPINK ARENA TOUR 2018 "SPECIAL FINAL IN KYOCERA DOME OSAKA")」 歌詞]

[Intro: Jennie & 
Jisoo
]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 1: Rosé]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

[Chorus: Lisa, 
Rosé
 & 
Jisoo
]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart 
(I gave you my heart)
But the very next day, you gave it away 
(You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 2: BLACKPINK]
まっかなお鼻の　トナカイさんは
いつも　みんなの笑いもの
でも　その年の　クリスマスの日
サンタのおじさんは　いいました

[Refrain: Rosé & Lisa, 
Jisoo & Jennie
, 
All
]
くらい夜道は　ピカピカの
おまえの鼻が　やくにたつのさ
いつもないてた　トナカイさんは
こよいこそはと
　よろこびました
よろこびました
