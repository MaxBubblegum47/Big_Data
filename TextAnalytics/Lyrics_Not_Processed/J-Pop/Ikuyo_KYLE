When I asked niggas for help, yo, I got none (No, ha)
When I did this shit myself's when it got done (Yes)

[Verse 1: KYLE]
Yeah, woah (Woah), I did it on my solo
'Member I was so low, no one wanted photos (Yeah)
Now I'm on the big screen (Huh), used to eat at Wendy's (Yeah)
Got rich overnight, it's like I married Mrs. Winfrey, woah (Uh)
And now I'm doin' shows (Yeah), and I brought all my bros (Yeah)
And I got all these powers (Huh), I'll vanquish all my foes (Wow)
I used to borrow clothes (Yeah), I never borrow flows (What?)
Nigga, I got a girl (Yeah), don't need to borrow hoes (Yo)
I mean y'all niggas gross (Ew), I keep my circle close (Yeah)
I like myself enough (Ooh), that's why I barely post (Yup)
Ooh-ooh, you niggas funny, go get you some money
All these niggas cryin', go get you some Huggies, haha
'Cause I look like a couple M's (Damn)
My paycheck only had a couple cents (Damn)
Back then, I only had a couple friends (Guess what?)
(Bitch) I still got a couple friends (Yeah), haha

[Chorus: KYLE & 2 Chainz]
(Uh) I think we got one (Got it) (Ya)
I put the team up on my back like I'm Marshawn (Marshawn Lynch)

When I did this shit myself's when it got done (Yes) (2 Chainz)
Yeah, woah (Woah)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz & KYLE]
Thawed off with the top down
High speed like the cop's 'round (Huh)
Dick tall, made her climb up
Then after that, make her hop down (Down)
Draymond with the lockdown (Yeah)
Look at my birth pictures
Had an AR in the background (Bah, bah)
Tell the squares I'm back 'round (Yeah)
Black out, won't back down
Sak 'round, walk in, no pat down, then sat down (No)
If I'm here, my strap 'round, my girl brown, her tongue wild
Gun pow, shoot 'til I run out (What? What? Oh)
Brighter than a sunflower, rolled a joint that last one hour
All I need is one mic, I got stripes like an umpire
Hotter than a brush fire (Ooh)
Drench God, Drench Messiah
Up David, I can get higher, up late, I don't get tired
Seen me on 6'5", stood on a quarter milli'
That made me 6'9", that made you itty-bitty
I like when she independent 'cause when I try to buy her shit
She say she don't need it, ha, cool with me (Yeah)
