[Intro: Big Sean]
I do it, boii
I do it, Tinie
But all these bad bitches knew it
Its B-I-G man
Hey Tinie, we gotta let 'em know man
From D-Town and the Uk
We got a hundred pounds, a hundred thousand pounds, a hundred thousand million, to fuck shit up
I can probably buy your bitch nigga
Nigga fuck your bitch nigga

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Please don’t tell the bishop I’ve been sipping on some sizzurp
Got a dirty chick named Liz who use her tongue just like a lizard
I don’t even know the difference between Halloween and Christmas
I’m Jo Rowlings Harry Potter, I’ma motherfucking wizard, ha
Reporting to you live via satellite
Or in a sex tape with a girl who say she camera shy
Helen Bonham Carter, man, these bitches ain't acting right
You niggas dicks and pussies, hermaphrodites
Been partying for 4 weeks, hope them papers never saw me
Hundred thousand dollar whip but still nobody will ensure me
Having orgies and of course bitches tryna Jersey Shore me
I ain't leavin’ Las Vegas, you gon’ have to come deport me
Ha, rum-pum-pa-pum, we at the Bacardi table
A couple girls of live coke, we call em Charlie’s angels
December, January, February, March and April
Disturbing London baby, fuck them other nasty labels
Hickory, dickory I just had an epiphany
Why’d I call myself Tinie, if I keep thinking about bigamy
They put me in rehab, I’ma go jail for polygamy
Ding dong special delivery
This a moment in history

News just in, another number 1
Ask the club for 20 bottles and a couple blunts
Hallowed be thy name, thy Kingdom come
I’m a muthaf-ckin lucky (boiii)
I’m a muthaf-ckin lucky (boiii)
Look at the muthaf-ckin lucky (whoa)
Hallowed be thy name, thy Kingdom come
I’m a muthaf-ckin lucky (boiii)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Don’t fuck a man when I pass by
I’m pass high, that Tinie shit, might pass out
I p-p-p-ick that money up then dash out, condo bigger than your dad's house
Holding big ass bags of weed, look like I’m finna' take the trash out
Head so good I don’t need to fuck
20 fucking bottles I don’t need a cup
Looking like I’m bar tending, chilling somewhere thats off limits
VIP I’m all in it, me and my crew was all winning
20 cars thats all tinted, vroom, vroom, that shit calls bitches
Hoes jumping for my balls
Man,the ref just might call goaltending
Boi, bitch I do my thang
Got all these bad bitches trynna do my thing
I made a promise that I’m never going broke
Fuck a rainy day, I ain't never gonna soak
Watch me take a little bit then flip it into mo’
Niggas flippin’ out tryna touch the shit
Then I turn your ass to a ghost
Rolex is my ticker, I’m off that liquor than lick her
Her panties slippin’ and sliding, I’m in that pussy no wiskers
Oh thats your girl, my bad my nigga, come get her
She probably answering the door, wearing my slippers
Boii I do it
