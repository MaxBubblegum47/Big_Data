[Verse 1]
Been in town, my baby, we just got to rock on
Yeah, darling, we just got to go home
I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on, baby, just rock, rock, rock

[Verse 2]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, honey
We've been shaking all night
Oh, darling, we just got to roll right
Aaah, ooh, my head, rock on, rock on

[Bridge]
Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe

[Outro]
I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on baby, just rock, rock, rock
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Oohoo oohoo oohoo oohoo oohoo
Let's go out
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on baby, just rock, rock, yeah

[Laughter]
