[Verse 1]
Her face is cracked from smiling, all the fears that she's been hiding
And she wonders pretty soon everybody's gonna know
And her voice is sore from shouting, cheering winners who are losing
And she wonders if their days are few and soon they'll have to go

[Chorus]
My, my, I'm so happy, I'm gonna join the band
We're gonna sing and dance in celebration
We're in the promised land

[Verse 2]
She hears them talk of new ways to protect the home she lives in
She wonders what it's all about when they break down the door
Her name is Brown, White or Black, you know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy as the winners toll the bell

[Chorus]
My, my, I'm so happy, I'm gonna join the band
We're gonna dance and sing in celebration
We're in the promised land

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
There is a train station heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more
And if you walk you're gonna get there though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance you will wring your hands and moan

[Outro]
Oh Yeah
You're gonna moan, you're gonna moan
Hear me, you'll moan

[Guitar Solo]
