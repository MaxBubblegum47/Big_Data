[Verse 1]
Put your foot to the floor
Don't need no more
You been kickin' around
While you're messin' about

[Pre-Chorus]
Better catch her name
Come on in
Give me that thing
That thing gone wild

[Chorus]
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)

[Verse 2]
Make a stand, show your hand
Call in a high command
Don't think, just obey
I'm like a bird of prey

[Pre-Chorus]
Better catch her name
Come on in
Give me that thing
That thing gone wild

[Chorus]
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)

[Bridge]
Better watch your back
And cover your tracks
Kick your foot through the door
Hit the deck, know the score
They're taken by surprise
And here's mud in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Misery's the name if you shoot 'em for gain
Call of the wild
Hurry for naught
That thing gone wild

[Chorus]
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
Let's go

[Guitar Solo]
That thing gone wild

[Chorus]
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
