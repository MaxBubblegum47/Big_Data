[Part I]

[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
You are the reason
The reason I sing
I have to preserve you
'Cause you're my everything
Babe, I know I fucked up
Fucked with some empty cups
But you got your friends too
Better believe in it
Truth I'm up on my luck
Can't stop runnin' amok
But you got your friends too

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
I just want to thank you for savin' my life, yes
I just want to thank you for all your advice

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
You are the reason (
Ooh
), the reason I'm alive
I must bring you honor (
Honor
)
If I don't, I'll die
Ma', I know I brought shame (Ma', I know I brought shame)
Put a mark on your name (Put a mark on your name)
But you got your thangs too (You got your thangs too)
Better believe it, I'm (You got your thangs too)
Risin' up from the flames (Risin' up from the flames)
The phoenix that I became (The phoenix that I became)
But you got your thangs too (You got your thangs)
Oh, help me sing

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & Choir]
I just want to thank you for givin' me life, yes
I just want to thank you for all your advice

[Bridge: Choir & Daniel Caesar]
Send me kisses when it's grey skies
Its been so long, look how time flies
If you love me, won't you let me know?
I've been tryna learn to let you go
Call my name whenever tears fall
When you face your fears, you'll stand tall, ohh, whoa
Send me kisses when it's grey skies
(Can't you see?)
Its been so long, look how time flies
(I'm spending all)
If you love me, won't you let me know?
(This time)
I've been tryna learn to let you go
Call my name whenever tears fall
(Come with me)
When you face your fears, you'll stand tall, ohh, whoa
(I hope we can)
(Rewind)

[Verse 3: Daniel Caesar]
Know I'd take a bullet for you
No, you don't know what I go through
And I know you think you're 
kind of nice
Do you remember when I saved your life?
Don't come at me on some weak shit
It's time you stopped displaying weakness, ohh, ohh

[Outro: Sean Leon]
Hey mama
It's your second son, still the same, ain't changed, mama
Made some change
Times have changed on me
Times have changed (Minds have changed)
And mine feels strange, mama
I feel ashamed (What could I say to you face to face with my fate, I lost my faith)
Face to face with my fate, mama, I lost my faith

[Silent Interlude]

[Part II]

[Verse: Daniel Caesar]
Isn't it nice?
Human sacrifice
The universe got it
I got too excited
And now we're taking life
Isn't it nice?
Human sacrifice
I hate consequences, that shit's too expensive
You keep chasing delight
Isn't it nice?
Human sacrifice
I take the easy way out every time
I don't deserve my own life
Isn't it nice?
Human sacrifice, oh yes
They say I'm a martyr
Charge that to my ego
I just want all the lights
