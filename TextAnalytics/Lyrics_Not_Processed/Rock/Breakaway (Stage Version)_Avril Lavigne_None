[Intro]
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
Grew up in a small town
When the rain would fall down
I'd just stare in my window
Dreaming of what could be
If I'd end up happy
So I'd pray
I could breakaway

[Chorus]
I'll spread my wings
And I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
Make a wish
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
Take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway

[Bridge]
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Baby I don't know where they'll take me
But I gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away

[Chorus]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Do what it takes till I touch the sky
Make a wish
Take a chance
Take a change
And breakaway
Breakaway

[Outro]
Breakaway
