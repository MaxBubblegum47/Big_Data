[Verse 1]
Those crazy nights, I do remember in my youth
I do recall, those were the best times, most of all
In the heat with a blue jean girl
Burning love comes once in a lifetime
She found me singing by the rail road tracks
Took me home, we danced by the moonlight

[Chorus]
Those summer nights are calling
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm falling
Stone in love

[Verse 2]
Old dusty roads, led to the river
Running slow
She pulled me down, ooh, and in clover
We'd go around, yeah
In the heat with a blue jean girl
Burning love comes once in a lifetime
Oh, the memories never fade away
Golden girl, I'll keep you forever

[Chorus]
Those summer nights are calling
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm falling
Stone in love

[Chorus]
Those summer nights are calling
Stone in love
Can't help myself, I'm falling
Stone in love

[Outro]
(Stone in love)
Stone in love
Stone in love
Stone in love
Stone in love
