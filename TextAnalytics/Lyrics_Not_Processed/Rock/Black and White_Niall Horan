[Verse 1]
That first night, we were standin' at your door
Fumblin' for your keys, then I kissed you
Ask me if I wanna come inside
'Cause we didn't wanna end the night
Then you took my hand and I followed you

[Chorus]
Yeah, I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
Now we're sittin' here in your livin' room
Tellin' stories while we share a drink or two
And there's a vision I've been holdin' in my mind
We're sixty-five and you ask
When did I first know, I always knew

[Chorus]
And I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
And I want the world to witness when we finally say "I do"
It's the way you love, I gotta give it back to you
I can't promise picket fences or sunny afternoons
But at night, when I close my eyes

[Chorus]
I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you
I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another (Never be)
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

[Outro]
And there'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
