[Intro: Jorja Smith]
No one sees
No one-
One-
No one sees
No one sees
No one sees
No one-
One-
No one sees
No one-
(Conducta)

[Pre-Chorus: Jorja Smith]
No one knows the pain
No one sees what I see in you
No one feels the same
No one sees myself like you do

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
Yo, it's the hyperman set
AJ Tracey, live and direct
DJ mash up the, mash up the deck
The microphone champ is live and direct
And again, it’s the hyperman set (Yeah)
AJ Tracey, live and direct (Who?)
DJ mash up the, mash up the deck
The microphone champ is live and direct
I said bubble, vibes and that (Vibes)
Cruise like a four-wheel drive and that
Tek time, everyting's live and that
Because AJ T's on the mic and that
I said bubble (Bubble), vibes and that (Vibes)
Cruise like a four-wheel drive and that (Drive)
Tek time, everyting’s live and that
Because AJ T's on the mic and that (Mic)

[Post-Chorus: Jorja Smith]
No one knows the pain
No one sees what I see in you
No one feels the same
No one sees myself like you do

[Verse 1]
Watch the sun now
Had a likkle beef but it's done now (It's done)
I just need a drink and a rub down
When my team's in the place, it's a shut down (Down)
I'ma ride on the wave 'til it’s sundown (Wave it)
Peng ting lookin’ like a touchdown (Gorgeous)
All my haters getting vexed 'cause I’m up now (Vexed)
I went up, then my kettle got bust down (Bling, blaow)
Watch the sun now
Had a likkle beef but it's done now (It's done)
I just need a drink and a rub down
When my team's in the place, it’s a shutdown (Down)
I'ma ride on the wave 'til it's sundown (Wave it)
Peng ting, looking like a touchdown (Gorgeous)
All my haters getting vexed 'cause I'm up now (Why you mad?)
I went up, then my kettle got bust down (Bling, blaow)

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
Yo, it's the hyperman set
AJ Tracey, live and direct
DJ mash up the, mash up the deck
The microphone champ is live and direct
And again, it's the hyperman set (Yeah)
AJ Tracey, live and direct (Who?)
DJ mash up the, mash up the deck

[Post-Chorus: Jorja Smith]
No one knows the pain
No one sees what I see in you
No one feels the same
No one sees myself like you do

[Verse 2]
I'm a rock, I'm a rockstar (Psych out)
I get the yattie love like a popstar (Woo)
And when I'm in my ends, I'm a block star
Wait, everybody run from the cop car (Woo-woo)
And I don't know about sober (I don't)
I'm just a block boy sittin' in a Rover (21)
I got my friends and my fam on my shoulder (Facts)
I been cold but my money got me colder
Said I'm a rockstar (Yeah)
I get the yattie love like a popstar (Uh)
And when I'm in my ends, I'm a block star (True)
Wait everybody run from the cop car (Woo-woo)
And I don't know about sober (I don't)
I'm just a block boy sitting in a Rover
 (I swear)
I got my friends and my fam on my shoulder (On my back)
I been cold, but my money got me colder

[Post-Chorus: Jorja Smith]
No one knows the pain
No one sees what I see in you
No one feels the same
No one sees myself like you do
