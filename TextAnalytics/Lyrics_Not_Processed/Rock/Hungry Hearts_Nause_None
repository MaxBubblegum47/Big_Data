We are the fire burning in the world
We gonna light up the darkest night
We are the kids with the hungry hearts
And they can never keep us a part
Yeah, we go higher than high
Until we kiss the sky
So don't matter what you've heard
We are the people, we rule the world
(We are the people, we rule the world)
(We are the people, we rule the world)
Out of the dark and into the sun
You cannot change what we have become
We are the kids with the hungry hearts
And they can never keep us a part
Yeah, we go higher than high
Until we kiss the sky
So don't matter what you've heard
We are the people, we rule the world
(We are the people, we rule the world)
