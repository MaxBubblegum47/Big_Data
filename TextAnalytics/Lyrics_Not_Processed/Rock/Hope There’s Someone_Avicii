[Verse 1]
Hope there's someone who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?
And hope there's someone who'll set my heart free
Rest alone when I'm tired

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed
How will I fall asleep tonight?
How will I rest my head?

[Chorus]
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed
Oohh...! Oohh...!

[Beat Break]

[Chorus - Variation]
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed...
Ohhh...! Ohhh...!
