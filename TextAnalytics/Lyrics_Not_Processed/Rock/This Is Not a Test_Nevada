[Verse 1: tobyMac & 
Jon White
]
Fell out of the sky
Hit the ground running
The future is tonight
They'll never see us coming
Taken by this urgency, won't let this moment pass
The Kingdom is alive
We're stepping on the gas

[Pre-Chorus: tobyMac, 
Jon White
, & 
Cole Walowac
]
We're checking in, so check it out 
(ahh)
We're dropping in, there ain't no stopping us now
We've only got one shot
Gonna take it now
Goin' all in, gonna make it count
Won't look back, gonna set my eyes
Cause there ain't no practice runs in life

[Chorus: tobyMac]
This is not a, this is not a test
This is the real thing
This is not a, this is not a test
This is the real thing
We gonna go til we got nothing left
This is the real thing
This is not a, this is not a
This is not a test
This is not a test
This is not a test test

[Pre-Chorus: tobyMac, 
Jon White
, & 
Cole Walowac
]
We're checking in, so check it out 
(ahh)
We're dropping in, there ain't no stopping us now
We're breathin' in, we're breathin' out 
(ahh)
We're dropping in, there ain't no stopping us now
We've only got one shot
Gonna take it now
Goin' all in, gonna make it count
Won't look back, gonna set my eyes
Cause there ain't no practice runs in life

[Refrain]
This is life
This is life
This is life
This is life
This is life, this is life
This is life, this is life
Life, life, li-li-li-li-
So don't get left behind

[Chorus: tobyMac]
This is not a, this is not a test
This is the real thing
This is not a, this is not a test
This is the real thing
We gonna go til we got nothing left
This is the real thing
This is not a, this is not a
This is not a test

[Outro: tobyMac]
We gonna move
Live every second, make it count for you
Make it count, make it count
We gonna move
Live every second, make it count for you
Make it count, make it count
This is not a test
We gonna move
Live every second, make it count for you
