[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the world
There is a father and a mother
And the father is a son, who has a mother
The mother has a daughter
Who gets married to the brother of a mother
And they all just tryna multiply with one another

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends 'til the end, then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in the world
They think they're working for themselves
They get up every day to go to work for someone else
And somebody works for them
And so, they think they've got it made
But they're all just working to get paid the very same

[Chorus]
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Dum, dum, dum, dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Dum, dum, dum, dum)
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Skiddly-dee-dat-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Dum, dum, dum)

[Verse 3]
Somewhere in the world
You got a robber and a bank
And the bank robbed the people
So the people rob the bank
And the police came to get him, but they let him get away
'Cause they're all just working to get paid the very same

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends 'til the end, and then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world

[Chorus]
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Skiddly-dee-dat-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Dum, dum, dum, dum)
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Skiddly-dee-dat-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Dum, dum, dum)

[Bridge]
Don't believe everything that you hear
Let it go through your left and right ear
Don't just march to the beat of that drum
Don't be one of them people just twiddlin' them thumbs

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that's just the way of the world (Way of the world)
It never ends 'til the end, and then you start again (Start again)
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world

[Chorus]
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (Keep on)
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Skiddly-dee-dat-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Woo, woo, dum, dum, dum)
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (Keep on, keep on)
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Skiddly-dee-dat-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (Laa)
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum
(Skiddly-dee-dat-dat-dat-de-dat-dum-dum)

[Outro]
And so, they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (Keep on, keep on)
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Dum, dum, dum, dum)
They keep on, they keep on
They gonna keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum
'Cause that's just the way of the world
