No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in

Cannot do it, I cannot do it

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all alright
That is I think it's not too bad

Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I mean I think a "no", a "yes"
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you back, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
