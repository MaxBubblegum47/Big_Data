[Hook: Kate Elsworth]
Watching the world from above the clouds
A beautiful high, and I can't come down
Losing my senses, out of space
State of mind, you can't replace
Who would have thought the stars are true
Close my eyes, I'm next to you

[Instrumental: Dirty South & Thomas Gold]

Who would have thought the stars are true
Close my eyes, I'm next to you
Close my eyes, I'm next to you

Close my eyes, I'm next to you
