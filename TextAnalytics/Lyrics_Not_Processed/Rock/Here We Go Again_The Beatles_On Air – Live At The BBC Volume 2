Here we go again
Here we go again and again
Wond'rin’ how it all began
Wond'rin' will it ever end
Round and round we go
Where it’s going, nobody knows
Though I know we've been this place before
Someone keeps on moving the door
Here we go agai-ai-ai-ain
Here we go agai-ain
Here we go agai-ai-ai-ain
Here we go agai-ain
So I say hello again
And nobody gives a damn
And nobody wants to hold your hand
Ev'ryone is an also-ran
Round and round we go
Where it's going, nobody knows
Though I know we've seen this place before
Someone keeps on moving the door
Here we go agai-ai-ai-ain
Here we go agai-ain
Here we go agai-ai-ai-ain
Here we go agai-ain
Round and round we go-oh-oh-oh
Round and round we go-oh
Here we go agai-ai-ai-ain
Here we go agai-ain
