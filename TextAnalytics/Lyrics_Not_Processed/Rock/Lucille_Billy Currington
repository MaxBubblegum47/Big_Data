[Verse 1]
In a bar in Toledo, across from the depot
On a bars tool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over
I sat down and asked her her name
When the drinks finally hit her
She said," I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings
In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking
His big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

[Chorus]
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
I've lived through some sad times
But this time the hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

[Verse 2]
After he left us, I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the barroom to the rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her, for the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

[Chorus]
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
I've lived through some sad times
But this time the hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
I've lived through some sad times
But this time the hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
