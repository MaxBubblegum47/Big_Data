(Ooh yeah)

[Verse 1]
I've been to the left, I've been to the right
I've found myself in Abu Dhabi, just a mirage in the night
Been to the high, I've been to the low
And I've been to lots of places that I didn't wanna go
But I ainâ€™t seen nothing to get me off my ass
And laughed at all the jokers want to make me walk on glass
I could walk there, or I could crawl
And I was meaner than a bad dog
With his back against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Animal, animal
Cannibal, cannibal
See 'em fall, see 'em fall
I'm the guy that they call...

[Chorus]
Meanstreak
I got a meanstreak
Meanstreak
They call me "meanstreak"

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
I just don't know who I want to be
The count of Monte Cristo or the sheik of Araby
Eaten rich, yeah, and I've eaten free
And I'm the perfect culture vulture in the face of poverty
And I ain't met no one who told me I got class
They say never feed the animal
The boy's got too much flesh
I'm the guy, ah, ya just can't teach
And I always kick the castle that's
Been built up on the beach (heh ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
Animal, animal
Cannibal, cannibal
See 'em fall, see 'em fall
I'm the guy that they call...

What's your name?

[Chorus]
Meanstreak
I got a meanstreak
Run 'em down, I'm back
I got a meanstreak
Want to feel a meanstreak?
They call me "meanstreak"
???, meanstreak
What's my name?
Meanstreak
