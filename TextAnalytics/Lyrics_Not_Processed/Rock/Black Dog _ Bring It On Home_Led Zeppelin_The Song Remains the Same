[Intro]
[Instrumental intro of "Bring It on Home"]

Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Uh-uh child, is that the way you swing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Ah ha, child when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, I can't keep away

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flamin' heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine, burnin' red
Dreams of you all through my head

Ah ah...  (Ah ha)
Ah ah...  (Ah ha)
Ah ah...  (Ah ha)
Aaahh

Keep up
Keep up

[Guitar Solo]

Good evening!
