[Verse 1]
Baby, who was I before I met you?
Honestly I'm too scared to look back
Like a wildfire deep inside got turned loose
You're the only one who made me feel that
Now the sun is setting, let it take you baby
Take every drop of you and drink you in

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I know
You put the magic in my bones
Now I know
You put the magic in my bones

[Chorus]
You put the magic in my bones
You put the magic in my bones
(Bones, bones, bones...)

[Verse 2]
Now when I look at you
I can't move, I'm dreaming
I wanna keep this moment froze in time
Nothing you can do to undo those three words
It's enough to bring a dead heart back to life

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I know
You put the magic in my bones
Now I know
You put the magic in my bones

[Chorus]
You put the magic in my bones
You put the magic in my bones

[Outro]
Now I know
You put the magic in my bones
