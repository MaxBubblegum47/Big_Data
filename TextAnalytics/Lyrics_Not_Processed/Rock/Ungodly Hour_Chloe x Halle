[Verse 1]
Hit me with your eyes
I never seen that kind of view
You walkin' over here
The way that it went down, that's when I knew
We be talkin' all night
But I can tell you need to work on you, you, you
Like you, you, you, like you
Like you, mmm
You be playin' sweet
But, baby, don't you know that talk is cheap
Can't fool me
I wish that you could back it up for me, me, me
Like me, me, me, like me

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I, I heard it all before
You're hesitant, but you could give me more
I know you like to play those silly games
When you're done, call my name

[Chorus]
When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me)
When you decide you need someone (Call up on me)
When you don't have to think about it
Love me at the ungodly hour
When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me)
When you decide you need someone (Call up on me)
When you don't have to think about it
Love me at the ungodly hour

[Verse 2]
I don't have the time
To teach you how to love all over again
And let me ask you this
Are you givin' all that you could give?
Once you get it right
Baby, just know I want you here, come here
Right here

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I, I heard it all before
You're hesitant, but you could give me more
I know you like to play those silly games
When you're done, call my name

[Chorus]
When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me)
When you decide you need someone (Call up on me)
When you don't have to think about it
Love me at the ungodly hour
When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me)
When you decide you need someone (Oh, call up on me)
When you don't have to think about it
Love me at the ungodly hour

[Bridge]
Love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me (Ah)
Love me (Ah)
Love me, love me, love me, love me (Ah, ah)
Love me (Ah)
Love me, love me, love me, love me
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Won't you love me?

[Chorus]
When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me, babe)
When you decide you need someone (Call up on me, baby boy)
When you don't have to think about it
Love me at the ungodly hour
When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me)
When you decide you need someone (Call up on me)
When you don't have to think about it
Love me at the ungodly hour
When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me)
When you decide you need someone (Call up on me)
When you don't have to think about it
Love me at the ungodly hour
When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me)
When you decide you need someone (Call up on me)
When you don't have to think about it
Love me at the ungodly hour

[Outro]
Yeah, baby, baby
Won't you love me? Won't you love me?
Won't you hold me? Won't you?
Love me at the ungodly hour
Yeah
Love me at the ungodly hour
Won't you love me?
Won't you love me, love me, love me, love me?
(Love me at the ungodly hour)
