[Intro]
Mmm
Na-na
Na-na-na, na-na

[Verse 1]
I miss you
Miss you so bad
I don't forget you
Oh, it's so sad

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

[Chorus]
The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same
Oh

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na
Na-na-na, na-na

[Verse 2]
I didn't get around to kiss you
Goodbye on the hand
I wish that I could see you again
I know that I can't
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope you can hear me
'Cause I remember it clearly

[Chorus]
The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same
Oh

[Bridge]
I've had my wake up, won't you wake up?
I keep askin' why (I keep askin' why)
And I can't take it, it wasn't fake, it
It happened, you passed by
Now you're gone, now you're gone
There you go, there you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Now you're gone, now you're gone
There you go, there you go
Somewhere you're not coming back

[Chorus]
The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same
No
The day you slipped away
Was the day that I found it won't be the same
Oh

[Outro]
Na-na
Na-na-na, na-na
I miss you
