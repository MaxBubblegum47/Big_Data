[Chorus: bearface]
Cut your thighs
You want me blind
I wish you cried too
And lately I, pressing your time, shaking I'm through

[Verse: bearface]
Thank you notes came falling out your mouth
Never wished for you to see it, was never what we were about
Only color in your eyes when you look me through that blue
Now you're sinking 'cause the water risin' up around your collar
If you wish to call me over, I'd be right around the corner
I'd be in the water with ya, I'd be sinking with you
But you

[Chorus: bearface]
Cut your thighs
You want me blind
I wish you cried too
And lately I, pressing your time, shaking I'm through

[Bridge: bearface]
Stay clear, ah
Stay clear, ooo
Stay clear, ah-ahh
Stay clear, ooo

[Outro: bearface]
Hundred thousand miles gone to form your lie
Comatose and left on a fault line
Hold me back or I'll fall on cold old light
Come to us for fixing your sore mind
Hundred thousand miles gone to form your lie
Comatose and left on a fault line
The fault line
The fault line
The fault line, yeah
The fault line
