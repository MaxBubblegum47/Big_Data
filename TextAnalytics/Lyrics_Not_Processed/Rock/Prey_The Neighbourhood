[Verse 1]
As long as you notice
I'm hoping that you'll keep your heart open
I'll keep mine open too
If you don't ask, I won't tell
Just know that, just know that
It all hurts, it all hurts just the same

[Chorus 1]
Something is wrong, I can't explain
Everything changed when the birds came
You'll never know what they might do if they catch you too early
We need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how
Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying

[Verse 2]
As long as you notice
I'm hoping that you'll keep your heart open
I'll keep mine open too
So, so, I'll probably take you aside
And tell you what's on my mind
But you, you'll just keep it inside
Probably tell me that you're alright

[Chorus 1]
Something is wrong, I can't explain
Everything changed when the birds came
You'll never know what they might do if they catch you too early
We need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how
Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying

[Bridge]
(If I run) If I run away I'll never know
(What you want)
And if you go then Iâ€™ll never grow
(I'm undone)
Let me slip, let me slide
(If you run) I'll be sure to let you fly

[Chorus 2]
Something is off, I can't explain
You know what I mean, don't you?
Something I saw, or something I did that made me like this
Could you help me?
We need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how
Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying
Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying

[Verse 3]
So, so, I'll probably take you aside
And tell you what's on my mind
But you, you'll just keep it inside
Probably tell me that you're alright
So, so, I'll probably take you aside
And tell you what's on my mind
But you, you'll just keep it inside
Probably tell me that you're alright

[Outro]
I don't want to fight
I don't want to fight
I don't want to fight
I don't want to fight
