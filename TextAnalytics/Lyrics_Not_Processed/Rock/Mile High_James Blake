[Intro: James Blake]
Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
We on a drive, looped in
Two seat ride, couped in
Who gon' slide? Who's in?
Big rocks 'round, new tint
Fleetwood down, new sand
Two seat ride, couped in
Don't leave 'round loose ends
Don't be around new friends, yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
We just be mile high clubbin'
I'm on a thousand miles runnin'
Hit it, go downtown Sunday
Then move it uptown Monday

[Post-Chorus: James Blake]
Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
If I give it to you, will you leave?
Tell it to you, will you speak?
Got it tatted on my sleeve
Fell in love overseas
Ass fatter than a peach, uh
Ocean water kinda deep, uh
Rollin' up out the reef, uh
Put me down, straight to sleep

[Refrain: Travis Scott & 
James Blake
]
Lasting like Duracell
Lasting like Duracell
40 days, 40 nights
Feel like a holy night
The lesson's always there
That less is always more
And in the back and forth
I'm not keeping score
Lesson's always there
That less is always more
When you're alone with me
You never come up short
You never come up short
(
Never come up short, never come up short, never come—
)

[Verse 3: James Blake]
Watch the fan as it spins
In my arms, wrapped in
Don't know where you stop
And where I begin
Like I found myself an imaginary friend
And when we stay in
Not missin' anything

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
We just be mile high clubbin'
I'm on a thousand miles runnin'
Hit it, go downtown Sunday
Then move it uptown Monday

[Post-Chorus: James Blake]
Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

[Verse 4: James Blake]
Hi-Vis, never seen
Low-key as it's been
Fell in love overseas
Fell in love like it's easy
Put to sleep without dreams
Under the moonbeam
Call you for no reason
Hold on like it's greasy

[Refrain: Travis Scott, 
James Blake
 & 
Both
]
Lasting like Duracell
Lasting like Duracell
40 days, 40 nights
Feel like a holy night
The lesson's always there
That less is always more
And in the back and forth
I'm not keeping score
Lesson's always there
That less is always more
When you're alone with me
You never come up short
You never come up short
(Never come up short, never come up short, never come—)

[Outro: James Blake]
Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself
