Take 102

[Guitars and drums being at ready]
One, Two, Three, Four

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Not guilty
For getting in your way
While you're trying to steal the day
Not guilty
And I'm not here for the rest
I'm not trying to steal your vest

[Bridge]
I am not trying to be smart
I only want what I can get

[Chorus]
I'm really sorry for your ageing head
But like you heard me said
Not guilty

[Verse 2]
Not guilty
For being on your street
Getting underneath your feet
Not guilty
No use handing me a writ
While I'm trying to do my bit

[Bridge]
I don't expect to take your heart
I only want what I can get

[Chorus]
I'm really sorry that you're underfed
But like you heard me said
Not guilty

[Verse 3]
Not guilty
For looking like a freak
Making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray
On the road to Mandalay

[Bridge]
I won't upset the apple cart
I only want what I can get

[Chorus]
I'm really sorry that you've been misled
But like you heard me said
Not guilty
