[Intro]
Gotta think about it
Gotta think about it
Gotta think about it
Gotta think about it

[Verse 1]
Here I am, girl, talkin' to myself again
Every night I think about a way to end

[Pre-Chorus]
All these accusations, all these allegations
Do you wanna know what I really think about them?
All these situations, riding on my patience
Do you wanna know what I really think about you, baby?

[Chorus]
Go fuck yourself
Bitch, I gotta say that
Bitch, I gotta say that
Go
Go fuck yourself
Bitch, I gotta say that
Bitch, I gotta say that
Go

[Verse 2]
Here I am, girl, talkin’ to myself again
Every night I think about the words you said

[Pre-Chorus]
All these accusations, all these allegations
Do you wanna know what I really think about them?
All these situations, riding on my patience
Do you wanna know what I really think about you, baby?

[Chorus]
Go fuck yourself
Bitch, I gotta say that
Bitch, I gotta say that
Go
Go fuck yourself
Bitch, I gotta say that
Bitch, I gotta say that
Go

[Interlude]
And whether your relationship is awful, good, or great, we don't like endings. We don't like to lose things. And especially, we don’t like to lose things that are important to us. And make no mistake, relationships are the single most important thing to you and your life. It's the source of all of your best memories. It's the source of all of your worst memories. When you think back on your life and you're 95, a hundred years old, and you look back over the course of your lifetime, you're not gonna think, "I wish I owned a better phone, I wish I spent more time on the internet. I wish I spent more time at work or sleeping," it's not gonna be any of those kinds of things. It's gonna be, "I wish I spent more time with the people I love."

[Bridge]
Where do you belong if I gotta think about it?
Gotta think about it, baby
Where do you belong if I gotta think about it?
Gotta think about it, baby
Where do you belong if I gotta think about it?
Gotta think about it, baby
Where do you belong if I gotta think about it?
Gotta think about it, baby

[Outro]
Where do you belong if I gotta think about it?
Gotta think about it, baby
Where do you belong if I gotta think about it?
Gotta think about it
