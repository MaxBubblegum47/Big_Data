[Intro: Shordie Shordie]
Block shit, when we out, nobody's comin' out (Yung Lan on the track)
This shit get dangerous, don't bang with us, nobody's leavin' out
We made 'em favor us, can't hang with us, nobody's leavin' out
Like where you goin'? Ain't you from that bitch? Nobody's screamin' out (James 'bout that check, boy)

[Chorus: Shordie Shordie]
Other side keep sayin' they want that boy dead
Them niggas play, we puttin' money on his head
I'ma always slide through, just know I'm behind you
'Cause them niggas played, them niggas know they gon' lay
I've been so lonely
Missin' you bad, wasn't on 'em
I wish you had them knowing, you had a bag
Wish I could get you back, but now we just got memories

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Miss you like never before, mentioned in hella my songs
Can't seem to let you go, trippin' forever, it's on
Wish you'd answer the phone, nigga be like, "Why?"
Why they steal the real ones and leave the suckers alive?
Hey, I don't understand how they love you and never slide
You ain't tryna yellow-tape nothin', why you subscribe?
Trauma went untreated, a lot of shit on my mind
Apes together strong, but conquer when we divided
Brief moment of silence for the lost soldiers
Forever Pebbles, you can kill me if I cross over
And we ain't talkin' nothin' over, bitch, we smother shit
I do my Dougie with this fully, word to mother's kids
Love the whole hundred clip

[Chorus: Shordie Shordie]
Other side keep sayin' they want that boy dead
Them niggas play, we puttin' money on his head
I'ma always slide through, just know I'm behind you
'Cause them niggas played, them niggas know they gon' lay
I've been so lonely
Missin' you bad, wasn't on 'em
I wish you had them knowing, you had a bag
Wish I could get you back, but now we just got memories

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
Below zero was my heart temperature, nigga
It's hard to picture you stiff, hop out the Masi' with stick
I'm kamikaze with clique, my akhi bodied his whip
Attempted bodies exempt, we slide mani'
You ain't prostitutin' your lil' coochie, then you fired, baby
She don't get that Louis purse she want, then she's a crybaby
Thank you for that K that niggas gave me, bitch, I needed it
Call me when you need me, bitch, I'm pullin' up immediately, on mother's kids
Where he from? Bome again
Run it up and fuck a bitch, I'm worth over a hundred kicks in cash, nigga
Lamborghini truck is slow as shit, I do the dash in 'em
I got off my ass and bought a bag, ain't never asked niggas, gangland

[Chorus: Shordie Shordie]
Other side keep sayin' they want that boy dead
Them niggas play, we puttin' money on his head
I'ma always slide through, just know I'm behind you
'Cause them niggas played, them niggas know they gon' lay
I've been so lonely
Missin' you bad, wasn't on 'em
I wish you had them knowing, you had a bag
Wish I could get you back, but now we just got memories

[Post-Chorus: Shordie Shordie]
Other side keep sayin' they want that boy dead (Woah)
Them niggas played, we puttin' money on his head
I'ma always slide through, just know I'm behind you
If them niggas play, them niggas know they gon' lay
I've been so lonely
Missin' you bad, wasn't on 'em
I wish you had them knowing, you had a bag
Wish I could get you back, but now we just got memories

[Outro: Mozzy & Shordie Shordie]
Woah
Hey, wish I could get you back, but now we just got memories
R.I.P. Lo, R.I.P. Cardo
R.I.P. Virgil (Wish I could get you back, but now we just got memories)
R.I.P. Pig, R.I.P. Pork
Rest easy, Reese
Rest in peace Vern
Damn
It's too many
Long live all the soldiers
