[Intro]
(Eye-eye-eye)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ooh)
Sun sets in the west (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ooh)
Boy has gone to rest (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ooh)
Mama clutch her breast (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ooh oh)

[Chorus]
All creatures great and small
Graze on blood-red soil
And grass that grows on city streets
It's been a quiet town
Since the juice went down
Now something's washed up on the beach
A man alive

[Spoken ]
After some thousands of years
Fewer than the smallest imaginable intake of breath
The wisest guys in the evolution of humanity became extinct
Mother Nature loves a vacuum
And so, the Earth was cleansed
In no time at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
All creatures great and small
Graze on blood-red soil
And grass that grows on city streets
It's been a quiet town
Until the word got round
That something washed up on the beach
A man alive

[Outro]
A man alone
Washed up on the beach
Just a man
Whoosh...
