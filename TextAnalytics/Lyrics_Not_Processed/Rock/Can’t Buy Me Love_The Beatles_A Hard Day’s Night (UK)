[Intro]
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love

[Verse 1]
I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
'Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Verse 2]
I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Chorus]
Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no-no-no, no!

[Verse 3]
Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
Ow!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no-no-no, no!

[Verse 4]
Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Chorus]
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love
