[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus 1]
Good Golly said little Miss Molly
When she was rocking in the house of blue light
Tutti Frutti was oh so rooty
When she was rocking to the east and west

[Verse 1]
Lucille was oh so real
When she didn't do her daddy's will
Come on baby drive me crazy do it do it

[Chorus 2]
I'm a speed king
You got to hear me sing
I'm a speed king
See me fly

[Verse 2]
Saturday night and I just got paid
Going to fool about isn't going to save
Some people going to rock some people gonna roll
Going to have a party to save my soul
Hard headed woman and a soft hearted man
They been causing trouble since it all began
Take a little rice take a little beans
Going to rock and roll down to New Orleans

[Chorus 2]

[Dueling Organ/Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Some people going to rock some people going to roll
Going to have a party to save my soul
Come on baby drive me crazy do it do it
