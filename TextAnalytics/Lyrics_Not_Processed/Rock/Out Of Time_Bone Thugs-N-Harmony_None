[Intro: Felecia & Krazyie Bone]
F-E-L-E-C-I-A, Felecia and Bone Thugs
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
I better wake up early, [?] gettin' it live all by myself
A nigga been out tryna get my mail
On the block all night, nigga, nothin' but [?]
I know you wanna leave me, but can I get from the first to the fifteenth at least?
I know I been buggin', see? But that's just the thug in me
That's how the thug lovin' be
She gotta understand, nigga, I am what I am, that's all that I am
Thuggin's the only thing that I am, girl, I'm just a man
Sippin' on forty ounces, thuggin'
When she put it up on the block, "I was doin' my usual, makin' money," that's what she said

[Verse 2: Felecia]
Listen up, ain't playin', I think it's time for us to talk
Sick and tired of feelin' like a trophy on the wall
You don't ever touch me, only time you hold me is when you feelin' fly and wanna show me to your homies
You think it's all good 'cause I don't really say shit
I'ma get real hood if I don't see some changes
Because I'm in a new place, 'bout to start a new phase
You got 'til first to try to get yourself on my page

[Chorus: Felecia]
Tick tock, boy, you runnin' out of time-time
I promise that I ain't gon' change my mind-my mind
If you can't get it, you'll be left behind
Boy, you got until the first of month
Tick tock, boy, you runnin' out of time-time
I promise that I ain't gon' change my mind-my mind
If you can't get it, you'll be left behind
Boy, you got until the first of month
Uh huh, uh huh

[Verse 3: Felecia]
Time up for talkin', I ain't got nothin' left to say
And I don't like repeatin' myself so I won't play these games
Every time I ask a serious question, you be like, "huh?"
If you 'huh' me, you can hear me, why you actin' like you dumb?
I'm too cool to be wrackin' my brain all over the stuff that you do
Think I'm playin'? Test me, I'll show you
Can't believe all the mess that I go through
And I don't have to, that's why I'm sayin'...

[Chorus: Felecia]
Tick tock, boy, you runnin' out of time-time
I promise that I ain't gon' change my mind-my mind
If you can't get it, you'll be left behind
Boy, you got until the first of month (you got until the first to get it right)
Tick tock, boy, you runnin' out of time-time (the clock is tickin')
I promise that I ain't gon' change my mind-my mind
If you can't get it, you'll be left behind
Boy, you got until the first of month (You got until the first of the month)

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone]
See, I'm up against a race against the clock
And I'm up against the race against the cops
It feel like my back's against the wall now that I'm racin' for your heart
With all of the pressure a nigga is feelin', I'm findin' it hard for my life to keep pace you
Want it right now? Hold on, be patient
If you only knew what a nigga was faced with
Heavy off in the game, truth to you, boo, I ain't runnin' no game
I love ya, you gotta believe me
You gotta believe me, don't lose no faith
I'ma give you all of me soon, don't lose no faith tonight
To stay down and I promise to love you for the rest of my life-life

[Chorus: Felecia]
Tick tock, boy, you runnin' out of time-time (boy, you runnin' out of time)
I promise that I ain't gon' change my mind-my mind (I'm countin' all the days)
If you can't get it, you'll be left behind (I'm countin' by the hours, minutes, seconds)
Boy, you got until the first of month
Tick tock, boy, you runnin' out of time-time
I promise that I ain't gon' change my mind-my mind (Ain't gon' change my mind)
If you can't get it, you'll be left behind
