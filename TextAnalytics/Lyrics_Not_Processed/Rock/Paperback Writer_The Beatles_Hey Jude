[Intro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer (writer, writer)

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney, McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
It's based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job, so I want to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer!

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
It's a dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesn't understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail
It's a steady job, but he wants to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer!

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer (writer, writer)

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, (Lennon & Harrison), McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
It's a thousand pages, give or take a few (Frère)
I'll be writing more in a week or two (Jacques)
I could make it longer if you like the style (Frère)
I can change it 'round and I want to be a paperback writer (Jacques)
Paperback writer!

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney, (Lennon & Harrison), McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
If you really like it, you can have the rights (Frère)
It could make a million for you overnight (Jacques)
If you must return it, you can send it here (Frère)
But I need a break, and I want to be a paperback writer (Jacques)
Paperback writer!

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer (writer, writer)

[Outro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer, paperback writer
Paperback writer, paperback writer
Paperback writer, paperback writer
Paperback writer, paperback writer
