[Intro]
Come on noon
You gotta get on board

[Verse 1]
Come on, noon train
Come on, need to get out
I said come on, noon train
Come on, don't you mess me about

[Pre-Chorus]
You see
I've tried and I found no way to get out
I said I tried and I found
There's no comin' back for me

[Chorus]
(No man's land)
Know you gotta get away
(No man's land)
Fight and live another day

[Verse 2]
Caught in a hard rain
'Cause you know I need to get out
Hey, hey
Head out on the wide plain
Come on don't you fool me around

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I sought and I found
It's hard to get out
I said, I fought and I found
There's no comin' back for me

[Chorus]
(No man's land)
Know you gotta get away
(No man's land)
Fight and live another day
(No man's land)
In the middle of the fray
(No man's land)
Fly, fly, fly away

[Bridge]
(No man's land)
No man's land
(No man's land)
I said there's no comin' back for me

[Chorus]
(No man's land)
Know you gotta get away
(No man's land)
Livе to fight on another day
(No man's land)
In the middle of thе fray
(No man's land)
Fly, fly, fly away, hey
(No man's land)
No man's land
You know you gotta get away
(No man's land)
Live to fight another, fight another day
(No man's land)
