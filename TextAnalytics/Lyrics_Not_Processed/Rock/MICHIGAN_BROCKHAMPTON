[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Dun-dun-dun-dun
Dun-dun, dun-dun

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing me
I think I fell in love again in Michigan
(And the whip right there and it's parked outside)
Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing me
I think I fell in love again in Michigan
(And the whip right there and it's parked outside)

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Let us stay for more pain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more brain
Let us stay for more brain
Let us stay for more days
Let us stay for more pain
Let us pray for more rain
Let us pray for more rain

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
But who really knows, yeah? (let us stay for more pain)
But who really knows? (let us stay for more pain)

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Wild child
Been alone for a while now
If you gotta turn it down, down
Wild child
Been alone for a while now
If you gotta turn it down, down
(And the whip right there and it's parked outside)

[Break: Kevin Abstract]
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I get, I get, I get
Let us stay for more brain
And I get, I get, I get
Let us pray for more rain
Let us stay for more pain
Let us stay for more brain
Let us stay for more rain
(I been waiting for you)
Let us stay for more days
Let us stay for more pain
Let us pray for more rain
(I'm always lookin' for you)
