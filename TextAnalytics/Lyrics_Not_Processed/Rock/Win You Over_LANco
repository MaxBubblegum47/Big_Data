[Verse 1]
Pick you up at 7
You're ready by 8
You call it hanging out
But I'm calling it a date
Anything that I can do to try and get a shot at you
This could be my night to prove

[Chorus]
I could be the one you call baby
You could be the one that I love like crazy
Every night 'til the end of forever
The kind of love that only gets better
We could be the one in a million
Butterflies, once in a lifetime feeling
If it's too fast, I can take it slower
But tonight I'm gonna win you over, over

[Verse 2]
Driving on a back road
Going about 45
Put your hand on my knee
Never felt so alive
This must be the feeling that they talk about in movies
Never thought I'd find the one who can do it to me

[Chorus]
I could be the one you call baby
You could be the one that I love like crazy
Every night 'til the end of forever
The kind of love that only gets better
We could be the one in a million
Butterflies, once in a lifetime feeling
If it's too fast, I can take it slower
But tonight I'm gonna win you over, over
I'm gonna win you over, over
I'm gonna win you

[Bridge]
I know it's getting late and you need to get home
But life's too short to go it alone
We all need something to get us through
I could be yours and mine could be you

[Chorus]
I could be the one you call baby
You could be the one that I love like crazy
Every night 'til the end of forever
The kind of love that only gets better
We could be the one in a million
Butterflies, once in a lifetime feeling
If it's too fast, I can take it slower
But tonight I'm gonna win you over, over
I'm gonna win you over, over

[Outro]
I'm gonna win you over, over
I'm gonna win you over, over
I'm gonna win you
