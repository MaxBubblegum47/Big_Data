[Intro]
Wait forâ€”
Okay

[Verse 1]
You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know you can count me out

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We're all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait

[Chorus]
Well don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

[Verse 3]
[Instrumental/Scat]
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright

[Verse 4]
You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You ask me that it's evolution
Well you know
We don't love to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know you can count me out

[Outro]
Well, don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Be alright
Alright, alright
