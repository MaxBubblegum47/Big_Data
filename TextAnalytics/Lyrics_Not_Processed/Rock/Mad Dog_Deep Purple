[Verse 1]
Don't look too long in my face, it could be a big mistake
I'm hanging on a thread so fine, I need a little space
I shouldn't say
But I know, know I must
I've had enough of pain, I'm pissed off standing in the rain

[Chorus]
It makes me feel like a mad dog
I've got nothing to lose
A mad dog
You've got nothing I can use
A mad dog
Howling at the moon
A mad dog

[Verse 2]
I need no friends, I'm on the edge of a broken dream
Laughing at the pain, but it makes me want to scream
And I should have known, she'd be no no good
She tore my heart in two, but I don't need to talk to you

[Chorus]
You make me feel like a mad dog
I've got nothing to lose
A mad dog
You've got nothing I can use
A mad dog
Howling the moon
Mad dog

[Verse 3]
She said, "A hard man is good to find"
And then she raised her doubts
All that I could give she took, and then she threw me out
Well, I don't care, I don't care anymore
I'm going to lose my grip, I'm going to let it rip
Ow, wow, yeaow yeah!

[Chorus]
A mad dog
I've got nothing to lose
A mad dog
You've got nothing I can use
A mad dog
Howling at the moon
A mad dog
A mad dog
A mad dog
A mad dog
A mad dog
Mad, mad, mad, mad, ow!
