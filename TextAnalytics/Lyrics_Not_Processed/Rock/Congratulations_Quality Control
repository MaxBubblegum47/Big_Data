[Intro: Post Malone]
Mm-mmm
Yeah, yeah
Mm-mmm
Yeah (Hey)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations" (Uh, uh, uh)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (Uh-huh)
They ain't never had the dedication (Uh, uh)
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it (Uh, uh)
Yeah, we made it (Uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like a addict, yeah
I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yuh (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everyone countin' on me, drop the ball, yuh (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes

[Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations" (Congratulations)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (Ooh)
They ain't never had the dedication (Uh, uh, ayy)
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it (Uh, uh)
Yeah, we made it (Uh, uh, uh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I was patient (Yeah, oh)
I was patient (Ayy, ooh)
Now I can scream that we made it (We made it!)
Now everywhere, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulation (Ooh)
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation (Yeah)
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby (Ball)
I'm looking for someone to call, baby (Brr)
But right now, I got a situation (Ayy)
Never old Ben-Ben Franklins (Cash)
Big rings (Ooh), champagne (Champagne)
My life is like a ball game (Ball game)
But instead, I'm in the trap though (Trap though)
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl (Super Bowl)
Super Bowl, call the hoes (Brr), get in the Rolls (Skrrt)
Top-floor lifestyle (Top), Huncho and Post (Yeah, ayy)
Malone (Ayy), I gotta play on my phone (Ayy)
You know what I'm on (Ayy), Huncho Houdini is gone (Ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations" (Ayy, uh, uh, uh)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (Uh-huh, ooh)
They ain't never had the dedication (Ayy, uh, uh)
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it (Yeah,  uh, uh)
Yeah, we made it (Ayy)
