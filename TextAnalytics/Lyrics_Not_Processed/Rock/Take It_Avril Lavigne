[Intro]
Just take it, take it
Can’t take it, take it

[Verse 1]
I know what you do, flash me
The way it’s done impolitely
Just tryin' to find some alone time
No room to compromise

[Chorus]
Just take it, take it
Can’t take it, take it
So send your picture to a magazine
Invasion's not true photography
Is that what you always wanted to be?
Well I’d be worried for you

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, gotta try, run and hide
Get away from this
I’ll get by in this life this time

[Verse 2]
Take your best shot, impress me
Write a fictional story for your fee
Try to get the world to believe
Shocking headline surprise

[Chorus]
Just take it, take it
Can't take it, take it
So send your picture to a magazine
Invasion's not true photography
Is that what you always wanted to be?
Well I’d be sorry for you

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, gotta try, run and hide
Get away from this
I’ll get by in this life this time

[Bridge]
You see me, I see you
You’re over there
You see me, I see you

[Chorus]
So send your picture to a magazine
Invasion's not true photography
Is that what you always wanted to be?
Well I’d be sorry for you

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, gotta try to run and hide
Get away from shit
Sometimes, gotta try, run and hide
Get away from this
