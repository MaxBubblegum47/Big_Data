[Intro: YG]
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Chorus: Polo G]
My youngins heartless, so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some more brains
On that corner, I couldn't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin' cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want more fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner self, "I promise you I won't change"

[Verse 1: Polo G]
We make it hot up on your block, we let that heat blow
Catch an opp, we dump the clip, it's time to reload
Put a scope on the AR just like a peephole
Think he a bully, we got choppers for the Deebo
Seven-figure nigga, tryna maximize them three O's
Before the bag, I was fucking all the freak hoes
Ballin' hard, young legend out the Chi, bitch, I'm like D-Rose
"Cap, how you make it out this shit?" I got the cheat code
Way more than life than just the hood, I'm tryna reach goals
Maxine my heart, since you've been gone, I miss your sweet soul, ayy
Never tell a statement, we won't leak those
Better not go talkin' to them people, better keep closed

[Chorus: Polo G]
My youngins heartless, so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some more brains
On that corner, I couldn't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin' cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want more fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner self, "I promise you I won't change"

[Verse 2: Polo G]
We hold a grudge and we want blood, we can't look past the issue
Play with us and you gon' die, nigga, it's kinda simple
Show no mercy, we gon' kill whoever ridin' with you
Catch you on the other side, then we gon' have to get you
Condolences to your family, they gon' have to miss you
Lil Joe on go and he gon' spark, that's if I pass the signal
My right-hand mans, he got his name 'cause he gon' blast the pistol
Earned our stripes, we gon' blow if a nigga play foul, you would think we had a whistle
Lil Capalot, G-O-A-T, yeah, that's that guy's initials
Happiness and depression, I'm stuck inside the middle
I fell in love with dollar signs, won't let my mind forget you
Fuck it off, we spend it all on fast cars and shinin' crystals

[Chorus: Polo G]
My youngins heartless, so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some more brains
On that corner, I couldn't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin' cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want more fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner self, "I promise you I won't change"
