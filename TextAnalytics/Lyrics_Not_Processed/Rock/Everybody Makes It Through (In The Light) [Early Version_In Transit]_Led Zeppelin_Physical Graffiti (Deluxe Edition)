Sunshine brings laughter
Rain clouds brings me down
I know forever after
I need the light, keep me ground
Whoa, mama, I get so lonely
In the rain, feel so blue
I want you to remember, I'm your one and only, woman
Hey baby, hey baby, love you true
Oh oh
Dream boy, on the river
Oh blue skies on my mind
Ah, the fields seemed to glitter
I know, I know, will bring you down
Ah baby, I've got some thinking
Whoa mama, strip my mind
Hey baby, I took a drinking
I know, I know come around
Oh oh
In the light, in the light
Ooh, yeah yeah
Oh girl, stop your crying
Oh woman, dry your eyes
Whoa tomorrow, the sun will be shining
You won't remember all the tears you cried
Hey baby, I think you wonder
Hey baby, tears of joy
Woman, tears of laughter
Sweet ma, sweet ma, I'm coming home, oh oh
'S all you got to do yeah
With the light
Everybody needs the light
The light
'S all you got to do now
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light
Oh
