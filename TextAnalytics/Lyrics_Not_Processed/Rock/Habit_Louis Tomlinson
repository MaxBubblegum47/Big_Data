[Verse 1]
I always said that I'd mess up eventually
I told you that, so what did you expect from me?
It shouldn't come as no surprise anymore
I know you said that you'd give me another chance
But you and I knew the truth of it in advance
That mentally, you were already out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
Never thought that giving up would be so hard
But God, I'm missing you and your addictive heart

[Chorus]
You're the habit that I can't break
You're the feelin' I can't put down
You're the shiver that I can't shake
You're the habit that I can't break
You're the high that I need right now
You're the habit that I can't break

[Verse 2]
I took some time 'cause I've ran out of energy
Of playing someone I heard I’m supposed to be
But honestly, I don't have to choose anymore
And it's been ages, different stages
Come so far from Princess Park
I'll always need ya
In front of me, in front of me

[Chorus]
You're the habit that I can't break
You're the feelin' I can't put down
You're the shiver that I can't shake
You're the habit that I can't break
You're the high that I need right now
You're the habit that I can't break

[Bridge]
You give me the time and the space
I was out of control
And I'm sorry I let you down
I guess that I know what I already knew
I was better with you
And I miss you now

[Chorus]
You're the habit that I can't break
You're the feelin' I can't put down
You're the shiver that I can't shake
You're the habit that I can't break
You're the high that I need right now
You're the habit that I can't break

[Outro]
You're the habit that I can't break
You're the feelin' I can't put down
You're the shiver that I can't shake
You're the habit that I can't break
You're the high that I need right now
You're the habit that I can't break
