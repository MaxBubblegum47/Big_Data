[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party
What a same mary jane
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party

[Verse 1]
She looks as an african queen
She eating twelve chapattis and cream
She taste as mongolian lamb
She coming from aldebaran

[Chorus]
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party
What a shame mary jane
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party

[Verse 2]
She like to be married with yeti
He cooking such groovy spaghetti
She jumping as mexican bean
To make that her body more thin

[Chorus]
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party
What a shame mary jane
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party

[Verse 3]
She catch patagonian pancakes
With that one and gin party makes
She having all the ways good contacts
She making with Apple an contract

[Chorus]
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party
What a shame mary jane
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party
What a shame mary jane
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party
What a shame mary jane had a pain at the party
