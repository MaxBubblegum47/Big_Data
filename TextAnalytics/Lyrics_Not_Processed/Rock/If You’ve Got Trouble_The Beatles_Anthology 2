[Chorus 1]
If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me (Oh oh)

[Chorus 2]
You're quite contend to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just because you're trouble
Then don't bring your troubles to me

[Verse]
I don't think it's funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamond and rings (Oh oh)
You think I'm soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
It's not so funny
When you know what money can bring

[Chorus 3]
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two

[Chours 1]

[Chorus 2]
(Ah rock on, anybody)

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
