[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, you've been good to me
You made me glad
When I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl

[Verse 2]
I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love
I know little girl
Only a fool would doubt our love
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl

[Bridge]
Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do (Way that you do)
That's the kind of love
That is too good to be true
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, you've been good to me
You made me glad
When I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl


[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
