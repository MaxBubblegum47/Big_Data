[Intro: Paul McCartney]
1, 2, 3, 4!

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, she was just 17, if you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another? (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there
