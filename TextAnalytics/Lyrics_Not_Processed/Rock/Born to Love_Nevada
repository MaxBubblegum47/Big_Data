[Intro]
I can't look around the world no more
I feel a daze
Oh my reaction to this world it makes me go insane

[Pre-Chorus]
You know the sun goes down, the days go by
I won't be livin' for nothin'
No, I'll be livin' for something
And if the sun goes down and the days run dry
Will we be dyin' for nothin'
Or dyin' for somethin'?

[Chorus]
Everywhere we go
Cities high and low
We all need to show
We got love yeah
People of all kinds
Places far and wide
We all need to know
We were born to love

[Verse 1]
You can roam around this crazy world all that you want
But the chance of finding what you're looking for is slim to none

[Pre-Chorus]
You know the sun goes down, the days go by
I won't be livin' for nothin'
No, I'll be livin' for something
And if the sun goes down and the days run dry
Will we be dyin' for nothin'
Or dyin' for somethin'?

[Verse 2]
Yeah we makin' moves
No time to lose
Gotta show 'em what we all about
Don't know about you
But I know about me
And boy, I got no doubt
We can change the world
With just one word
I believe it so should you
L to the O-V-E is what we really need
I can feel it breakin' through

[Chorus]
Everywhere we go
Cities high and low
We all need to show
We got love yeah
People of all kinds
Places far and wide
We all need to know
We were born to love

[Verse 3]
It can break through all the static
There's no doubt about it
It can open up your eyes and bring you back to life
Back to life
It can break through all the static (static)
There's no doubt about it (no doubt about it)
It can open up your eyes and bring you back to life
Back to life (back to life)
We were born to love

[Chorus]
Everywhere we go
Cities high and low
We all need to show
We got love yeah
People of all kinds
Places far and wide
We all need to know
(It can break through all the static)
(There's no doubt about it)
We were born to love
We were born to love
