[Verse 1]
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around, 'cause I'm not free
Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah

[Bridge 1]
I wanna tell you, pretty baby
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you
But, darling, I'm imprisoned by these

[Verse 1]
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah

[Bridge 2]
Please believe me when I tell you
Your lips are sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all of these

[Verse 1]
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah

[Outro]
Chains, chains of love
Chains of love
Chains of love
