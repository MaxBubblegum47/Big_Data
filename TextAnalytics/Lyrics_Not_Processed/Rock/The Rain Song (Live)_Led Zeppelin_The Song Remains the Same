[Verse 1]
It is the springtime of my lovin'
This second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growin'
So little warmth I felt before
Ahhh, it isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low
Ah, ho oh oh
Ah, ho oh oh, ahh oh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes, hohh
It is to you I give this tune
It isn't hard to recognize, ho-oh-oh
These things are clear
To all from time to time, oh-hohh

[Verse 3]
Talk, talk to me, talk to me
Now listen
I felt the coldness of my winter, ooh ooh, yeah-e-yeah
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us
But I know a-that I love you so
Ohhhh yeah, an' it feels good, it feels good now
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the wind they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
An' people this is the mystery of the quotient
Upon us all, ohhhh a little rain must fall
Juh- juh- juh- just a little rain ohh, yeah I know
Ahhhhhh
