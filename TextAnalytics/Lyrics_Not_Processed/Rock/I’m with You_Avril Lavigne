[Verse 1]
I'm standin' on the bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening, but there's no sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you, mmm

[Verse 2]
I'm lookin' for a place
I'm searchin' for a face
Is anybody here I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, why is everything so confusing?
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand, take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand, take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I

[Outro]
I'm with you, oh
I'm with you
I'm with you
