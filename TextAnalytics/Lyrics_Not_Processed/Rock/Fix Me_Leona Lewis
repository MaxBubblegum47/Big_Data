[Intro Leona Lewis]
I think I can fix you...
I am lost, can't find my way
You were gone, when im awake
(if youâ€™re there, I will feel for you)
I just need to numb the pain

[Hook/hook Leona Lewis]
Will you fix me,
 will you show me how to breathe
Before all is gone and all my hope is lost, baby
Will you fix me, will you give me what I need
I love you

[Ricky hil verse]
When im lost, can't find my way
And when it's lost, it finds me someway
And when im gone, im gone away
And when its gone, its gone a ways
I never knew that but I think I know now
Ill never get back what I use to throw out
Im alone and it's real but I don't know now
My heart is all my I have and my brains wearing out

[Hook/hook Leona and Ricky]
Will you fix me, will you show me how to breathe
Before all is gone and all my hope is lost, baby
Will you fix me, will you give me what I need
I love you
Oh oh a oh oh oh oh
Oh oh a oh oh oh oh
Oh oh a oh oh oh oh
