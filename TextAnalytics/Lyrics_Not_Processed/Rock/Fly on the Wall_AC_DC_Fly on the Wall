Trapped

[Verse 1]
You can dance through the night
Rock 'n' roll music itching to fight
Making love drunk or stoned
Looking for dollars, get broken-boned
It's a game too tough to tame
Ends up the same, sweating out rain

[Chorus]
I was trapped like a fly on the wall
I was caged like a zoo animal
No escape from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
Watch out, there's a fly on the wall

[Verse 2]
Take a chance, take a bite
Rock roll devil take me tonight
Like a bitch making heat
Beatin' on my chest, licking at my feet
It's a game too tough to tame
Ending up the same, sweating in the rain
So watch out there's a fly on the wall

[Chorus][x2]
