[Chorus]
I remember late nights tryna get my cake right
Bitch I’m like a plane cuz on them suckas we gon’ take flight
Now I got my bag now, why the fuck they mad now?
I been in the booth, they like “where the fuck you at?” now

[Verse]
I remember late nights steady out here workin’
Diamonds on my neck and they be dancing like they twerkin’
Staying in my own lane, never ever swervin’
Raised up in the 90 shit I’m loyal to my surface
Now I’m coming up now
Now they say wassup now
Everywhere I’m going, they just wanna show me love now
Say she love the bankrol, want me for my pesos
20, 50, 100’s they be looking like a rainbow
I remember old days, she ain’t really like me
Now she wanna fall in love, she tryna be my wifey
Rockin’ on my lonely, I ain’t acting phony
Scorin’ like I’m Kobe, I do this for my homies

[Chorus]
I remember late nights tryna get my cake right
Bitch I’m like a plane cuz on them suckas we gon’ take flight
Now I got my bag now, why the fuck they mad now?
I been in the booth, they like “where the fuck you at?” now
