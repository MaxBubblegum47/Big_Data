[Intro]
Yeah, oh
Yeah, you know
You know, you know
Aha, I'm full it
Ayy, I'm in the booth
Huh, ayy
Shout out Bobby Johnson (Yeah), ayy

[Verse 1]
Found myself in the dark place
Last girl made my heart ache
Now I'm tryna get my soul back (Yeah)
Why all y'all fake flex?
Mama told me never take shit
So, I never really take shit
I don't care what you rep, bro
Ex-bitch doing BangBros
Wow, I really shoulda kept her
Really shoulda kept your mouth closed
I've been runnin' out of ammo
Different state, little trap, woah
Every city with a bad ho

[Chorus]
Satan's got a grip on me
Heaven's looking very bleak
 (Woah)
Steal my faith in everything
 (Woah)
Eating off that apple tree
Sunlight shining every beam
 (Yeah)
Gloomy days, you scaring me
 (Ayy)
All my friends are enemies
All my friends are enemies
All my friends are enemies
All my friends are ene- yeah
All my friends are ene- yeah

[Verse 2]
Windows tinted, you can't see us in it (Woah)
Prescription pills made me a villain (Yeah)
Never busy, man, I'm always chillin' (Yeah, yeah)
Fake friends up in the grass
Gotta keep it low, let the snakes pass
My main girl gotta side door
Like my bitch, got more hoes
Insane though, she a crazy ho, yeah

[Chorus]
Friends gon' turn to enemies
Satan's got a grip on me
Heaven's looking very bleak
Steal my faith in everything
Eating off that apple tree
Sunlight shining every beam
Gloomy days, you scaring me
All my friends are enemies

[Outro]
All my friends are enemies
All my friends are enemies
All my friends are ene- yeah
Out the booth, bitch
