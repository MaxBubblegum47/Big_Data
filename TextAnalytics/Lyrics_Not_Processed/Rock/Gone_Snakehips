[Verse 1: Syd]
Champagne in my glass, polo on my shirt
New girl in my lap, she just got to work
She put on a show, keep it on the low
Just throw her a little dough, she get on the fours
She said "if you need that, I got it babe"
And I can put you on if you got it babe
Mango kush and orange juice, that tropical
I can take you to the spot if you want to smoke

[Pre-Hook: Syd]
Next thing I know I'm
In and out the zone
I'm gone, so gone
Babe, you got me there I'm
Floating in the air
I'm gone, so gone

[Hook: Syd]
Don't know what happened but baby I'm flying
I hope I'm not driving cause then I'd be dying
My body is trying to come back to life
But my mind is so left I can't get with the right
Cause I'm gone (ayyy)
Cause I'm gone gone (ayyy)
Cause I'm gone(ayyy)
Cause I'm gone gone (ayyy)

[Verse 2: Syd]
I think my drink was laced, now I'm wondering
I can't feel my face and I'm stuttering
Money on the floor, when she drop it low
She go up and down the pole, she outta control
Ice, a little red with a dash of white
Hoping for the feds and the flashing lights
I was on the phone, next thing that I know
She brought the Henny and Patron, we took it home

[Pre-Hook: Syd]
Next thing I know I'm
In and out the zone
I'm gone, so gone
Babe, you got me there I'm
Floating in the air
I'm gone, so gone

[Hook: Syd]
[Don't know what happened but baby I'm flying
I hope I'm not driving cause then I'd be dying
My body is trying to come back to life
But my mind is so left I can't get with the right
Cause I'm gone (ayyy)
Cause I'm gone gone (ayyy)
Cause I'm gone(ayyy)
Cause I'm gone gone (ayyy)

[Bridge: Syd]
I'm lost in dimensions
I'm out of resistance
I'm stuck on the planet
My body is sinking
It's higher and higher
And higher and higher

[Bridge: Syd]
[I'm lost in dimensions
I'm out of resistance
I'm stuck on the planet
My body is sinking
It's higher and higher
And higher and higher

[Outro: Syd]
Cause I'm gone (ayyy)
Cause I'm gone gone (ayyy)
Cause I'm gone(ayyy)
Cause I'm gone gone (ayyy)
Cause I'm gone (ayyy)
Cause I'm gone gone (ayyy)
Cause I'm gone (ayyy)
Cause I'm gone gone (ayyy)
(yeah, yeah)
