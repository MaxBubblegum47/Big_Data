[Instrumental intro 0:00-1:17]

[Verse 1]
Lying, cheating, hurting, that's all you seem to do
Messing around with every guy in town
Putting me down for thinking of someone new
Always the same, playing your game
Drive me insane, trouble is gonna come to you
One of these days and it won't be long
You'll look for me but, baby, I'll be gone
This is all I gotta say to you, woman

[Chorus]
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come

[Verse 2]
Made up my mind to break you this time
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry
Do what you want, I won't take the brunt
It's fading away, can't feel you anymore
Don't care what you say cause I'm going away to stay
Going to make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
People talking all around
Watch out woman, no longer
Is the joke gonna be on my heart
You been bad to me woman
But it's coming back home to you

[Chorus]
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
