[Verse 1]
Steam is a-burning
Rocking up and down the line
The pot is getting ready
He's been working it so hard
When it comes to loving
Big jack is on his way
Wink of satisfaction
His time is coming on

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm like a bad defender
Smoking holy joe
He's a big pretender
Look out for jack
He's on his way

[Chorus]
Big Jack, Big Jack
You know it's only natural he gets you up to scratch
Big Jack, Big Jack
He got a reputation, he really got the knack
Big Jack, Big Jack
Santa ain't the only one who's got a full sack
Big Jack
Look out, Jack
He's always got your back




[Verse 2]
He never leave a dollar
Racking up the balls
He like to get it on fast
Back there standing tall
When he hears the siren
He's gonna to put you on the racks
He got a bad reputation
Climbing on all over the bars

[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna press the flesh
Rock and rollin' soldier
He's the last of them all
We'll tell Jack
He's on his way

[Chorus]
Big Jack, Big Jack
You know it's only natural to get you up to scratch
Big Jack, Big Jack
Always into trouble, coppers turn the other way
Big Jack, Big Jack
Always likes to party and he likes the girls to play
Big Jack
Look out, Jack
He always got your back




[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Big Jack, Big Jack
You know it's only natural to get you up to scratch
Big Jack, Big Jack
You've got a reputation, really got the knack
Big Jack, Big Jack
Santa ain't the only one who's got a full sack
Big Jack
Look out, Jack
Ain't no need to worry, he's always got your back
