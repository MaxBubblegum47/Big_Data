[Part 1: SISTER]

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Drink of the apple pie with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't got no chains in my denim, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't listen what the blogs tell me, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know niggas got their own agenda, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Joba]
I've got [censored], but you would never know
I like to hide them, so much I lose myself
That's why I'm pure to some, a psychopath to others
And grew up in counseling, flipping off my counselors
They gave me mood stabilizers
But when I came off 'em, I was violent
Took the drugs that I wanted, which didn't help with the voices
They just grew louder and louder
Like all the people who'd just chatter and chatter
I juggle all my personalities

[Interlude: Robert Ontenient]
Estoy tan harto y cansado, no puedo seguir haciendo esto
Ojalá pudiera rendirme pero tengo que seguir siendo fuerte para mi familia y mis amigos

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I found myself getting better by the fucking minute
'Member when my momma always had to save the minutes
Got some D's, dropped out, wanted to be Russell Simmons
Gotta keep workin', my head on Innervisions
Where the kitchen at? Keep the lyrics written
Raid my cell and dope, askin' for forgiveness
I just ran into somebody sellin' lemonade
Kiss your kids tonight before them bitches run away

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
This for all my broke niggas, this for all them jokes, nigga
That you niggas made when I was still livin' at home, nigga
Did it on my own, nigga, grew up and I bossed out
Grew up and I bossed out, grew up and I bossed out

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I see you peekin’ through bushes
And tryna get secret ingredients from us
I know that you do it 'cause you see us boomin'
Like C4 when you hit that detonator
Lucky-lucky on the elevator
Eat my dust, baby, I’ll see ya later
I could always call your bluff
You already said enough
Take a risk, bitch
Still sittin' on your ass, waitin' for a handout
Giving nothin', put your hands down
"Ooh, yeah, this for the culture!"
"Ooh, yeah, this important!"
Fuck off with that slang shit
Fuck off with that networking
Keep your mouth where the money at

[Bridge: Dom McLennon]
Yellow lights on my dashboard
Red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset
But all I wanna do is see you
You know that lately I don't think straight
But I don't really know what I'm doing now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up
I'm struggling while on the move now
Yellow lights on my dashboard
Red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset
But all I wanna do is heal you
You know that lately I don't think straight
But lately I don't know what to do now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up
I'm struggling while on the move now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred  bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

[Part 2: NATION]

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Barely got control of it, must've got a hold of it
Threw me to the ground and left a scar right on my nigga-lips
I look in my closet when I think about the past life
Never good in my wallet, tryna see if I got my cash right
Fuck a flight, they ain't never wanna treat my bag right
Fuck a job, they ain't never treat my mom and dad right

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I hate them quiet suburbs, I hate those picket fences
I hate the separation, first thing they called me; "Nigga"
I fight, I got suspended, my teachers saw me hit him
So they ain't listen to me, and from that moment on
I would learn that I was different, I would grow to see the difference
Second-guessing my decisions, Black bodies come up missing

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I would walk through the halls at my own pace
Every lunch, I would flow, having no place
All the books in my bag 'til my bones ache
Wonder how the world would be if I had no face
If I had no heart, if I had no skin
And I was just thoughts, reminiscing
The things I always brushed off
Had my father try to tell me I was just soft
And when I look at the things that I've been through
And the things I survived, and at what cost?
All the love in my life that I just lost
All this shit persevere to the pole vault
In the lies of the law, I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm a icon
In the eyes of my own, I ain't start yet
In the eyes of the law, I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm a icon
In the eyes that I own, I ain't start yet, I ain't start yet

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Power, African power!
Power, African power!
Power, African power!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
Ugh, I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
