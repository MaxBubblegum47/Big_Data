[Verse 1]
Motor cars, handle bars
Bicycles for two
Broken hearted jubilee
Parachutes, army boots
Sleeping bags for two
[Mumbling] â€”boree

[Chorus]
[Mumbling]

[Verse 2]
Motor cars, handle bars
Bicycles for two
Broken hearted jubilee
Parachutes, army boots
Sleeping bags for you
[Mumbling] jamboree

[Chorus]
[Mumbling]
[Mumbling] shop window
Why? Why?
Says the junk in the yard

[Chorus]
Buy! Buy!
Says the sign in the shop window
Why? Why?
Says the junk in the yard

[Instrumental/Scat]
