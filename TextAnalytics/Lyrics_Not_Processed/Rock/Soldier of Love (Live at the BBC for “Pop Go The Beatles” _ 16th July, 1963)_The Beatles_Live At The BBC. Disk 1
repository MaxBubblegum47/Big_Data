[Chorus]
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And surrender to me (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms for loving me
Baby, that's the way it's got to be (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
There is no reason for you to declare
War on the one that loves you so
So forget the other boys because my love is real
Come off your battlefield

[Chorus]
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me tenderly (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't want to fight no more (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
The weapons you're using are hurting me bad
But someday you're going to see
That my love for you baby, is the truest you've ever had
A Soldier of Love, that's hard to be

[Chorus]
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And love me peacefully (Sha la, la)
Lay down your arms (Soldier of love)
And surrender to me (Sha la, la) yeah (Sha la la)
Use your arms to squeeze and please because I'm the one that loves you so
(Yeah, soldier of love) Baby, lay down your arms
(Yeah, soldier of love) Baby, lay down your arms
(Yeah, yeah) (fade out)
