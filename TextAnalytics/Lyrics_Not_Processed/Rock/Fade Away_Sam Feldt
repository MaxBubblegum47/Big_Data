[Verse 1]
Take it slowly
'Cause it feels like time has got something to show me
Through a crowded room, look at me like you know me
Ain't it funny how a second lasts forever
When we're together

[Pre-Chorus]
And I-I-I might get enough one day
But I-I-I won't let this feeling fade away

[Chorus]
I know it won't stop if we turn our love up
Why should we change? We were amazing yesterday
Remove the pressure and if it's meant forever
I'll make you stay, don't let this feeling fade away

[Post-Chorus]
Won't let this feeling fade away

[Verse 2]
Don't you hurry
I will show you all the treasures that I buried
Try to hide but you just always see right through me
Sometimes I feel like giving up but you're the reason
That I'm not leavin'

[Chorus]
I know it won't stop if we turn our love up
Why should we change? We were amazing yesterday
Remove the pressure and if it's meant forever
I'll make you stay, don't let this feeling fade away

[Post-Chorus]
Won't let this feeling fade away

[Chorus]
I know it won't stop if we turn our love up
Why should we change? We were amazing yesterday
Remove the pressure and if it's meant forever
I'll make you stay, don't let this feeling fade away
