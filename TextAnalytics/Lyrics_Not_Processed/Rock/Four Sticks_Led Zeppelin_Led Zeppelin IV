[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, it's crying time
Oh, baby, I got to fly
Got to try to find a way
Got to try to get away
'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, babe

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, the river's red
Ah, baby, in my head
There's a funny feeling going on
I don't think I can hold out long

[Chorus]
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the rivers run dry, baby, how would you feel?

[Verse 3]
Craze, baby, the rainbow's end
Mm, baby, it's just a den for those who hide
Who hide their love to depths of life
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe

[Chorus]
And when the owls cry in the night
And baby, when the pines begin to cry
Oh, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the rivers run dry, baby, how do you feel?
Ah, ah...
Baby, how do you feel?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Ooh yeah, brave I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
They can't hold the wrath of those who walk
And the boots of those who march
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah
