[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Everybody wanna be a star (okay)
Everybody wanna be real (for sure)
All I wanted was to be a king (okay)
Give the people something they can feel (for sure)
I don't really got a lot of time (okay)
Got a lot of birds I need to kill (for sure)
Not enough stones in my hand (okay)
That's because I like what's in the deal
So I gotta deal with it, accordingly
Stars aligning my hands now
You create your own reality
Just gotta understand the circumstances now
I roll a leaf around a couple grams
Yeah I know I ain't perfect but I gotta plan now
I like to roll around in my problems before I burn 'em down
Burn 'em down
So don't judge me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
All I ever wanted was a dad (okay)
All I ever wanted was a slab (for sure)
All I ever wanted was some grills (okay)
All I ever wanted was a bitch (for sure)
All I ever wanted was respect (okay)
All I ever wanted was a gun (for sure)
All I ever wanted was some BAPE (okay)
All I ever wanted was some braids
All I ever wanted was the fame
All I ever wanted was a sidekick
All I ever wanted was some wealth
All I ever wanted was a Pocket Rocket
All I ever wanted was Rihanna
All I ever wanted was a MySpace
All I ever wanted was a MacBook
All I ever wanted was a family

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them

[Outro: Joba]
Things I never had
Made me who I am
These things I never had
Made me who I am
I hate myself
Said I hate myself
The things I never had
Made me who I am
These things I never had
Made me who I am
Things I never had
These things I never had
Made me who I am
