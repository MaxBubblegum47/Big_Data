[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: GoldLink]
Push out your back, put ya butt in it
Wanna love you, but I do not wanna commit
So I dance with ya with the thought of us fuckin'
We dancin' up in the corner, 
feelin' for the corner pockets
So I ease your work for just a bit, uh
Buy your drink, you have a sip, uh
Then I tell you we should dip
You grabbin' me close and closer 'til you get a kiss
Push up your bra to the left, that's right
Now we in a car with a broke brake light
Thinkin' 'bout the ass, the legs, the head, the sex
The whip, 
the figure-four leg lock
, then we dip out

[Chorus: Jay Prince & 
GoldLink

You say you wanna party all day (
Mhm, uh-huh

You say you needed lovin' from me
You say you wanna party all day (
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You say you needed (
Yeah, yeah

So why waste time? (

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & 
Jay Prince
]
Ayo, your boyfriend pissed off, smackin' his lips off
The fact my lips are covered in your lip gloss
I say we should dip off out of here
Talk, speak, share some words, grab a ear
Nah, you can't take off, unless you leave your amigo
Swallow your pride and put aside your ego
Man, fuck bein' modest, I'm just bein' honest
You seem home-cooked and them goods McDonald's (Yeah)
But no, the bid is off (Woo)
Niggas always dip and they duck the sauce (Yeah)
Rocks on my neck, I don't know the cost (Nah)
Car out front like the Uber, Uber (Skrrt)
We can hop in, and you can top ten
The list that I wanted to hop in (Wait)
List is full, so I'ma call it a night (Ahh)
And you ain't even my type
I'm all bark, no bite, I'm so sorry (
You say you wanna
)
Wasted time, I wasted time
Why you dutty wine, it's whatever (Yeah, 
you say
)
You sweatin' drips upon my sweater (My sweater)
It's hot in here, the outside's better (Yeah)
I'm leavin', leavin', you call me back, it's like emotions recedin'
Let's call it a evenin', it's gettin' desperate, yeah

[Chorus: Jay Prince & 
Tyler, the Creator
]
So why waste time?
You say you wanna party all day
You say you needed lovin' fromâ€“ (
