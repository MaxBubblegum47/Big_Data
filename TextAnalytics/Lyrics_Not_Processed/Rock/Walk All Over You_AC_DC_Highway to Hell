[Verse 1]
Out of my way, I'm a-running high
Take a chance with me and a-give it a try
Ain't no woman in the world don't know
'Cause I ain't looking for overflow
Oh baby, I ain't got much
Resistance to your touch
Take off the high heels, let down your hair

[Pre-Chorus]
Paradise ain't far from there

[Chorus]
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to, baby
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you

[Verse 2]
Reflections on the bedroom wall
And, there, you thought you'd seen it all
We're rising, falling like the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
You're looking so good, under me

[Chorus]
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to, to you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you

[Verse 3]
Moanin', groanin', stirrin' it up
So, gimme the stage, I'm gonna steal the show
Leave on the lace and turn off the light

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight is gonna be that night

[Chorus]
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to, baby
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you
