[Verse 1]
Shower in the dark day
Clean sparks driving down
Cool in the waterway
Where the baptized drown
Naked in the cold sun
Breathing life like fire
Thought I was the only one
But that was just a lie

[Chorus]
Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
And I thought it was the 4th of July

[Verse 2]
Pale in the flare light
The scared light cracks & disappears
And leads the scorched ones here
And everywhere no one cares
The fire is spreading
And no one wants to speak about it
Down in the hole
Jesus tries to crack a smile
Beneath another shovel load

[Chorus]
I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
And I thought it was the 4th of July
I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
And I thought it was the 4th of July (July, July)

[Verse 3]
Now I'm in control
Now I'm in the fall out
Once asleep but now I stand
And I still remember
Your sweet everything
Light a Roman candle
And hold it in your hand

[Chorus]
Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
And I thought it was the 4th of July
I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
And I thought it was the 4th of July
Yeahhhhhh
