[Verse 1]
Nobody going to take my car
I'm going to race it to the ground
Nobody going to beat my car
It's going to break the speed of sound
Ooh, it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power
Big fat tires and everything

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it
And I need it
I bleed it
Yeah, it's a wild hurricane

[Chorus]
Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star

[Verse 2]
Nobody going to take my girl
I'm going to keep her to the end
Nobody going to have my girl
She stays close on every bend
Ooh, she's a killing machine
She's got everything
Like a moving mouth
Body control and everything

[Pre-Chorus]
I love her
I need her
I see her
Yeah, she turns me on

[Chorus]
Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star

[Instrumental break 1:54-3:04]
[Organ Solo]

[Verse 3]
Nobody going to take my head
I got speed inside my brain
Nobody going to steal my head
Now that I'm on the road again
Ooh, I'm in heaven again
I've got everything
Like a moving ground
An open road and everything

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it
And I need it
I seed it
Eight cylinders, all mine

[Chorus]
Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star

[Instrumental break 3:42-5:05]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Nobody going to take my car
I'm going to race it to the ground
Nobody going to beat my car
It's going to break the speed of sound
Ooh, it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power
Big fat tires and everything

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it
And I need it
I bleed it
Yeah, it's a mad hurricane

[Chorus]
Alright, hold tight
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
