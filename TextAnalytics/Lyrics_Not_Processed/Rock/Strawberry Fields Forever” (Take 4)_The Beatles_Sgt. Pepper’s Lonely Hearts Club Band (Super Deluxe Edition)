[Chorus 1]
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

[Verse 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Verse 2]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus 2]
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

[Verse 3]
Always know sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean, ah yes
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus 3]
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
