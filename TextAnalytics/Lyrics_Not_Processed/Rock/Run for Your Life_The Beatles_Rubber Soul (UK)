[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Outro: John Lennon]
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
