[Verse 1]
If you're leaving, close the door
I'm not expecting people, anymore
Hear me grieving, lying on the floor
Whether I'm drunk or dead
I really ain't too sure

[Chorus]
I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
And my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
There ain't a sadder tale

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Had a friend once, in a room
Had a good time
But it ended much too soon
In a cold month, in that room
We found a reason
For the things we had to do

[Chorus]
I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
Now my room is cold
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
He feels it from his soul
