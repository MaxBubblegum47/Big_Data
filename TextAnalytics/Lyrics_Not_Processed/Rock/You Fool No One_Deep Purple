[Chorus]
You fool no one, waiting to see if I'm gone
So hard to see, you are taking your chances with me
If I find you with some other man, you know what I'm going to do
Better run if you see me coming, ah

[Verse]
Soon you will fall, making mistakes like before
When you tell me lies, I can see by the look in your eyes
If you think you're going to take me for granted
Chasing round with all you see, going to make you live to regret it, ah!

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
You fool no one, waiting to see if I'm gone
So clear to see, you've had all your chances with me
You thought that you could take me for granted
But I couldn't take it no more, better run when you see me coming, ah
