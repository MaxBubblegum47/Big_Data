[Verse 1]
You paint a picture, so it's plain to see
Ain't no hidin', no security
I'll be watchin' every move you make
When you hear my rattle, better be awake

[Chorus]
Snake eyes, watchin'
Snake eyes, look out
Snake eyes, oh, it's comin'
Snake eyes
Ain't no escaping from the snake eye

No way

[Verse 2]
You leave a footprint for my eye to see
Catch an echo from a lock and key
From the shadow, or behind a rock
Get your anti-venom from the doctor's cup

[Chorus]
Snake eyes, I'm watchin'
Snake eyes, look out
Snake eyes, ooh, it's comin'
Snake eyes
Ain't no escaping from the snake eye

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Snake eyes
Snake eyes, ooh
That snake eye
Snake eyes

[Verse 3]
Hear a rustle from behind a tree
Get you runnin' home to sanctuary
Bolt the door, and you think you're safe?
Ha-ha, ha-ha
Wrong again, child!

[Chorus]
Snake eye, watchin'
Snake eyes, oh, look out
Snake eyes, it's coming
Snake eyes, ooh
They got the snake eye
Ain't no escaping from the snake eye
Ooh, like my snake eye, always watchin'
Snake eye
Ain't no escaping from the
Just keep a look out for the
Snake eye
