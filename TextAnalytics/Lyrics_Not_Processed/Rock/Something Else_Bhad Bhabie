[Chorus]
Not that I wanted him, but then I saw his friend
I want something else
Not that I want the bands, then I see [?]
That's on something else
She got a lot of cash, that’s a whole lot of ass
She's something else
She got a lot of bitches, that's a whole lot of inches
They something else
On something else
On something else
Not that I wanted him, but then I saw his friend
I want something else
Not that I want the bands, then I see [?]
That’s on something else

[Verse]
He wanna floor the bitch, I skrrt off and floor this shit
I pull up and pop a bitch, just to show I'm on that shit
You bitches ain't seeing me, your man wanna feel on me
No wonder that luxury, but I cost a couple G's
Nah fuck that, I cost a couple keys
Bhabie don't play around, I pull up and shut it down (You hearing me)
Might make [?] couple pounds, and a whole lotta rounds (You hearing me)
We on that fuck shit, we pull up and bust shit (You hearing me)
I'm not a 'lil dumb bitch, you know that I run shit (You hearing me)

[Chorus]
Not that I wanted him, but then I saw his friend
I want something else
Not that I want the bands, then I see [?]
That's on something else
She got a lot of cash, plus a whole lot of ass
She’s something else
She got a lot of bitches, that’s a whole lot of inches
They something else
On something else
On something else
Not that I wanted him, but then I saw his friend
I want something else
Not that I want the bands, then I see [?]
That's on something else
Pew, pew, pew
