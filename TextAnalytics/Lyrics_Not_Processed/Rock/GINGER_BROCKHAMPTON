[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together
And  you know you got your own space right here forever, baby
You  know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together (My own session)
And  you know you got your own space right here forever, baby (And my own blessing)
Know  you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own
Know  you got your own shit, and all of it together (My own session)
And you know you got your own space right here forever, babe (And my own blessing)
Know you got your own, know you got your own
I know you got your own, I know you got your own

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Ayy,  stay sound when you not around
Mood is always better whenever you not around
Fuckin' up the weather and you fuckin' up my town
Fuckin' up a sweater and I'm fuckin' up a gown
Look at how I'm shinin' though
Look at how I'm smilin' though
Look at how I'm smilin'
Look at how I'm wildin', and I'm still broke, uh
You still think I'm a joke, uh, I still think I'm a joke, uh
I still think it ain't gon' work out
Nigga that shit is broke, broke, broke, broke

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Tell me, goddamn, what God made me for?
I don't even love no more
I don't even trust no more
I don't need to clutch no more
Some things outside of my control
I need some space, I need to grow
So I go, plague my soul
Say I won't
I never tried to let you go so deep, deep, deep, deep

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together (My own session)
And you know you got your own space right here forever, baby (And my own blessing)
Know you got your own, know you got your own
Know you got your own, know you, know you got your own
Know you got your own shit, and all of it together (My own session)
And you know you got your own space right here forever, baby (And my own blessing)
You know you got your own, know you got your own
I know you got your own know you got your own

[Verse 3: bearface]
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind

[Interlude: Dom McLennon & bearface]
I don't wanna take this ride
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white
Pull out your mind

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
