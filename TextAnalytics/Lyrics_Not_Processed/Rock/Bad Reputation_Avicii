[Verse 1]
Can you see my emotion
Sinking away in slow motion?
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea
Can you see my emotion
Say, can you see my devotion?
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea

[Chorus]
I hear what you're saying, I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying for a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me, I know
I got a bad reputation

[Verse 2]
I know that you've been talking
You never see me sleepwalking
Drifting out into nothing
Rolling away in my dreams
Can you feel that I'm falling?
Laying awake till the morning
Every word that I'm calling
Just getting lost out at sea

[Chorus]
I hear what you're saying, I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying for a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me, I know
I got a bad reputation
I got a bad reputation

[Bridge]
So, you got me figured out
Know what I'm all about
I'm all about dollars and green
Don't care about nothing but me
You got me figured out
You know what I'm all about
Don't care about nothing but me, yeah

[Chorus]
I hear what you're saying, I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying for a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me, I know
I got a bad reputation
I got a bad reputation
