[Verse 1: Janelle Monae]
Tick-tock, I'm watching the clock
I can't wait til we get to rock
I wanna scream and dream and throw a love parade
Is that okay?
Tonight is me and you alone
Won't make a call, won't even write a song
See I've been waiting and waiting for the time to say
Now listen babe

[Pre-Chorus: Janelle Monae]
When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you've given your all
Baby our love will always keep it real and true

[Chorus: Janelle Monae]
Cause baby it's a prime time for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a prime time for our love
And heaven is betting on us

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Bang bang, I'm calling your name
You're like a fire the world can't tame
I wanna riot til the stars come out and play
Is that okay? Okay
Tonight is me and you alone
Won't take a call, won't even write a song
This'll be a personal holiday
Listen baby

[Pre-Chorus 2: Miguel]
When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you've given your all
Baby my love is always right here for you
Yeah

[Chorus: Janelle Monae & Miguel]
Cause baby it's a prime time for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a prime time for our love
And heaven is betting on us
Cause baby it's a prime time for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a prime time for our love
And heaven is betting on us

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Janelle Monae]
I know sometimes I’m mysterious
And you’re mysterious too
But tonight, I don't wanna be mysterious with you

[Chorus until Fade: Janelle Monae & Miguel]
Cause baby it's a prime time for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a prime time for our love
And heaven is betting on us
