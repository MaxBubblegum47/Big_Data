I think this is a song of hope

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
And when she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Oohoohooh oohoohoohoohooh
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird that sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
And I think you can see that
Ohh

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder, sure does
Oh hoh hoh, hohooh ohoohohooh, yes sir

[Verse 2]
There's a feelin' I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Ah hah. Ah hah
Ah hah. Ah hah. Ahhhahhohoohohooh

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
Does anybody remember laughter?
Baby! Oh, baby look...
Just give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Sure does, sure does
But I got some good news, listen...

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
I hope so
Oohh! Baby, baby, baby
Ya, darlin' babe
Ya, darlin' babe
Ya, darlin' babe
Wait a minute...

[Verse 5]
Your head is hummin' and it won't go in case ya don't know
The piper's callin' you to join him
Dear Lady, can you hear the wind blow and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whisperin' wind?
Ohh hah hahhahhh

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our souls
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold, yeah
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all is one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll, not to roll

[Outro]
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
Ahhahhhhohhahhoh
