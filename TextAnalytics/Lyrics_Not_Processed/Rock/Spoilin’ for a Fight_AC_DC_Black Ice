I see trouble coming later

[Verse 1]
Well I'm coming to a boil
Sliding, going rogue
From a lift, come on down
We're going to roll right out
I'm a fighting fool
And I'm hungry for you
Well I'm living on the line, yeah
'Bout to take the money

[Pre-Chorus]
Rock with me
Come on, come on
You're only

[Chorus]
Spoiling for a fight
Spoiling for a fight
Spoiling for a fight
Spoiling for a fight, spoiling for a fight, spoiling for a fight

[Verse 2]
Make your heartbeat thump
And make your starter jump, yeah
You're a rock and rolling time, yeah
And then you're fightin' all night
With my rockin' shoes
'Cause I'm hungry for you
Well I'm living on the line
All my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Rock with me
Come on, come on
You're only

[Chorus]
Spoiling for a fight
Spoiling for a fight
Trying to make it right
Spoiling for a fight, spoiling for a fight
Trying to make it right

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
You'd better stand your ground
And keep out of my town
Fight to live another day
Oh yeah
Come on
Step off

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Fighting all night
'Cause I'm spoiling for a fight
