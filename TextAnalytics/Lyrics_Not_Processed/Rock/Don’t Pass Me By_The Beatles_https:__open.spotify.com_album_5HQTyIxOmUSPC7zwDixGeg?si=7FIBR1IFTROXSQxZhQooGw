I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
I listen for your footsteps but they don't arrive
I'm waiting for your knock dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?
I hear the clock a ticking, on the mantle shelf
I see the hands a moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
Why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
Caus you know dalring, I love only you
You never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
But you were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
Caus you know darling, I love only you
You never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
Caus you know darling, I love only you
You never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
Caus you know darling, I love only you
You never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me cry
