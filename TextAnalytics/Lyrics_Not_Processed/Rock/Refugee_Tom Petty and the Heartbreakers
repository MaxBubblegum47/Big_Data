[Verse 1]
We got somethin', we both know it
We don't talk too much about it
Ain't no real big secret all the same
Somehow we get around it

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen, it don't really matter to me, baby
You believe what you want to believe

[Chorus]
You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)

[Verse 2]
Somewhere, somehow, somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Tell me why you wanna lay there
And revel in your abandon

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, it don't make no difference to me, baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free

[Chorus]
You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No baby, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)

[Bridge]
Baby, we ain't the first
I'm sure a lot of other lovers been burned
Right now this seems real to you
But it's one of those things
You got to feel to be true

[Verse 3]
Somewhere, somehow, somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Who knows, maybe you were kidnapped
Tied up, taken away, and held for ransom

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, it don't really matter to me, baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free

[Chorus]
You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
You don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
