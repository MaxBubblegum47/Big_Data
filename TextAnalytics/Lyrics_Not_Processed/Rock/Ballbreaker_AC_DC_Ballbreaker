[Verse 1]
Breakin' balls, bangin' walls
Work hard and tough, and I want some rough
Unpack my bags, and take a drag
When bang on nine, and I'm dead on time

[Pre-Chorus]
Open up the door
And lay upon the floor
She open her overcoat
Living out her dreams
Rippin' off my jeans

[Chorus]
You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker

[Verse 2]
Engine roll, and time to go
At razorback, a hog attack
I'm building steam, for whipping cream
She likes a fat smoking stack

[Pre-Chorus]
Hanging off her legs
She threw me on the bed
Her hand went for my throat
As I began to choke
"Honey, shoot your load"

[Chorus]
You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Wrecking ball, let it roll
You are a Ballbreaker
Building steam, for whipping cream
You are a Ballbreaker

[Pre-Chorus]
Hanging off her legs
She threw me on the bed
Her hand went for my throat
As I began to choke
"Honey, shoot your load"

[Chorus]
You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker

[Chorus]
You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker

[Chorus]
You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
