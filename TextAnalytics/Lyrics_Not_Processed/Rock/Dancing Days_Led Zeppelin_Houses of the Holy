[Verse 1]
Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows

[Chorus]
I said it's alright, you know it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

[Verse 2]
Crazy ways are evident
By the way you wearing your clothes
Sipping booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

[Chorus]
You know it's alright, I said it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
Dig

[Verse 3]
You told your mama I'd get you home
But you didn't say that I got no car
I saw a lion, he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar

[Chorus]
You know it's alright
I said it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart, heart
You'll be my only
My one and only
Is that the way it should start?

[Verse 1]
So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman who knows

[Chorus]
I said it's alright
You know it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, yes
My one and only, yes
Is that the way it should start?
I know it is, yeah!
