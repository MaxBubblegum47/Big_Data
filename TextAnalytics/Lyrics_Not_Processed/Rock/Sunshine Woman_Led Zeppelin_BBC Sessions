I've got a baby y'know
She treats me fine
I've got a little woman wanna give me but her
A-give it all the time (? )
(? ) baby
She's nice and kind to me
A-give me breakfast in the mornin' ya know she
Also makes my tea
Let's go!
She got a little diamond
Shine like gold
Got a mortgage on my body
Got a lien on my soul
When my baby walks ya know
Her front teeth they shine like gold, they do
Well-a ya know she shine like diamond
But she got a mortgage on my soul, hah!
Get up, get up, get up
Hah! alright, yeah, ah
My baby when she walks ya know
Shakes just like a willow tree
Yes, my baby when she walks ya know
Shakes just like a willow tree
She so mean and evil
She makes a monkey outta me
Whoah alright
