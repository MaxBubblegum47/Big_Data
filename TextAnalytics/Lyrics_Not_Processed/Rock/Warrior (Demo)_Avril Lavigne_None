[Verse 1]
I'll pick my battles 'cause I know I'm gonna win the war
I'm not rattled 'cause I shouted all of this before
Steadier than steel 'cause I'm ready with my shield and sword (Oh)
Back on the saddle 'cause I gathered all my strength for more (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I won't bow, I won't break
No, I'm not afraid to do whatever it takes
I'll never bow, I'll never break

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m a warrior, I fight for my life
Like a soldier all through the night
And I won’t give up, I will survive, I'm a warrior
And I'm stronger, that's why I'm alive
I will conquer, time after time
I'll never falter, I will survive, I'm a warrior

[Post-Chorus]
Warrior
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm a warrior

[Verse 2]
Like a viking, I'll be fighting through the day and night
I'll be marching through the darkness 'til the morning lights
Even when it's harder, like the armor, you will see me shine (Oh)
No, I won't stop and I won't drop until the victory's mine (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I won't bow, I won't break
No, I'm not afraid to do whatever it takes
I'll never bow, I'll never break

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m a warrior, I fight for my life
Like a soldier all through the night
And I won’t give up, I will survive, I'm a warrior
And I'm stronger, that's why I'm alive
I will conquer, time after time
I'll never falter, I will survive, I'm a warrior, oh

[Bridge]
I don't care, what you want 'cause I'm a warrior
A warrior
I don't know what the hell you are, but I'm a warrior

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m a warrior, I fight for my life
Like a soldier all through the night
And I won’t give up, I will survive, I'm a warrior

[Outro]
Warrior
'Cause I'm a warrior
