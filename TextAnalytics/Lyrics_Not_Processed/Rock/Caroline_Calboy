[Intro: Calboy]
JTK
Boy, you in these, ayy

[Chorus: Calboy]
Boy, you in these streets, better look left and right (Left and right)
'Cause them niggas out here killin', they'll take your life (Take your life)
He killed him, now he out of mind, out of sight (Hey)
Told the gang better focus, boy, ain't no losin' sight (No losin' sight)
Foenem in the kitchen whippin' Caroline (Caroline)
And I'm still ridin' with them felons, right (Ridin' with them felons, right)
Every mornin', we trappin' and then we kill at night (Then we kill at night)
Got addicted to drugs 'cause I wasn't feelin' right

[Verse 1: Polo G]
Thank God for these blessings when I wake up in the mornin'
Prayed through the struggle, now we shinin' in them foreigns
Lil' Blast, that's my brother,
 he on X while I'm performin'
We don't fuck with you, if you ain't gang, you not important
We are not for none, nigga, this a friendly warning
Lil' Duck, he like KD, ainâ€™t no stoppin' him from scorin'
Chopper clappin' loud, got it soundin' like it's stormin'
Like we playin' Operation, rearrange your organs
Fire out that torch gon' leave a pussy nigga scorchin'
Niggas out here snitchin', gotta watch out for informants
Pills got me trippin', I pop X when it get borin'
Now I'm hearin' voices in my head like Randy Orton

[Chorus: Calboy]
Boy, you in these streets, better look left and right (Left and right)
'Cause them niggas out here killin', they'll take your life (Take your life)
He killed him, now he out of mind, out of sight (Hey)
Told the gang better focus, boy, ain't no losin' sight (No losin' sight)
Foenem in the kitchen whippin' Caroline (Caroline)
And I'm still ridin' with them felons, right (Ridin' with them felons, right)
Every mornin', we trappin' and then we kill at night (Then we kill at night)
Got addicted to drugs 'cause I wasn't feelin' right (I wasn't feelin' right)

[Verse 2: Calboy]
Sometimes I just pray that I'ma make it out
Remember back in the day, bitch been tryna break it down
Told my brother, "I love ya", cross me, I'll take ya out
Niggas flexin' with dollars and we gon' take 'em down, uh
Ain't nothin' but killers and drug dealers who I'm rollin' with
Never been robbed except for once, but I won't go again
Said they want smoke, so we gon' slide and we gon' blow again
He talkin' tough, so he gon' die, bet he won't show again
I remember days when we ain't have it (We ain't have it)
Ayy, I had dreams of sippin' lean in the Aston (Sippin' lean in the Aston)
Ayy, foenem brought the Dracos, fully automatic (Fully automatic)
Ayy, step up out the way if foenem get to blastin' (Foenem get to blastin')

[Chorus: Calboy]
Boy, you in these streets, better look left and right (Left and right)
'Cause them niggas out here killin', they'll take your life (Take your life)
He killed him, now he out of mind, out of sight (Hey)
Told the gang better focus, boy, ain't no losin' sight (No losin' sight)
Foenem in the kitchen whippin' Caroline (Caroline)
And I'm still ridin' with them felons, right (Ridin' with them felons, right)
Every mornin', we trappin' and then we kill at night (Then we kill at night)
Got addicted to drugs 'cause I wasn't feelin' right (I wasn't feelin' right)
