Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I met her walking down a uptown street
She's so fine you know I wished she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet

Nobody but you
Yeah, I do mean you
I'm just trying to get a message to you

Nobody but you
Come on and give me a cue
So I can get a message to you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She's sitting right here by my side

Promised someday she will be my bride

Talkin' 'bout you
I do mean you
Nobody but you
Come on, let me get a message through
