[Verse 1]
He'd already asked for my number
When will he call? I wonder
I'd give it away on a Friday
I haven't heard a friggin' now it's Wednesday
I don't know what he's thinking
He can leave me alone and I'll be waitin'
I don't think so
There's other fish in the sea
Who would love to swim with me

[Chorus]
You're not the only one
Out there for me
And I know (and I know)
You're not the only one
Who's gonna be
For me (for me)

[Post-Chorus]
There's other fishes in the sea
There's other fishes in the sea

[Verse 2]
You finally called and I'm not home
Don't even bother at all
Can't remember what he looks like
It's been 14 days, that's not my type
I know they're not all like that
There's gotta be some that don't think they're all that
Yes, I know so
There's other fish in the sea
Who would love to swim with me

[Chorus]
You're not the only one
Out there for me
And I know (and I know)
You're not the only one
Who's gonna be
For me (for me)

[Bridge]
There's other fishes in the sea
There's other fishes in the sea (in the sea)
There's other fishes in the sea
There's other fishes in the sea (fishes in the sea)

[Chorus]
You're not the only one
Out there for me
And I know (and I know)
You're not the only one
Who's gonna be
For me (for me)

[Outro]
You're not the only one
(There's other fishes in the sea)
You're not the only one
(There's other fishes in the sea)
You're not the only one
(There's other fishes in the sea)
You're not the only one
(There's other fishes in the sea)
