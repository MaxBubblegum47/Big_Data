[Verse 1]
Tonight we ride, right or wrong
Tonight we sail, on a radio song
Rescue me, should I go down
If I stay too long in trouble town

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

[Verse 2]
Now and again, I get the feeling
Well, if I don't win, I'm a-gonna break even
Rescue me, should I go wrong
If I dig too deep, if I stay too long

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do

[Verse 3]
I'll be the boy in the corduroy pants
You'll be the girl at the high school dance
Run with me, wherever I go
And just play dumb, whatever you know

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, you wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
But you move me, honey
Yes, you do
You wreck me, baby
Yeah, you break me in two
Oh, but you move me, honey
Ah, yes, you do
