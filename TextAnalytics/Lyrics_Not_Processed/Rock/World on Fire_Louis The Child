[Verse 1]
I keep watching the world trace
Their circles in their places
Joining the race inside a maze
Look 'round, are you one of them?
Yeah, see how they can all seem
Pointless in worry
Slow down to hurry

[Chorus]
The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know
The temperature is rising
And no one knows
Hide behind the money
That's the way it goes
The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know

[Verse 2]
Complaining 'bout the same things
Not watching where we're goin'
Ending up 50
Somehow with nothing
No don't listen to what they say
I admit I know that I have
Don't be the same
Don't be the same

[Chorus]
The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know
The temperature is rising
And no one knows
Hide behind the money
That's the way it goes
The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know

[Bridge]
And so it goes another day here
Passing by
I saw it waving from the window
Could you save me?
Keep takin' time, takin' your time
But there's no time left
Listen for it's almost over
Yeah

[Chorus]
The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know
The temperature is risin'
And no one knows
We'll hide behind the money
That's the way it goes
The world could be on fire
And we wouldn't know
