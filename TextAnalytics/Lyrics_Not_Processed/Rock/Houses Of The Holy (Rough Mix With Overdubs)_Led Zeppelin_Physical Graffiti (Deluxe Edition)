[Chorus]
Let me take you to the movie
Can I take you to the show?
Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

[Verse 1]
From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satan's daughter
And it only goes to show

[Hook]
You know

[Verse 2]
There's an angel on my shoulder
In my hand a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love I'll sow

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So the world is spinning faster
Are you dizzy when you're stoned?
Let the music be your master
Will you heed the master's call?
Oh, Satan

[Verse 4]
Said there ain't no use in crying
Cause it will only, only drive you mad
Does it hurt to hear them lying?
Was this the only world you had? Oh, oh

[Chorus]
So let me take you, take you to the movie
Can I take you, baby, to the show?
Why don't you let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

[Hook]
And you know, thatâ€™s right
