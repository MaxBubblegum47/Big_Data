[Intro]
Let me at them
Say you love me (say you love me)
I know I'm not the only one
Go go Grizz (know I'm not the only one)
Struggles that I'm overcoming
I killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one
W-W-W-W Winners Circle

[Hook]
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one
Struggles I done overcome
I killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one

[Verse 1]
Lay me for a brick layer slangin' weight
Fell in love, made a new mistake
Baby momma arguin', askin' where was I
Instead I ask her "How we do today?"
Breakin' through the safety pin with solid ye
I most likely blew through 28
Women shady, how come I ain't choose to hate?
Loyal to 'em how come I ain't see the play?
Couldn't see no wrong in people tryna help 'em
Wanna see my youngin's really eatin'
Goaltending, blocking blessings for no reason
One bedroom apartment watchin' killer season
Had my share, funny tell you while it's secret
People that you love and they not sharin' nothin'
See you pockets ugly, won't reach out for nothin'
I can't wait to catch you bitches out in public
Buyin' out the mall, fuck your bitch in front you
Okay too aggressive, other women love it
I don't kiss and tell, lot of artists wonder
Cut the bra, and punch it longer in her stomach
Rough and rugged, took some losses, money doubled
Toilet bowl, thinking shittin' on 'em, fuck it
Playin' chess and the bishop on the muscle
You would never love me like my daughter love me

[Hook]
I can't be the one you love
And I can't be the one you love
Struggles I overcome
Killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
Actors got stripes they ain't never earned
Not a freak for fame, rather wait my turn
Say he taddle-tailing put him in the dirt
Fuck his family members, they can wear his shirt
Every rapper talkin' cookin' dope
Flippity flip, break-break your wrist
I desire now to be alone, no attention if it's ignorance
To say it frankly, I don't give a shit
Breathin' hard, come on say what's in your thoughts
Somethin' on your mind, I could take it off
Money mean nothin', I want my respect
Death before dishonor tatted on my flesh
Holes in my clothes, underarms smellin'
Million man march this ain't Malcolm X
Welfare, receivin' government assistance
Get up out the bed, spend up all they check
How you don't know that, you ain't never yeah
What you mean by ye, talkin' sellin' crack
Embalming fluid runs through Montana
Thinking going back and peddle weight
Pills that Reedy stuck stopping up the Brig
Renegade hoes settin' up the trench
Junkies usin' H, it's a better feel

[Hook]
I can't be the one you love
And I can't be the one you love
Struggles I overcome
Killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 3]
Ain't been havin' no dreams
Don't be gettin' no sleep
How can someone call me those things
They don't even know me
I lost everything I love a week ago
Loyalty which probably mean the most
Heart played on every time I gave
Makin' me afraid of being close
Big dog, mouth full of gold
Big loud, ounce getting rolled
We dive out 20 shows
Radio stop playin' songs
I ain't really feel like I was wrong
Southside finest get it on
Right back grindin', teeth grittin'
Ship sinkin', cry about it? No
Catch 'em with the lyrics on a whim
The one who spoke the laws I am him
Started out, we wanted us some ends
Late night discussion of a Benz
Late night we fussin' bout the rent
Eviction notice posted, I ain't notice
Focused tryna get another flip
Wasn't makin' half of what I spent
Tee Newman passenger, we lit
I just got with Mocha that's a lick
Conversation with the boss man, look
We was talkin' signin' him again
Women wanna clown in front they friends
Like you was not respectin' what it is
Listen when I tell you what it is
To be around you signin' a consent
You know I just got married to your friend
I done threw a ring around the dick
Diamonds dancin' every time I spit
Had to throw some bling up on a bitch
Self made stand up guy
God first, hands to the sky
All I do is ride nigga, yeah
I don't even argue about the bread
That lil' money that you owe me, you can have
I can't even see me gettin' mad
I can't even see me goin' backwards
Know you wanna see me on my ass
Cuttin' up with Dreka fine ass
Swagger matchin', where'd you find that?
I just rolled a stick of Mad Hatter
Please me let me enjoy the ride back
Please me let me enjoy the ride back
Could you please me let me enjoy the ride back?
I just rolled a stick with mad air
Cuttin' up with Dreka fine ass
Swagger matchin', where'd you find that?

[Outro]
See I live my life like you know I'm gonna enjoy this bitch 'cause you never know when this gon' be over. I can't be the one you love
