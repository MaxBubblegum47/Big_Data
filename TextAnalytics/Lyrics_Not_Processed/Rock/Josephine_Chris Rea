There's rain on my window
And I'm thinking of you
Tears on my pillow
But I will come through
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
And every single step I take
I take for you
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
Now there's a storm on my radar
But I can still fly
And you are the reason
The blue in my sky
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
Josephine
A life without meaning
I was walking away
In the coldest of winters
Night becomes day
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
And every single step I take
I take for you
My Josephine
I'll send you all my love
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
Send you all my love
Josephine
I'll send you all my love
When I'm far away
I'll send you all my love
Josephine
