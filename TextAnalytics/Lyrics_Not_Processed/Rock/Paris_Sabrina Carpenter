[Verse 1]
If I asked that boy to jump, I know he would
He don't even have to say, it's understood
He treat me nice, he treat me right, he treat me good
Still I get so hesitant, still I get so hesitant
So I took myself where I think I should be
Something told me that it's waiting here for me
Parisian nights, Parisian high, Parisian breeze
Feeding me like medicine, feeding me like medicine, yeah

[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A
Yeah, I already have love in L.A

[Verse 2]
If you show me too much love, it makes me leave
Guess that's one of many things that’s wrong with me
Looking past you when you're right in front of me
I won't do that anymore, I won't do that anymore
Why'd it take so long for me to know this?
Scared to put the water with the roses
Halfway 'cross the world for me to notice
But I notice, yeah, I notice, yeah

[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A

[Bridge]
Je ne voulais pas trouver l'amour
Mais Paris a quelque chose
Qui donne envie d'aimer, d'aimer passionément
Mon coeur est à toi pour toujours
You will always have my heart

[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
(Already have love)
It's so romantic in Paris 
(So romantic in Paris)
Won't even try to compare it 
(I know that I try)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A
It’s so romantic in Paris, babe
Won’t even try to compare it 
(Won't even try, won't even try)
Thought I was sure that I’d find it 
(I was sure, I was sure)
But I already have love in L.A
But I already have love in L.A
