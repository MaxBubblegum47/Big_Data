[Intro]
Ok, Louis

[Verse 1]
Take his ass straight to OKC
Chris Paul, I've been running with the thing lately
Now you lonely, take your niggas Kony
Cheese all in my pockets like it's macaroni
Ah uh uh uh uh, sideline seats
Where you get my email nigga, I don't want your beats
How you getting money nigga, you can't even eat
Chasing all my dreams nigga, you thought I was Meek
Slide with my socks, Pass me the rock
I ain't talking Johnson, but I put him in a lock
I've been on my Jadakiss don't let me get the hawk
I've been in my zone, call up Rudy get the Chalk
Got to hurry up because the cops are gaining on me
Heard he got a beef, I pull up on him like bologna
Started acting up before I pulled up on your homie
Hito Hito fruit, call me Chopper like I'm Tony
Wait, wait nigga what?
Tell me, why you gotta front?

[Verse 2]
Sucks! now you outta luck
I been going up, juice all in my cup
Sippy, sippy, sippy, nigga I been turning up
Fifty, fifty, fifty, nigga give me all your lunch
Loud pack hit his chest, just like a punch
She been in my crib, you know that was lunch
Uh uh, I don't mean to flex
Shawty say I'm next, gold all on my neck
She sent me a text, she was sounding vexed
That girl is annoying, all I want is neck
Pull up in a foreign, looking like a Czech
Pull up and it's roaring, like a T-Rex
Shawty said I'm boring, I got on my specs
Even when it's pouring, I'm still looking fresh

[Chorus]
Pull up on the scene
I ain't gettin' hoes, nigga what the hell that mean?
Pull up on a nigga, you could swear I was a fiend
I'm in love with money nigga, I just love the green
Uh uh uh lean, Imma do my thing
God upon my side, I don't fear a thing
Search a nigga up, like his name on Bing
I just got some drip, and it was a ring
