Nothing I can do
Maybe I won't even try
Oh, your will is determined to kill any reason of mine
I see you coming
With that look in your eye
You act like a king but you ain't got a thing in your mind
Now there's nobody home
My belly is aching
Your image is blown
Your lights are burning bright
But nobody's home
You talk about love and affection
Oh, if only you could
You're full of pride, but there's nothing inside and you think you're so good
You know you got it coming to ya
All things return
You need me, it's not gonna be my concern
Now there's nobody home
Your message is changing
The children have grown
Your lights are burning bright
But nobody's home
I said that nobody's home
My belly is aching
Your image is blown
Your lights are burning bright
But nobody's home
I hear you crying
Mmh, what can I say?
You get what you give, so forgive me as I turn away
Now there's nobody home
My belly is aching
Your image is blown
Your lights are burning bright
But nobody's home
I said that nobody's home
A legend is dying
The seeds have been sown
Your lights are burning bright
But nobody's home
