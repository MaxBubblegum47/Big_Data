[Verse 1]
Tell me what's on your mind
'Cause I'm not going nowhere tonight
Take as long as you need
Let me be your therapy

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever has thrown you down
You can turn it around right here

[Chorus]
'Cause there won't be no other way
When you can't find the words to say
Let your head go, just let go
Of what you're holding on, holding on
Come lay down next to me
You're only gonna find yourself some peace
If you let go, really let go
Of what you're holding on, holding on oh

[Verse 2]
And I know you like to keep these feelings at bay
But you don't need to be afraid
'Cause nothing that you do could ever change
The way that I feel, the way that feel about you

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever has thrown you down
You can turn it around right here

[Chorus]
'Cause it won't be no other way
When you can't find the words to say
Let your head go, just let go
Of what you're holding on, holding on
Come lay down next to me
You're only gonna find yourself some peace
If you let go, really let go
Of what you’re holding on, holding on oh

[Bridge]
And I don't mind
When you get like this sometimes
'Cause I know that you're more
Than what you're making yourself out to be

[Chorus]
Cause it won't be no other way
When you can't find the words to say
Let your head go, just let go
Of what you're holding on, holding on
Come lay down next to me
You're only gonna find yourself some peace
If you let go, really let go
Of what you’re holding on, holding on (Hey)
'Cause it won't be no other way
When you can't find the words to say
Let your head go, just let go
Of what you're holding on, holding on
Come lay down next to me
You're only gonna find yourself some peace
If you let go, really let go
Of what you're holding on, holding on
