"One, two
One, two, three, four"

[Intro]
Ooh, we're getting ready
Ready, go!
Ha ha ha
Get ready

[Verse 1]
Ooh, we're gettin' ready to rock
We're gettin' ready to roll
I'm gonna turn up the heat
I'm gonna fire up the coal

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta keep that motor turning
I gotta keep that engine clean
I gotta keep those tires burning
I've got the best you've ever seen

[Chorus]
And I'm a heatseeker charging up the sky
And I'm a heatseeker
And I, I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
To hose me down

[Verse 2]
We're gettin' ready to break
Gettin' ready to go
Get your shoes off and shake
Get your head down and blow

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta keep that woman firing
You gotta keep that circuit clean
You gotta make her sound the siren
You gotta hear that lady scream

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a heatseeker, burning up the town
And I'm a heatseeker, and I don't
I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Don't hose me down
Aw, here it come

[Solo]
Ready?
Heatseeker

[Verse 3]
I want to see you get up
And see the whites of your eyes

[Chorus]
And I'm a heatseeker
(Heatseeker)

[Verse 4]
Yeah
I'm gonna measure you up
I'm gonna try you for size

[Chorus]
And I'm a heatseeker

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta keep that motor turning
Ya gotta keep that engine clean
Ya gotta keep those tires burning
I've got the best you've ever seen

[Outro]
And I'm a heatseeker
And I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Woah, I'm a heatseeker
And I'm a heatseeker
Heatseeker
Out on the street, feel the heat
Ow!
