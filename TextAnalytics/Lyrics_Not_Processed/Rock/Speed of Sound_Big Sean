[Intro]
Block Beaters
Make my dream real
Bl-bl-bl-bl-block Beaters

Moving at the speed of sound
With my head up in the clouds
Moving at the speed of sound
With my head up in the clouds
Yeah yeah, my life's like

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Moving at the speed of sound
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
With my head up in the clouds
Yeah yeah, my life's like
Moving at the speed of sound
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
With my head up in the clouds

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
My ma keeps telling me
I better stay in school
But when that ends, Lord knows
I don't know what I'm going to do

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Cause everytime I blink now
Another day rolls by
It's getting harder not to think about
All the things on my mind
Like, I remember this time last year
I was all alone
I felt like I was two feet tall
Now there's a hundred million numbers
Inside of my phone
But I still got no one to call
My life's like

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
My friends keep telling me
How much they believe in me
I wish that I saw the things that they see in me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My life's like
My life's like
Ay, do it, ay, music, ay
High rise, elevator life
I'm gone in 60 seconds
On Talladega nights
I know I'm living wrong
I wish I could make it right
But baby, hold that thought...
Cause I gotta take this flight
Where'd I leave my passport
Overseas passports
Hotels with the glass floors
Everything I ask for
Fast cars, fast hoes
My whole life is fast foward
But if I stop, stop
I might hit that dashboard
And I be, I be
I be, I be always takin trips
In and out relations with
Girls who want relationships
And I can fake a smile
And a conversation when
We just can't see eye to eye
We might need that LASIK shit
Cause tomorrow I'll be (gone gone gone)
Dip into another time (zone zone zone)
Tryna make my hotel feel like (home home home)
Phone won't stop ringing but I still feel all alone
My life's like

[Hook]

Bring it up, bring it up, move it up, up up...)
