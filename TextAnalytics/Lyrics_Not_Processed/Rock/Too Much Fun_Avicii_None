[Verse 1]
You've been gone for way too long
Mama said gone for way too long
It’s about time to come back home
Papa said time to come back home
Come back home, come back home, come back home

[Chorus]
I think I'll stay for a while
Just a while
Too much fun
Yeah, I think I'll stay for a while
I got time
Said and done

[Chorus]
I think I’ll stay for a while
Just a while
Too much fun
Yeah, I think I'll stay for a while
I got time
Said and done

[Chorus]
I think I'll stay for a while
Just a while
Too much fun
Yeah, I think I'll stay for a while
I got time
Said and done

[Outro]
Too much fun, too much fun
