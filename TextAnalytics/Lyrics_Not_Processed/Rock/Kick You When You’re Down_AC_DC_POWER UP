[Intro]
As you're slipping down the wall
And you're headed for a fall
As you're slipping down the wall
Why do they kick you when you're down?
Why do they kick you when you're down?

[Verse 1]
Hey, mama
Why are you beatin' on my head?
Hey, hey, woman
Why do you kick me outta bed?
I said

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it something, is it something that I said?

[Chorus]
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
As you're slippin' down the wall
And you're headed for a fall
Why do they kick you when you're down?
Why do they kick you when you're down?

[Verse 2]
Shady lady
You think that money grows on trees
Rotten apples by the barrel ain't a delicacy
You see

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this is the way, the way it's meant to be?

[Chorus]
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
As you're slippin' down the wall
And you're headed for a fall
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
So down

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't need to say
To say it ain't a sacrifice

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this is the way, the way it's meant to be?

[Chorus]
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
As you're slippin' down the wall
And you're headed for a fall
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you when you're down?
(Oh no)
Why do they kick you?
Man, they're trying to trick you when you're down
