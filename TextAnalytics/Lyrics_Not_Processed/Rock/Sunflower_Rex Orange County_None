[Intro]
Oh, I want to know
Where I can go
When you're not around
And I'm feeling down
So won't you stay for a moment
So I can say
I, I need you so
'Cause right now you know
That nothing here's new
And I'm obsessed with you
Then I fell to the ground
And you smiled at me and said

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna see you cry
You don't have to feel this emptiness
She said I love you til' the day that I die
Well, maybe she's right
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me
And to be honest I don't even know why
I let myself get down in the first place

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes

[Verse 2]
You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream
A dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
I'm lucky to be me and you can see it in my face
Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place?

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down, down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes

[Bridge]
And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
Said I didn't need to get down or feel empty inside
And told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive
And well, maybe she's right
'Cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
See, I honestly don't even know why
I-I honestly don't even know why

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
