[Verse 1: Forrest]
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the bright is
Two left feet, can you show me where the right is?
I been on the low side
I been on the high side
Think I need to get out, find me in the high tide
Get out of the wifi
Get out of the timeline
I don't need the limelight, just a line of my time
Take me to that real life
Take me for a lifetime
I've been in the dark for way too long, will you

[Chorus: Forrest]
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is

[Verse 2: Forrest]
Gimme that earth, wind, and breeze
Rolling down the window, 82 degrees
All my problems chasing me
Where I'm going, they can't be
And if they come, I will go
To somewhere that's never cold
Might just stay, til' I'm gray
Let my worries wash away, will you

[Chorus: Forrest]
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
