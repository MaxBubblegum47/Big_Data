This is the introduction to Ringo's "Don't Pass Me By"
Take 4

[Orchestra]

[Verse 1: Ringo]
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Verse 2: Ringo]
I hear the clock a'ticking
On the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Chorus: Ringo]
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 3: Ringo]
I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

[Chorus: Ringo]
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 1: Ringo]
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Chorus: Ringo]
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Outro: Ringo]
I'm waiting for you, honey
Hurry up to me
I don't want you to pass me by
I don't want you to make me cry
I want you to make me happy
Happy, happy
'Cause that's what I want
This is so friendly
This is so friendly
This is so friendly
