[Verse]
Watchin' movies on my phone whenever I want
I turn it as loud as it goes, 'cause when nobody's home
I'm the King of Everything, make the rules up on my own
I can break 'em if I please 'cause I make up the police
And everybody's equal, but not me 'cause I'm the king
I make all the other people tell me secrets in my dreams

[Chorus]
I wake up when they tell us to
If not, I'll sleep with you
I'll take my time to make you smile
'Cause I know just how you feel when you're alone

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
And you don't need me, no
I'll take all your time
And I love the way it feels when you take the wheel
I know, you don't

[Outro]
I'll take all your time
I'll take all your time
