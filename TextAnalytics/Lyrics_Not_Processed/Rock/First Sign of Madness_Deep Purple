[Verse 1]
Somebody tell me
Why I'm talking to myself
I never listen to a word I say
Nor does anyone else
Somebody ask me
If I have any doubt
Maybe yes, maybe no
It's something to think about

[Verse 2]
The first sign of madness
Is talking to yourself
When I'm deep in conversation
Boy it sure is hard to tell
You're going to have to put me down
You don't know where I've been
You can't imagine in your wildest dreams
The kind of shit we're in

[Outro][x2]
Rambling on again
No-one's listening
On and on again
Don't believe a single word
