[Verse 1]
You know sometimes, I don't know why
But this old town just seems so hopeless
I ain't really sure, but it seems I remember the good times
Were just a little bit more in focus
But when she puts her arms around me
I can somehow rise above it
Yeah, man, when I got that little girl standin' right by my side
You know, I can tell the whole wide world to shove it, hey!

[Chorus]
Here comes my girl
Here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right
She is all I need tonight

[Verse 2]
Every now and then I get down to the end of the day
I have to stop and ask myself why I've done it
It just seems so useless to have to work so hard
And nothin' ever really seems to come from it
And then she looks me in the eye and says, "We're gonna last forever"
And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it
No, 'cause it just feels so good, and so free, and so right
I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it, hey!

[Chorus]
Here comes my girl
Here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right
She is all I need tonight

[Bridge]
Watch her walk

[Verse 3]
Every time it seems like there ain't nothin' left no more
I find myself having to reach out and grab hold of something
Yeah, I just catch myself wondering, waiting, and worrying
About some silly little things that don't add up to nothin'
And then she looks me in the eye and says, "We're gonna last forever"
And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it
No, 'cause it just feels so good, and so free, and so right
I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it, hey!

[Chorus]
Here comes my girl
Here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right
She is all I need tonight

[Outro]
That's right
That's right
Oh!
