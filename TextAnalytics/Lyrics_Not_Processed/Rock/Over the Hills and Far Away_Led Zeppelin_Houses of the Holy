[Verse 1]
Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling; walk a while with me
Oh, you've got so much, so much, so much

[Verse 2]
Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road
Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Really ought to know (oh, oh, oh)
I really ought to know
Oh, you know I should, you know I should
You know I should've known
