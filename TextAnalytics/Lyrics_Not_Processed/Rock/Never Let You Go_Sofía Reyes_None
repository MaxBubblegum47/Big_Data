[Verse 1]
Calling on me to lift you up
Whenever you're feeling down
Some kind of freak
Nobody understands
What you’re going through

[Chorus]
It's a hard time finding your freedom
And a long way to go
But I say, "It's within your heart and buried in your soul"
As long as I’m with you, I'll never let you go
"It's within your heart and buried in your soul"
As long as I'm with you, I'll never let you go

[Post-Chorus]
"It's within your heart and buried in your soul"
As long as I'm with you, I'll never let you go
"It’s within your heart and buried in your soul"
As long as I’m with you

[Verse 2]
Te voy a buscar, sólo tú me puedes salvar
When I'm falling down, down, down
(When I’m falling down, down, down)
Loca voy a quedar, sólo tú puedes curar
What I'm going through now

[Chorus]
It's a hard time finding your freedom
And a long way to go
But I say, "It's within your heart and buried in your soul"
As long as I’m with you, I'll never let you go
"It's within your heart and buried in your soul"
As long as I'm with you, I'll never let you go

[Outro]
I'll never let you go, oh, oh, oh
I'll never let you go
No, no
No te vayas
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no te vayas, amor
No, I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no te vayas, amor
