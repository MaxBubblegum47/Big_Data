[Intro: Big Sean]
Oh god!
Sean Don
Fall Out... Boi

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]
Di-di-did you trip down 12 steps into Malibu, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Malibu, ooh, ooh, ooh,)
So why the hell is there a light that's keeping us forever
Bel Air baby, did you get dressed up, pretty pout, pout
(While you bottomed out, out, out, out, oh)
I can't stop it when there's chemicals keeping us together
Uh, uh, uh, I'm singing

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Whoa, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
They fall in love, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
Oh, how the mighty fall in love

[Verse 2: Patrick Stump]
Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme
 and I'm dizzy on dreams
(And I'm dizzy on dreams)
But if you ask me two's a whole lot lonelier than one
Baby, we should have left our love in the gutter where we found it
(Gutter where we found it)
Cause you think, you think your only crime is that you got caught
I'm singing

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Whoa, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
They fall in love, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
Oh, how the mighty fall in love

[Bridge: Patrick Stump]
It's getting clear, you're never coming clean
So lock you up inside and swallow, swallow the key

[Verse 3: Big Sean & 
Patrick Stump
]
Hello? Yeah, I know you said not to call unless I'm dying
Well, I'm driving and I can't stop staring at my eyelids
But, even though my eyes closed, I still see you
I just hope that when you see me, I'm not see-through, you know how we do (
Oh
)
Sometimes I swear, I need a day just for me to lay
With some T and A, but the way we, the way we do is (
Oh
)
Deeper, baby, straight-up chemistry, DNA
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A (
Oh
)
Like, I let her climb on top
I'm either fuckin' or workin', so the grind don't stop (
Oh
)
They say I got screws missing, well hell, only when I'm missing you
And hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, addicted to you

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Whoa, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
They fall in love, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
Oh, how the mighty fall in love
