I see the feathers in your hair
They're calling at me
Don't go nowhere
I'm looking at you from across the room
You with your shades on
This southern moon
You hold a secret in your hand
Your eyes are burning
Can't understand
But now I feel us start to
Lose control
A spiral motion
Don't let me go
So make your mind up baby
You're blinded by the sights
Those flashing lights have got you caught up tonight
So make your mind up baby
It's painted black and white
Lets keep it moving or lets turn out the lights
So make your mind up
Oh honey can't you understand
Your lucky number
Come take my hand
Woke up this morning you were next to me
Under the covers I couldn't see
And I can't read between your lines
I'm staring at you and losing sight
But now the city's sweeping you away
A destination
Mid-summer stay
So make your mind up baby
You're blinded by the sights
Those flashing lights have got you caught up tonight
So make your mind up baby
It's painted black and white
Lets keep it moving or lets turn out the lights
Oh you gotta
Oh you gotta make your mind up
Baby cause I've made up mine
Oh you gotta
Oh you gotta make your mind up
Baby cause I've made up mine
Oh you gotta
Oh you gotta make your mind up
Baby cause I've made up mine
Oh you gotta
Oh you gotta make your mind up
Baby cause I've made up mine
Oh you gotta
Oh you gotta make your mind up
Baby cause I've made up mine
Oh you gotta
Oh you gotta make your mind up
Baby cause I've made up mine yeah
