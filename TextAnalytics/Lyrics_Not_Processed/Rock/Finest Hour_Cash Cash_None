[Verse 1]
Walking in with good intentions
Walking out with no patience
I feel my buttons being pressed on
I feel my body tryna start some
I know I'm young but I'm pissed off
Telling everyone to kick rocks
A couple rounds of the Mezcal

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm falling down and I'm holding it all by a thread now
No, I ain't perfect, never said I was perfect
And I'm putting it all on a prayer now
No, I ain't perfect, never said I was perfect

[Chorus]
This ain't my finest hour
Might see my flaws today
My words are out of order
Maybe my drink's to blame
Emptying all my pockets
'Til I don't feel a thing
This ain't my finest hour
This ain't my finest hour

[Post-Chorus]
This ain't my f--

[Verse 2]
Bottling my emotions
All this talk and commotion
Everybody got me stressed out
I can't control if I break down
Every night is a big blur
I can't get a hold of my temper
Ain't no one to depend on

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm falling down and I'm holding it all by a thread now
No, I ain't perfect, never said I was perfect
And I'm putting it all on a prayer now
No, I ain't perfect, never said I was perfect

[Chorus]
This ain't my finest hour
Might see my flaws today
My words are out of order
Maybe my drink's to blame
Emptying all my pockets
'Til I don't feel a thing
This ain't my finest hour
This ain't my finest hour

[Post-Chorus]
This ain't my f--

[Bridge]
I can't hide my flaws (I)
And it's all my fault (No, I ain't perfect)
I am on my knees (Never said I was perfect)
Don't give up on me
I can't hide my flaws
And it's all my fault ('Cause I deserve it)
I am on my knees
Don't give up on me

[Chorus]
This ain't my finest hour
Might see my flaws today
My words are out of order
Maybe my drink's to blame
Emptying all my pockets
'Til I don't feel a thing
This ain't my finest hour
This ain't my finest hour

This ain't my finest hour
