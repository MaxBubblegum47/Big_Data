[Intro]
Hello?
Hello, hello?
What?
Can you see? Okay (
Yeah
)
It's okay. Just a.. just a little lower, just so I can see
It's all those changes, amazing changes
Take two
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 1]
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents, he always took his mom
He's the all American, bullet-headed, saxon mother's son

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
Was it a thrill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 2]
Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 3]
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce," his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him"

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
Was it a thrill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

[Outro]
Hey!
Bungalow, bungalow, bungalow Bill
Can you pass that ash tray? 
Take three
What'd you think?
I think you can do better
Yeah. Are you.. is Yoko picking up on that bit?
