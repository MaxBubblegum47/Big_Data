[Verse 1: Danielle Haim]
You know I'm bad at communication
It's the hardest thing for me to do
And it's said it's the most important part
That relationships go through
And I gave it all away, just so I could say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

[Verse 2: Danielle Haim]
You know there's no rhyme or reason
For the way you turned out to be
I didn't go and try to change my mind
Not intentionally
I know it's hard to hear me say it
But I can't bear to stay in
I just know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Danielle Haim]
Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire
Oh, but I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

[Chorus: Danielle Haim]
It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

[Verse 3: Alana Haim]
No need to use your imagination
Try and make it what you want it to be
Because I'm sorry I did what I did, but
It came naturally
And I gave it all away just so I could say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway

[Verse 4: Este Haim]
When I tried to keep myself together
After all the opportunities
I tried to stay true to you
And I tried to do what you wanted from me
And I gave it all away just to hear you say that
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're gonna be okay anyway (Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus: Danielle Haim]
Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire
Oh, but I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

[Chorus: Danielle Haim]
It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

[Bridge: Danielle Haim]
Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire
Always keep your heart locked tight
Don't let your mind retire, oh
But I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
Ooh, yeah
But I just couldn't take it
I tried hard not to fake it
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire

[Chorus: Danielle Haim]
It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
It felt right (Hey!)
It felt right, oh
Oh, but I fumbled it when it
Came down to the wire, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hey!)
It felt right, oh
But I fumbled it when it came down to the wire
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Danielle Haim]
Oh, no, no, no, no
It felt right (It felt right)
Oh, it felt right (It felt right)
It felt right
Oh, no, no, no, no
But I fumbled it when it
Came down to the wire
Yeah
