[Instrumental intro 0:00-4:21]

[Verse 1]
You're lazy, you just stay in bed
You're lazy just stay in bed
You don't want no money, you don't want no bread
If you're drowning, you don't clutch no straw
If you're drowning, you don't clutch no straw
You don't want to live, don't want to cry no more

[Harmonica Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Well, my crying ain't done no good
I said, my trying ain't done no good
You don't make no effort, no, not like you should

[Chorus]
Lazy!
You just stay in bed
Lazy!
You just stay in bed
You don't want no money, you don't want no bread

[Instrumental outro 5:53-7:22]
