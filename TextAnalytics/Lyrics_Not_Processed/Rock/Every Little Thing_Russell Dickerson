[Intro]
Who!
Huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
My baby, she's Alabama
A dixie land delight, kissin' me like molasses
Slow and sweet, mhm, just right
She's an endless August summer, yeah, sunshine 3-6-5
When she forgets the punch line, it still gets me every time

[Chorus]
'Cause I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
I'm all hung up, 'cause I love
Every little, every little, every little thing about her love

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she's Seattle and Sonoma
Runs on coffee and red wine
She's easy like Sunday morning and wild like Saturday night
She's 24-carat goodness, an angel's all I see
She dresses up for everything, but she only dress down for me

[Chorus]
And I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
I'm all hung up, 'cause I love
Every little, every little, every little thing about her love

[Bridge]
Yeah! Who! Come on!
Woah, hey!
My baby, she's Alabama
My Dixie Land delight
She's everybody's dream girl, but she's all mine

[Chorus]
And I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
I'm all hung up, 'cause I love
Every little, every little, every little thing about her love

[Outro]
About her love
Hey, hey, yeah
Who, hey, hey!
About her love
