[Verse 1]
You're the last thing that I cling to
Before I fall asleep at night
You're the first thing that reach for
In the early morning light

[Chorus]
You're the name that I see written in the stars
You're the face that I see in every cloud
Oh, I wish you could have been more like
Your memory and kept hanging around

[Verse 2]
You're that tap on my shoulder
You're that voice in the crowd
You're that constant distraction
You're that book I can't put down

[Chorus]
You're the name that I see written in the stars
You're the face that I see in every cloud
Oh, I wish you could have been more like
Your memory and kept hanging around

[Verse 3]
It keeps haunting me, I still want and need you, always will
You're every, thought I think, every sight I see
Every feeling I feel

[Chorus]
You're the name that I see written in the stars
You're the face that I see in every cloud
Oh, I wish you could have been more like
Your memory and kept hanging around

[Outro]
You're the last thing that I wish for
When I lay down at night
