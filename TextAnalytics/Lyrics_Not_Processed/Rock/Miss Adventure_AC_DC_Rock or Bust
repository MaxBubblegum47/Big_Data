[Verse 1]
Well, we're back and I'm on the loose
Ya hear me aim and feel the juice
She eye you up, she eye you down
Ow, she make you, make you stand up proud

[Chorus]
Miss adventure (hot surprise)
Bare essential (yeah, that's nice)
Miss adventure (feel her reel)
Confidential (lips are sealed, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Want some pie, but cat got your tongue
Feelin' like some hot cross buns
Love you, love you all the night
Make you, make you nice and tight

[Chorus]
Miss adventure (hot surprise)
Bare essential (yeah, that's nice)
Miss adventure (feel her reel)
Confidential (now, your lips are sealed, yeah)

[Bridge]
Miss adventure
Miss adventure
(Yeah, that's nice)

(Feel her reel)
(Keep it goin')
(You can't think twice)

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Miss adventure
Bare essential
Miss adventure
Confidential

Miss adventure
Miss adventure
Miss adventure
Feel her reel
