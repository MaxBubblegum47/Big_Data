[Verse 1]
Mama, take this badge off of me
I can’t use it anymore
It’s getting dark, too dark to see
I feel I’m knockin' on heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

[Verse 2]
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can’t shoot them anymore
That long, black cloud is comin' down
I feel like I’m knockin' on heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door, yeah, yeah
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
