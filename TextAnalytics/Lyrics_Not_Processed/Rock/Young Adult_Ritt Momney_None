[Verse 1]
Jumped down the well
Found just your shell
You’ll find yourself
I’ll fix myself

[Verse 2]
But if your sentences are short
Oh, you’ll have to clear your throat
Let the devil through the door
Call yourself a young adult
Seems like all the ones you lost
Were the ones you asked to stay
Best to pick apart your thoughts
Before they do to you the same

[Bridge]
Walk past the truth
Don’t look for clues
Trust only blue
Trust only blue

[Verse 3]
Though it’s not pleasant to feel
It’s the only thing that’s real
Any comfort you can get
Is one that you won’t regret
As the sunlight turns to dust
I’ll try to resist the rust
The only knife that doesn’t hurt
Is the knife that you don’t touch

[Chorus]
You will never have to be true ‘till the roses rot
And if you’re tripping up, you’ll see soon the ground’s kinda soft
And there is always something to do ‘till you blow it off

[Pre-Chorus]
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few 
(Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few 
(Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few 
(Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few 
(Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)

[Chorus]
You will never have to be true ‘till the roses rot
And if you’re tripping up, you’ll see soon the ground’s kinda soft
And there is always something to do ‘till you blow it off
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
You will never have to be true ‘till the roses rot
And if you’re tripping up, you’ll see soon the ground’s kinda soft
And there is always something to do ‘till you blow it off
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few
