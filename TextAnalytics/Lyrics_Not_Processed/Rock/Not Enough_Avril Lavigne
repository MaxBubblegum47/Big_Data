[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if this hurts you
But I tried to keep what we had once, I was wrong
It wasn't keeping me awake
You didn't listen (You didn't listen)
You didn't hear me (You didn't hear me)
When I said "I want more," I got no more
You weren't stealing me away, oh

[Chorus]
It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh

[Verse 2]
All the memories that we're losing
All the time that I spent with you every day
I think is running down the drain
I'm feeling (Feeling) that we're fading
Don't make this as hard as you'd think it would be
It's a lot easier than it seems, yeah

[Chorus]
It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up

[Bridge]
And I can feel we're falling down slowly, slowly
I can see us starting to drown, can't stop it now
I can see we're burning out, so show me, show me
How you're gonna turn it around, because

[Chorus]
It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need
It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up

[Post-Chorus]
It's not enough, it's not enough (To give me)
It's not enough, it's not enough  (What it is I want)
It's not enough, it's not enough (To get me)
For me (Everything I need)
It's not enough, it's not enough (To give me)
It's not enough, it's not enough  (What it is I want)
It's not enough, it's not enough (To get me)
For me

[Outro]
Hey
Oh, mmm
Mmm
Oh, hmm
