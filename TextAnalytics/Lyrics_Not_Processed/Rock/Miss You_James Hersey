[Verse:]
Show me
What it means to be yours
What it means to be more, more
What it means to be more
A-ah

[Verse:]
Show me
What a difference you make
What a word that you say now could mean when it's over
And it comes time for change

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
A-ah
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(A-ah)
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse:]
Show me
How to get what you give
How to let go and live, live
How to let go and live
A-ah

[Verse:]
Show me (show me)
What a life this could be
What a promise you make now could mean when the day comes, that everything you see
Is without me

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
A-ah
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(A-ah)

[Outro:]
'Cause I'm gonna miss you...
I'm gonna miss you... a-ah (ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna miss you...
I'm gonna miss you... a-ah (ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna miss you... (ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna miss you...
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
