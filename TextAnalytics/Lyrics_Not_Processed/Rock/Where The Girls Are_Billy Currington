[Verse 1]
Well here we again me and my friends on a Friday night
Waiting on Jimmy he's always got to get his hair just right
Bobby yells where we going to go
Ah you'd think by now he'd know

[Chorus]
Where the girls are where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart where the girls are

[Verse 2]
Pile three in my truck the rest will follow us and we'll head downtown
Ah we all know the drill hit Jack and Jill's then the Cavalier Lounge
Jimmy you run in and look around
And we'll know if you don't come out

[Chorus]
Where the girls are where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart where the girls are

[Bridge]
If we got to cross the county line
Oh you can bet we're going to find

[Chorus]
Where the girls are where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart where the girls are
Where the girls are where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart where the girls are
