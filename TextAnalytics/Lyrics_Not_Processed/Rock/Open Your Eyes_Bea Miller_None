[Verse 1]

Water and light
This is us
History falling down, hope rising up
We're there here and now
All that came before cannot stay asleep
We're not children anymore
Oh

[Chorus]

We can fight the dark
This is who we are
There's a new light coming
Finally had enough
Finally waking up
To who we are becoming
Open your eyes!
Open your eyes!

[Verse 2]

Will you be my love?
Will you go with me?
Are you who I dreamed or just a memory?
Will you understand what I have to do?
Will you be the man, the one I thought I knew?
Oh

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Into the deep blue
We'll do it together
Water and fire reach higher
There's no turning back, oh
Open your eyes!

[Chorus]
