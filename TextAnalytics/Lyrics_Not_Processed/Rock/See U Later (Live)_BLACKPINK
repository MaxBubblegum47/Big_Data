[블랙핑크 "SEE U LATER (Live)" 가사]

[Verse 1: Jisoo & 
Lisa
]
아쉬울 것도 없어
진짜 할 만큼 했어
난 어차피 너 따위 있으나 없으나 똑같아
매번 약속은 번복
또 셀 수 없이 반복
너란 남자 딱 그 정도 내 마음 다 줬지만 no

[Refrain: Jennie & 
Rosé
]
빈 깡통 같은 네 sorry
이젠 그저 개 짖는 소리
정신을 차리고 보니 네 모든 게 오글거려
널 버려줄 게 recycle
네 옆에 그녀는 바보
오늘 난 말할 게 I don't want you no more

[Pre-Chorus: Jennie & 
Lisa
]
Hold up 영원할 거라 했어?
근데 결론은 또 you messed up
왔다 갔다 가벼운 넌 ping-pong
난 지금 너를 차는 거야, ding-dong
Player, you ain't know
사람 잘못 골랐어
나만을 바라보고 위해 받들어 줬어야 해
여왕벌처럼
 (Woo!)

[Chorus: Jennie & 
Lisa
]
See you later, boy, see you later
See you later, boy, see you later, later
See you later, boy, see you later
Would've, could've, should've, didn't
See you later, boy, see you later
See you later, boy, see you later, later
See you later, boy, see you later
See you later, maybe never

[Verse 2: Jisoo & 
Lisa
]
콩깍지 벗겨졌어
잡아도 소용없어
또 이랬다저랬다 이러쿵저러쿵 구차해
이제는 you ain't got no best friend (Ew)
외로울 거야 weekend (He-he!)
그래 넌 loser 외톨이 못된 양아치, ha-ah-ah

[Refrain: Jennie & 
Rosé
]
빈 깡통 같은 네 sorry
이젠 그저 개 짖는 소리
정신을 차리고 보니 네 모든 게 못나 보여
널 버려줄 게 recycle
네 옆에 그녀는 바보
오늘 난 말할 게 I don't want you no more

[Pre-Chorus: Jennie & 
Lisa
; 
both
]
아픔도 모르게 빨랐던 시간만큼 
(Hey)
너는 훅 간 거야 지금 방금 
(Hey)
내가 누군지 
까먹었니
 똑바로 기억해
I'm a boss bitch
너 정도는 바로 정돈
이미 지웠어 네 전화번호
설렘을 향해 다시 심장의 시동을 걸고 boomin'
Pedal to the metal like

[Chorus: Jennie & 
Lisa
]
See you later, boy, see you later
See you later, boy, see you later, later
See you later, boy, see you later
Would've, could've, should've, didn't
See you later, boy, see you later
See you later, boy, see you later, later
See you later, boy, see you later
See you later, maybe never

[Bridge: Jisoo & 
Rosé
]
Goodbye, baby 내가 네 곁에 있었을 때 잘하지 왜
Why you wanna go and do that, do that, why?
내 뒷모습을 좋아하던 너
지금 실컷 보고 잘 기억해
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye

[Chorus: Jennie & 
Lisa
]
See you later, boy, see you later
See you later, boy, see you later, later
See you later, boy, see you later
Would've, could've, should've, didn't
See you later, boy, see you later 
(Hey!)
See you later, boy, see you later, later 
(Woo!)
See you later, boy, see you later
See you later, maybe never

[Bridge: Lisa]
(Would've, would've, would've)
Would've, could've, should've, didn't
(Would've, would've, would've)
Would've, could've, should've, didn't
(Would've, would've, would've)
Would've, could've, should've, didn't

[Chorus: Jennie & 
Lisa
]
See you later, boy, see you later
See you later, boy, see you later
Would've, could've, should've, didn't
See you later, boy, see you later
See you later, boy, see you later, later
See you later, boy, see you later
See you later, maybe never
