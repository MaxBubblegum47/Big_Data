[Verse 1: Kevin Ford]
When I close my eyes, I feel your skin
Back into my mind and back again
Crawling down my spine, your fingertips
I hate that I do, I'm getting visions of you

[Chorus: Kevin Ford]
Alone in my bed, I can smell the perfume
Get out of my head, these visions of you
It's all that I see, tell me the truth
Are you thinking of me? I'm getting visions of you
I'm getting visions of you
I'm getting visions of you
I'm getting visions of you
I'm getting visions of you
Alone in my bed, I can smell the perfume
Get out of my head, these visions of you
It's all that I see, tell me the truth
Are you thinking of me?

[Verse 2: Trevor Dahl]
Thinking 'bout the time we went away
That's when you became my great escape
Days were passing by, the seasons change
And I hate that I do, but I'm still getting visions of you

[Chorus: Kevin Ford]
Alone in my bed, I can smell the perfume
Get out of my head, these visions of you
It's all that I see, tell me the truth
Are you thinking of me? I'm getting visions of you

[Chorus: Kevin Ford]
I'm getting visions of you
Alone in my bed, I can smell the perfume
Get out of my head, these visions of you
It's all that I see, tell me the truth
Are you thinking of me? I'm getting visions of you
Visions of you, visions of you
Visions of you, I'm getting visions of you

[Chorus: Kevin Ford]
I'm getting visions of you
Alone in my bed, I can smell the perfume
Get out of my head, these visions of you
It's all that I see, tell me the truth
Are you thinking of me? I'm getting visions of you
