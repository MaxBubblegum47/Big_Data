[Verse 1]
I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here's a place you know just as real
It’s just another place you can go
Everything glows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 2]
I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here's a place you know just as real
It's just another place you can go
Everything glows
Looking through the bent backed tulips

[Slurred] half lives

[Gibberish]
Looking through a glass onion

[Gibberish]

[Verse 3]
I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here’s a place you know just as real, ooh
It's just another place you can go
Where, everything glows
(Help!)

[Gibberish] bent backed tulips [gibberish]

[Gibberish] how the other half lives [gibberish]
Looking through a glass onion

[Unintelligible]
