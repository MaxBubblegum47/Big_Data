[Verse 1]
Somewhere between living and dying
Making believe the walls have gone quiet
My soul concedes we'll set it on fire
So I can sleep in smoldering silence

[Pre-Chorus]
Somewhere in between
You and me there's a measure of distance
I can't quite calculate
Somewhere in between
You and me I'll be counting the minutes
'Till I can lie down to wait

[Chorus]
Somewhere in between
In between
You and me, oh
Somewhere in between
In between
You and me, oh

[Verse 2]
Somewhere between your neck and my throat
Hung up in light, the dead, it makes me choke
Kept out of sight
I'll never find glimpses of heaven at night
So cover your eyes
And study the shapes you're creating
Cause baby I'm waiting to find

[Pre-Chorus]
Somewhere in between
You and me there's a measure of distance
I can't quite calculate
Somewhere in between
You and me I'll be counting the minutes
'Till I can lie down to wait

[Chorus]
Somewhere in between
In between
You and me, oh
Somewhere in between
In between
You and me, oh

[Bridge]
Somewhere in between you and me
There's a space, there's a space
I've made
Somewhere in between you and me
There's a line that I drew
Hey

[Chorus]
Somewhere in between
In between
You and me, oh
Somewhere in between
In between
You and me, oh
