One hot angel
One cool devil

Living on the ecstasy
Give it all, give it
Give it what you got
Come on give it all a lot
Pick it up move it
Give it to the spot
Your mind on fantasy
Living on ecstasy

Old school rebel
A ten for the revelry
Diamond of the agency
Shake it, Shake it

Your mind on fantasy
Living on the ecstasy

[Chorus]
Runaway Train

One hot southern belle
Son of a devil
A school boy spelling bee
A school girl with a fantasy
One hot rang a ale
Old school rebel

Diamond of the agency
Shake it, Shake it
Take it to the spot
You know she make it really hot
Get it on, get it up
