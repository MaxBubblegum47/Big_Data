[Verse 1]
Friends come and friends go
As I go round and round
In circles

[Verse 2]
Love warms and love colds
As I go round and round
In circles

[Chorus]
He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
And I go round in circles

[Verse 3]
Life comes and life goes
As we go round and round
In circles

[Chorus]
He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
As I go round in circles

[Verse 4]
Life comes and love goes
As we go round and round
In circles
