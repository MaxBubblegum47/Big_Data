Oh, look over there
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
One that I know since I dont know when
But she dont notice me, when I pass
She goes with all the guys who are out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin to myself
Shes sure fine lookin man, shes something else
Hey, look over there
Across the street
Theres a car just right for me
Took on a quality of luxery
But right now I can't afford the gas
I guessthe cars right out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin to myself
That cars fine lookin man, it something else
Hey, look-a here
Just wait and see
Im gonna work hard and save my dough
Gonna buy the car
Get me that girl and go ridin around
Well go to the shop a right block down
Ill keep on right on dreamin and thinkin to myself
If it all comes true man, wow, thats something else
Look a-here
Whats all this
Never thought Id do this before
But here I am a-knockin on a door
My cars out front
And its all mine
Justa 41 ford not a 59
Ive got that girl and Im a thinkin to myself
Shes sure fine lookin man, wow, shes something else
