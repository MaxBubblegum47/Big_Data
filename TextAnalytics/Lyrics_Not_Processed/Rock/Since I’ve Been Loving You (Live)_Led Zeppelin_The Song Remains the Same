Ahhhhhh, I've been workin' from seven, baby, to eleven every night
Ooh yeah, with miserable a drag, drag, draaaaag
People, I know you don’t think that’s right

Ohh, yes, but I did what I could, yes, I did
Oh, I love you more, yes, I love you, baby

Ah, don't make me lose it

Everybody tryin' to tell me, tell me, ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh
