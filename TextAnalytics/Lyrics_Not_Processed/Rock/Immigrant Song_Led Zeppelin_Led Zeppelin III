[Intro]â€‹
(2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 1]
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 2]
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Verse 3]
So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing
