Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart [laughs]
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a love in my heart
Without a dream in my own [laughs]

And then I suddenly [found loving?] for me
The only one I ever wanted to hold
And then you said you'd come and then you'd adore me
Blue moon, you went to turn to gold

Blue moon
You're no longer alone-- [laughs]
