Won't they be impressed, I am a genius
See how I transform this old rat
Into a most delightful hat

[JACK]
Hmm, my compliments from me to you
On this your most intriguing hat
Consider though this substitute
A bat in place of this old rat, huh!
No, no, no, now that's all wrong
This thing will never make a present
It's been dead for much too long
Try something fresher, something pleasant
Try again, don't give up
