The brightest lights
Cast the darkest shadows
And that's where I'll be found
For what's hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight's hounds
Oh, the Dawn light sweeps all the shadows clean
Of what has gathered in the night
Hang the villains and the crooks
High on butchers hooks
As they run from the sun in fright
Oh the moonlight shadows are fleeting and scattered
Where memories and prophesies are slain
Only the moment you're in can delight in sin
So forget your regrets and pains
The brightest lights
Cast the darkest shadows
And that's where I'll be found
For what's hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight's hounds
Well the twilight shivers as darkness is risen
Cold ash poured over the sun
For the son to rise again he must go through hell
To see what the darkness has done
The depraved and tamed, caught in pleasure's chains;
Willingly surrendering
There's a song to your soul while you bow to gold
The song the angels sing
The brightest lights
Cast the darkest shadows
And that's where I'll be found
For what's hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight's hounds

[x3]
The brightest lights
Cast the darkest shadows
And that's where I'll be found
For what's hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight's hounds
