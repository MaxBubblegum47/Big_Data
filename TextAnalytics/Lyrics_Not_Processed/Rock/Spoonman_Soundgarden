[Verse 1]
Feel the rhythm with your hands
(Steal the rhythm while you can)
Spoonman
Speak the rhythm on your own
(Speak the rhythm all alone)
Spoonman

[Chorus]
Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me

[Verse 2]
All my friends are Indians
(All my friends are brown and red)
Spoonman
All my friends are skeletons
(And beat the rhythm with their bones)
Spoonman

[Chorus]
Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me
Save, save me
Save me, yeah
Save

[Bridge/Guitar Solo]
With your...C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
With your hands
With your hands
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon....hands

[Interlude]
Come on while I get off, come on while I get off
Come on while I get off, come on while I get off
Come on while I get off, come on while I get off
Come on while I get off, come on while I get off!

[Chorus]
Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me
Save, yeah!
Save me
With your, with your hands

[Outro]
Feel the rhythm with your hands
(Steal the rhythm while you can)
Spoonman
