Comin' out of nowhere, drivin' like rain
Stormbringer dance on the thunder again
Dark cloud gathering, breaking the day
No point running 'cause it's coming your way
Ride the rainbow, crack the sky
Stormbringer coming, time to die
You got to keep running, stormbringer coming
He's got nothing you need, he's gonna make you bleed
Oh, I know he's gonna get you
Rainbow shaker on a stallion twister
Bareback rider on the eye of the sky
Stormbringer coming down, meaning to stay
Thunder and lightning heading your way
Ride the rainbow, crack the sky
Stormbringer coming, time to die
You got to keep running, stormbringer coming
He's got nothing you need
He's gonna make you bleed, yes
Hey, you sure [Incomprehensible]
Come on
[Incomprehensible]
Comin' out of nowhere, drivin' like rain
Stormbringer dance on the thunder again
Dark cloud gathering, breaking the day
No point running 'cause it's coming your way
'Cause it's coming your way, 'cause it's coming your way
'Cause it's coming your way, 'cause it's coming your way
Way, way
