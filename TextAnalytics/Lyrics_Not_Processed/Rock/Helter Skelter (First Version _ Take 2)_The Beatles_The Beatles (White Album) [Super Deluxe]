[Intro]
Take 2

[Verse]
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast but i'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
Do you, don't you want me to love you?

[Verse]
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast but i'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

[Verse 2]
Do you, don't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

[Hook]
When i get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the ride
And i know as i get
And i never get high
And i get to the bottom
And i see you again, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse]
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast but i'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

[Chorus]
Look out
Helter skelter
Hell for Leather
Hell for Leather
AAAAAAAAH!

[Verse 3]
Will you won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
May be a lover but you ain't no dancer
Dancer, dancer, dancer, dancer

[Chorus]
Look out now
Helter skelter
Hell for Leather
Hell for Leather

[Hook]
When i get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the hill
When i stop and i turn
And i give you a pill
And a lady that i'm me
Of the bottom again
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Look out now
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter

[Outro]
Do you don't you want me?
