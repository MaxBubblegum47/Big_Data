[Verse 1: Stevie Nicks]
Baby, you'll come knocking on my front door
Same old line you used to use before
I said yeah, well what am supposed to do?
I didn't know what I was getting into

[Chorus 1: Stevie Nicks & Tom Petty]
So you've had a little trouble in town
Now you're keeping some demons down
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around

[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]
It's hard to think about what you've wanted
It's hard to think about what you've lost
This doesn't have to be the big get even
This doesn't have to be anything at all

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Petty]
I know you really wanna tell me goodbye
I know you really wanna be your own girl

[Chorus 2: Stevie Nicks & Tom Petty]
Baby, you could never look me in the eye
Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3: Stevie Nicks]
People running 'round loose in the world
Ain't got nothing better to do
Make a meal of some bright-eyed kid
You need someone looking after you

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Petty]
I know you really wanna tell me goodbye
I know you really wanna be your own girl

[Chorus 2: Stevie Nicks & Tom Petty]
Baby, you could never look me in the eye
Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around

[Outro: Stevie Nicks]
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around
