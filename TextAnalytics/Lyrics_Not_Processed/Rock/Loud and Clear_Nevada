[Verse 1: Da' T.R.U.T.H.]
What happened to you last night
How come you never called back
I was waiting by the phone like Eddie Murphy in boomerang
I guess I gotta fall back
You ever get the last text that I sent, huh
I guess you never saw that
And  what about the post i put it up on your twitter page
All caps
I guess I'm just not your type
You made that crystal last night
But I still love you despite
Can't get rid of me that easy
Ima love you through the night
If that's alright

[Hook: Capital Kings]
Can you hear me loud
Cause I wanna be loud and clear
Can you hear me now
Cause I wanna be loud and clear
Oh (I wanna be, I, I, I wanna be loud and clear)(2x)

[Verse 2: Da' T.R.U.T.H.]
You stood me up again, huh
It was supposed to be a date night
Whats the excuse this time
"Tried to make it but you that it rained on the same night"
This is the thanks that I get
After I gave my life?
After I gave my all
And going out my way for a sacrifice
I guess my all's not enough
All you really wanted was my stuff
That's why I gotta shake things up again
Cause people they tend to come around when it gets tough
But let me turn all the noise down
So you can hear me, listen up

[Hook: Capital Kings]
Can you hear me loud
Cause I wanna be loud and clear
Can you hear me now
Cause I wanna be loud and clear
Oh (I wanna be, I, I, I wanna be loud and clear)(2x)

[Bridge: Da' T.R.U.T.H. &  
Capital Kings

(Loud and clear)(2x)
So if you can hear me listen up
 (Loud and clear)(2x)
I sit in the king's seat
Can you hear me (loud and clear)
I speak to you through the son
And he's very (loud and clear)
You should let the king speak
Can you hear me (loud and clear)
All rise for the king's speech (Can you hear me loud and clear)

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
Uh, I'm all that matters
Cut all that chatter
Working for nothing I already love you
You know it I show it but I'm not your puppet
No sir, can't play me
Cause there's nothing you can do
That can sway me
Separate me cause I love you
Even when your wrong and think I left you alone
Even in your wrongs, I never left my throne
I'm in control and won't let you go

[Hook: Capital Kings]
Can you hear me loud
Cause I wanna be loud and clear
Can you hear me now
Cause I wanna be loud and clear
Oh (I wanna be, I, I, I wanna be loud and clear)(2x)
