[Verse 1]
All the little gifts you gave
I call it over compensating
Feeling just like a princess
Every answer was always yes
You had me living in a dream
What’s forever long to you
Did you say that to her too
Making sure that I’d never know
Callin her while the shower goes
Then crawl back in bed it's a shame

[Pre-Chorus]
I probably should’ve known better
I probably should’ve known better
Every word you said you was sweet but you was lying
Everything you covered up, making up just to keep to me from crying

[Chorus]
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
The truth is you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad bad bad
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
Truth is you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad bad bad

[Verse 2]
I wasn’t catching on to you
Blinded by your lips so smooth
Excusing all of your gotta goes
Leaving me to be all alone
Then you took my heart just the same

[Pre-Chorus]
I probably should’ve known better
I probably should’ve known better
Every word you said you was sweet but you was lying
Everything you covered making up just to keep to me from crying

[Chorus]
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
The truth is you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad bad bad
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
Truth is you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad bad bad

[Bridge]
Tell me the truth
Was it worth it was I worth it for you
Cus we were perfect we working til you
Forgot to tell me you been seeing someone else for six years

[Chorus]
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
The truth is you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad bad bad
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
Truth is you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad bad bad
