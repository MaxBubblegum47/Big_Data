[Verse 1]
Seven years of hard luck, coming down on me
From the Florida border, yes up to Nashville Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name, mister every honky tonk
Along come Mr. Yankee Slicker, saying maybe you're what I want

[Chorus]
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' For MCA

[Verse 2]
9000 dollars, that's all we could win
But we smiled at the Yankee Slicker with a big ol' Southern grin
They're gonna take me out to California gonna make me a superstar
Just pay me all my money, mister, maybe you won't get a scar

[Chorus]
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' For MCA

[Electric Piano and Guitar solos]

[Verse 3]
Oh suckers took my money since I was seventeen
If it ain't no pencil pusher, then it got to be a honky tonk queen
But I'll sign my contract baby, and I want you people to know
That every penny that I make, I'm gonna see where my money goes

[Chorus]
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' For MCA
