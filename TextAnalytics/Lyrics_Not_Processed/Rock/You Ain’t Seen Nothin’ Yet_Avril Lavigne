[Verse 1]
First glance, you nearly made my jaw drop
First dance, and you were looking so hot
Held hands and moved in for a lip lock
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby
At first taste, like honey, you were so yum
Can't wait for a second 'cause it's so fun
Third base and headed for a homerun
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby, now

[Chorus]
Hold on tight
To this rollercoaster ride
And if you're lovin' this, just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet
And just let go
If you don't, we'll never know
So if you're lovin' this, just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet

[Verse 2]
My place, you showed up with flowers
Your face, could stare at it for hours
Can't wait to see your superpowers
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby
Your car, I'm sitting right beside you
A rockstar at everything that you do
My heart is ready for the next move
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby, now

[Chorus]
Hold on tight
To this rollercoaster ride
And if you're lovin' this, just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet
And just let go
If you don't, we'll never know
So if you're lovin' this, just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet

[Bridge]
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on tight

[Chorus]
Hold on tight
To this rollercoaster ride
And if you're lovin' this, just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet
And just let go
If you don't, we'll never know
So if you're lovin' this, just give me one more kiss
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet ('Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet)
Yeah, yeah, not yet
Yeah, yeah, not yet
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, not yet (Just let go)
Yeah, yeah, not yet (If you don't, we'll never know)
Yeah, yeah, not yet (So if you're lovin' this, just give me one more kiss)
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet
