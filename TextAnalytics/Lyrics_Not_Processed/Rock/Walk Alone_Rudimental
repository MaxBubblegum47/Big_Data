[Verse 1]
Showed up at the right time
In a broke down limousine
All you had was red lights
I went and turned them all to green
I found you in the landslide
And pulled you out again
The hardest conversations
Are the ones you never had
Well you don't have to say it
'Cause you know I understand
Never been the bravest
But if you need a hand

[Pre-Chorus]
I got two, baby
If you're in trouble I got you, baby
Nothing that I wouldn't do, baby
And you know, you know that

[Chorus]
I am a rock, I am a stone (Oh-oh-oh)
I'll be your strength, I'll be your home (Oh-oh-oh)
And you may walk a lonely road
But you will never walk, walk, walk alone
You will never walk, walk, walk alone
You will never walk, walk, walk alone
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
I don't have the answers
But I can listen for a while
Might not understand it
But I can try to make you smile
When you're in a black place
And need a shoulder you can cry on

[Pre-Chorus]
I got two, baby
If you're in trouble I got you, baby
Nothing that I wouldn't do, baby
And you know, you know that

[Chorus]
I am a rock, I am a stone (Oh, I am a stone)
I'll be your strength, I'll be your home (Oh, I'll be your home)
And you may walk a lonely road
But you will never walk, walk, walk alone
You will never walk, walk, walk alone
You will never walk, walk, walk alone
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa
You know, you know

[Bridge]
I am a rock, I am a stone
I'll be your strength, I'll be your home
And you may walk a lonely road

[Chorus]
But you will never walk, walk, walk alone
(You will never walk alone)
You will never walk, walk, walk alone
(You will never walk alone)
You will never walk, walk, walk alone
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa
(Oh, no, no, no)

[Outro]
'Cause I am a rock, I am a stone, oh
And I'll be your strength, I'll be your home
And you may walk a lonely road
But you will never walk, walk, walk alone
