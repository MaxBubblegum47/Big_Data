[Verse 1: Avril Lavigne]
Love that once hung on the wall
Used to mean something
But now it means nothing
The echoes are gone in the hall
But I still remember
The pain of December

[Pre-Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry, it's too late

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & Chad Kroeger]
I'm breakin' free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye, set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go

[Post-Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger]
You came back to find I was gone
And that place is empty
Like the hole that was left in me
Like we were nothing at all
It's not what you meant to me
Thought we were meant to be

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger with Avril Lavigne]
Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say (Left you could say)
I'm sorry, it's too late

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & Chad Kroeger]
I'm breakin' free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye, set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go

[Bridge: Avril Lavigne & (Chad Kroeger)]
I let it go (And now I know)
A brand new life (Is down this road)
And when it's right (You always know)
So this time (I won't let go)

[Pre-Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
There's only one thing left here to say
Love's never too late

[Chorus: Avril Lavigne & Chad Kroeger]
I've broken free from those memories
I've let it go, I've let it go
And two goodbyes led to this new life
Don't let me go, don't let me go

[Post-Chorus: Avril Lavigne]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

[Outro: Avril Lavigne]
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
