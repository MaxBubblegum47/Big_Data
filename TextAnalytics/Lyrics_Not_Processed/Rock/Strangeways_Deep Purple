[Intro]
Strange ways
Strange[x2]

[Verse 1]
I was born into confusion
My mother said to me
When you become a man you'll understand
But it's still a mystery
And if you want to get ahead
Get some decent clothes
The only way to make it
Dress the part that gets right up my nose

[Chorus]
And I think to myself in this river of doubt
This is something I can do without
But, strange ways is what I got
Strange ways

[Verse 2]
The Indians are coming
I saw it on TV
They're twenty thousand strong
But they always get depleted by the cavalry
Salvation is at hand
It's guaranteed
Just send a donation straight to God
One eight hundred, toll free

[Chorus]
And I think to myself in this academy of fear
Where am I going, what am I doing here?
But strange ways is all I got
Strange ways

[Bridge]
Aaa, aaa[x3]

[Verse 3]
Have you seen the headlines?
Princess engaged
Three million out of work
But that's on the second page
The alien has landed
Finger in his ear
Can't hear a word I am saying
But that isn't such a bad idea

[Chorus]
And I think to myself in this cradle of lust
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
But strange ways is all you get
Strange ways
