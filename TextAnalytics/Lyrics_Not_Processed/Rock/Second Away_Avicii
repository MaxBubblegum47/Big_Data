[Chorus]
Oh, miracle around the corner
I know a change is coming for ya
And it's all just a second away
See it over the horizon
Leave it to [?]

[Refrain]
And it's all just a second away
Ooh, ooh
Guess it's all just a second away

[Verse 1]
Give me a second of your time
'cause I got something on my mind
And I know you don't want to hear it
Take your hands [?]
If your listening to me
The white lies, the stories
Just make it true this time
Ooh, just a second away
And I think about it night and day
We could make a change in our lives
Ooh, why you throw it away
We could make it right today
We could make a change in our lives

[Chorus]
Miracles around the corner
I know a change is coming for ya
And it's all just a second away
See it over the horizon
Leave it to [?]

[Refrain]
And it's all just a second away
Ooh, ooh
Guess it's all just a second away

[Outro]
Oh, just a second away
And I think about it night and day
We could make a change in our lives
Oh, just a second away
And I think about it night and day
We could make a change in our lives
Oh, just a second away
And I think about it night and day
Only a second away
Oh, oh
