[Intro]
Here's a tale of Tom
Who worked the railroads long
His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel

[Chorus]
Poor Tom, seventh son
Always knew what was going on
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

[Verse 1]
Worked for thirty years
Sharing hopes and fears
Dreaming of the day
He could turn and say

[Chorus]
Poor Tom, work is done
Been lazing out in the noonday sun
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

[Verse 2]
His wife was Annie Mae
With any man a game she would play
When Tom was out of town
She couldn't keep her dresses down

[Chorus]
Poor Tom, seventh son
Always knew what was going on
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

[Verse 3]
And so it was one day
People got to Annie Mae
Tom stood, a gun in his hand
And stopped her running around

[Chorus]
Poor Tom, seventh son
Gotta die for what you have done
All those years of work are thrown away
To ease your mind is that all you can say?

[Outro]
But what about that grandson on your knee?
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me

Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

Hey
Keep-a truckin'
Keep-a truckin'
Hey
