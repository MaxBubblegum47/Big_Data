[Verse 1]
I remember when I first heard your heartbeat
It had only been eight weeks
Standin' there, starin' at that screen, was the
First time you ever scared me
God knows I don't know
Exactly what I'm doin', but
Good news, we got her to get through it

[Chorus]
I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady
Hmm-hmm

[Verse 2]
I can make you laugh 'til you cry
But she can make your tears dry, and
When you get your heart broke by the wrong guy
She can make it right

[Chorus]
I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Hmm-hmm
Just how to be a lady
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
She'll hear you
She'll hold you
She'll help you through
She'll fix you
And me too

[Chorus]
I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do (Love her like I do)
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move (Every move)
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady
