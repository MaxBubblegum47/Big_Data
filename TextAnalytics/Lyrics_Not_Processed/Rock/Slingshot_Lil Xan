[Intro]
You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat
Yeah, ayy

[Verse]
I like lean, I like drugs
I like beans, I got plugs
What you need? No, no fronts
What you bleed? Oh, you tough
Heard my raps, they like, "Nah"
Now they ask what my price
I'm like, "No, outta sight"
I'm like, "Yeah, outta sight"
I might stay M.I.A
I might go M.I.A
I might stay M.I.A
I might go M.I.A
Please, stay the fuck away
That's my shit, stay away
I got Low on my face
All these clothes, but no Bape
I got hoe outta state
I got weed for the low
I don't pop fucking Xans
I might pop a norco
We ain't with no fuck shit
We ain't 'round no fuck shit
We ain't with no fuck shit
We ain't 'round no fuck shit, fuck

[Interlude]
Nah, we ain't really 'round no fuck shit
Know I stay

[Chorus]
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit, yeah
Fuck that shit, fuck that shit
Fuck that shit like yeah, ayy
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch like yeah, ayy
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch (You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat)
Fuck that bitch like wha, yeah

[Outro]
Out the booth
