[Chorus]
Yeah, I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, a love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, a love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, a love to hold

[Post Chorus]
Love
It's been getting me down
Been looking so hard
Around these towns
Ain't easy to get
And so hard to keep
The harder I try
The harder it seems

[Chorus x2]
I've been trying to find myself
A love to hold, love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, love to hold

I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, a love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, a love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, a love to hold

[Post-Chorus]
Love
It's been getting me down
Been looking so hard
Around these towns
Ain't easy to get
And so hard to keep
The harder I try
The harder it seems

[Chorus]
I've been trying to find myself
A love to hold, love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, love to hold
I've been trying to find myself
Love to hold, love to hold
