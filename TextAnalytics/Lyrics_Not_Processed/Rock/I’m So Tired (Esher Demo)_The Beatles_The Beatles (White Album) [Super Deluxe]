[Intro]
...2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
And ya know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
(Woo!)

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

[Bridge]
When I hold you in your arms
When you show each one of your charms
I wonder, should I get up
And go to the funny farm
No, no, no

[Outro]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
And I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind (woo!)
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind (woo!)
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
(Woo, baby!) (Give you everything) I've got
For a little peace of mind
(I'd give you everything I've got, Derek)
