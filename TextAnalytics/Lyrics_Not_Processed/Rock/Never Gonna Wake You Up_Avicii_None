Once upon a time
Not so long ago
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
I get knocked down
But I get up again
I-I-I
(3x)
I get knocked down
But I get up again
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You’re never gonna keep down
(8x)
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
(and hurt you) (4x)
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You’re never gonna keep down
(8x)
(get, get, get)
Get down, get down
I-I-I-I
I get knocked down
Keep me knocked down
I-I-I-I
I get down, get down
I-I-I-I
I get knocked down
Keep me knocked down
You’re never gonna keep down
