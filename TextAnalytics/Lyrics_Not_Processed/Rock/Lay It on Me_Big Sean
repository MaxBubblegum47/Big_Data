[Intro: Big Sean & Hit-Boy]
Yeah, boy
Down, down, down
Boi, boi, boi
Kelly, I'ma make you call me B-I-G

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Last night we made a movie, and tonight will be the sequel
Send a pic, let a nigga get a preview
Come and suit it up, on my GQ
And I'ma make you take it off with your teeth too
Nasty, tonight we skinny dipping, no pool girl
Except the one between your legs, I'm a fool girl
Put your skirt on, turn you to my school girl
Smack you with my ruler girl, you know how I do it, girl

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
What time do you get out? I wanna see you tonight
What time will you be here? I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna just kiss you now
I wanna just touch you now
I wanna just give you all my love tonight
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
And tell 'em you won't be here in the morning, oh no
Tell your little friends that you're rolling solo
Tonight boy, make my body go, oh
Lay it on me

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, lay it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lay it on me

[Verse 3: Kelly Rowland]
I don't mind, I can wait up
Cause I'mma enjoy the ride
And I know when you show up, I'mma be satisfied
So come, come lay me down
One more time around
Boy, just give me all that love tonight
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
And tell 'em you won't be here in the morning, oh no
Tell your little friends that you're rolling solo
Tonight boy, make my body go, oh
Lay it on me

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh

Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, lay it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lay it on me

[Bridge: Kelly Rowland & (Big Sean)]
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down
Oh, oh, lay it down
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down (Lay it down)
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down (B-I, talk that nasty shit)
Lay it down, d-down down, d-down down, down (Sean Don)
Oh, lay it on me (yeah)

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
The king of the California kings, you gotta call me sire
Watch me lay it down, and I ain't even tired
Putting work in and I ain't even hired
Hitting high notes, neighbours thought you joined a choir
She drop it then wind with it 'cause she know that I'm liking it
Turn my lap into a chaffeur and I'll spend all day just riding it
Tryna clone that just to have a m√©nage with it
Just a red light special, but I swear there ain't no stopping this
Yelling go Sean go, said shawty bring it back
Call my dick "Curiosity" 'cause it killed the cat
And satisfaction brought it back
Girl, it's your world, I'm just chilling on the map

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & (Big Sean)]
Lay it down
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me (I do it)
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh (B-I-G)
Lay it on me (Sean Don)
Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body (yeah)
Lay it on me, lay it on me
Lay it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, lay it on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah (B-I-G, Kelly)
Lay it on me
