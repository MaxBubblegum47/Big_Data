[Verse 1]
Bright light almost blinding
Black night still there shining
I can't stop keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend she once told me
"You got love, you ain't lonely"
Now she's gone and left me only
Looking for what I knew

[Verse 2]
Met a man on the roadside dying
Without a friend‚ there's no denying
You're incomplete‚ they'll be no finding
Looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down‚ altho' it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew
