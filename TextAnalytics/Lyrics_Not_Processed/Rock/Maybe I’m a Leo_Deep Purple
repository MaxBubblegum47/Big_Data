[Verse 1]
Creeping round my door, I got a big surprise
Couldn't see a thing but open skies

[Bridge]
They've taken her away
Where is she now?

[Verse 2]
Wish that she was here, I wish she'd hold my hand
Maybe she would laugh, maybe understand

[Bridge]
Why was I so cruel?
Where is she now?

[Guitar Solo]
{Organ Solo}

[Verse 3]
Acting like a fool, I had to make her cry
Maybe I'm a leo but I ain't a lion

[Bridge]
I'm hurtin' for her so bad
I want her now
