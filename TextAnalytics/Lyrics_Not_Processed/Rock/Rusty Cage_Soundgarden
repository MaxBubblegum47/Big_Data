[Verse 1]
You wired me awake
And hit me with a hand of broken nails
You tied my lead and pulled my chain
To watch my blood begin to boil

[Chorus]
But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
Yeah, I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage
And run

[Verse 2]
Too cold to start a fire
I'm burning diesel, burning dinosaur bones
I'll take the river down to Stillwater
And ride a pack of dogs

[Chorus]
But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
Yeah, I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage
And run

[Bridge]
Hits like a Phillips head into my brain
It's gonna be too dark to sleep again
Cutting my teeth on bars and rusty chains
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run

[Verse 3]
When the forest burns along the road
Like God's eyes in my headlights
When the dogs are looking for their bones
And it's raining icepicks on your steel shore

[Chorus]
Well, I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
Well, I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage
And run
