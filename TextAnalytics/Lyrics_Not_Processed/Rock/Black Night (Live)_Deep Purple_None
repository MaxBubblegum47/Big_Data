Here we go
It's a thing called Black Night
Black night is not right
I don't feel so bright
I don't care to sit tight
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free, free to be me
Black night is a long way from home
Yeah, uh
I don't need a dark tree
I don't want a rough sea
I can't feel, I can't see
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free, free to be me
Black night is a long way from home
Oh, yeah
Hooh yeah, alright
- Right on John
Yeah
- Yeah, come on
Black night, black night
I don't need black night
I can't see dark light
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
That I'm free, free to be me
Black night is a long way from home
Ah, yeah yeah, oh
- Yeah, thank you, thank you all
Thank you and God bless you
