[Verse 1]
Don't turn off the light you might draw the Queen of Spades
Don't shut the door you don't need to be alone
I won't bring you no food
There might be some poison in your meat

[Chorus]
I've got to know are you dead or alive
Don't shut the door are you dead or alive
Dead or alive
Pick your window you're leaving

[Verse 2]
Don't look in the mirror with a dollar up your face
You've got money to burn cheap at half the price
Oh, don't powder your nose
Don't blow your brains just for the the crack

[Chorus]
I've got to know are you dead or alive
Just for the crack are you dead or alive
Dead or alive, yea
Pick your window you're leaving

[Verse 3]
You're running so fast but you know you're standing still
I'm afraid of your shadow and the knife in it's hand
You're dancing with death to the tune of the dealer
And he don't care, don't give a toss

[Outro]
Don't want to know if you're dead or alive[x2]
Dead or alive, dead or alive
Pick your window you're leaving
