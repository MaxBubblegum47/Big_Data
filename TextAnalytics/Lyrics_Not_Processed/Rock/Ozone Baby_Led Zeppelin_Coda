[Verse 1]
I hear ya knock on my door
I ain't been saving this scene for ya honey
Don't want you ringing my bell
It's too late for you to be my honey

[Chorus]
Ooh, it's my love
Ooh, it's my own true love
Ooh, it's my love
Ooh, it's my own true love
My own

[Verse 2]
Don't want you wasting my time
Tired of ya doing the things that you do
It's no use standing in line
Follow the line, you better follow queue

[Chorus]
I say, ooooh, it's my love
Oooh, it's my own true love
I say, ooooh, it's my love
Oooh, it's my own true love
My own

[Verse 3]
I could sail a river run dead, but I know it's dead
I could I wish for a million, yeah, but I know it's dead
I could cry within the darkness, I sail away
I save a lifetime forever
But you know, you know, you know what I say

[Outro]
And I say Ooh, it's my love
Oooh, it's my own true love
