[Verse 1]
I've waited many years
Every print I left upon the track
Has led me here
And next year, it'll be clear
This was only leading me to that
And by that time, I hope that

[Chorus]
You love me
You love me

[Verse 2]
I move with the trees in the breeze
I know that time is elastic
And I know when I go
All my particles disband and disperse
And I'll be back in the pulse
And I know none of this will matter in the long run
But I know a sound is still a sound around no one
And while I'm in this body
I want somebody to want
And I want what I want and I want

[Chorus]
You to love me
You

[Bridge]
And I know that you do
In the dark, I know that you do
And I know that you know that you got
The potential to pick me up
And I want you to use it, blast the music
Bang it, bite it, bruise it
Whenever you want to begin, begin
We don't have to go back to where we've been
I am the woman who wants you to win
And I've been waiting, waiting for

[Outro]
You to love me
You
You
Ooh, ooh
