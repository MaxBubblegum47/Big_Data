[Intro]
Hey, everybody
It's about being yourself and stickin' up for it
Step up, step up (huh, huh)
Step up, step up (huh, huh)
Step up, step up (huh, huh)

[Verse 1]
Fall back
Take a look at me, and you see I'm for real
I feel what only I can feel
And if that don't appeal to you, let me know
And I'll go, 'cause I flow
Better when my colors show
And that's the way it has to be, honestly
'Cause creativity could never bloom in my room
I'd throw it all away before I lie
So don't call me with a compromise
Hang up the phone
I got a backbone stronger than yours

[Pre-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
If you're tryna turn me into somethin' else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that
I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryna turn me into somethin' else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that, yeah
I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down
Go ahead and try
Go ahead

[Verse 2]
You don't know
You think you know me like yourself, but I fear
That you're only telling me what I wanna hear
But do you give a damn?
Understand that I can't not be what I am
I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon
It's not a simple "here we go," not so soon
I might've fallen for that when I was fourteen
And a little more green
But it's amazing what a couple of years can mean

[Pre-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
If you're tryna turn me into somethin' else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that, uh
I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryna turn me into somethin' else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that (yeah)
I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down
Go ahead and try
Try

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Go ahead and try
Try to look me in the eye
Until you see inside
But you'll never realize, realize
Things are tryin' to settle down
Just tryna figure out
Exactly what I'm about
If it's with or without you
I don't need you doubtin' me

[Chorus]
If you're tryna turn me into somethin' else
It's easy to see I'm not down with that, no
I'm not nobody's fool
If you're tryna turn me into somethin' else
I've seen it enough and I'm over that, yeah
I'm not nobody's fool (not nobody's fool)
If you wanna bring me down
Go ahead and try
Try

[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, oh, oh yeah
Would you be laughing out loud
If I played to my own crowd?
Try, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Go ahead and try (woo!)
How's everybody doin' tonight?
