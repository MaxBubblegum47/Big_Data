[Verse 1]
Well, I'm heading on out
Down to a major town
I'm getting hungry
I'm getting mean
I'm getting down on easy street

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad luck
I get by

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling tough
I'm getting wild

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in town
Ready to go
I'll be around
And then I'll let you know

[Chorus]
I got some rock and roll thunder
Some rock and roll thunder
Yes

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
I been working
Need bankroll
I get high on rock and roll
I get the beat, babe, on easy street
I don't need a handgun
I got it made

[Pre-Chorus]
Down on your luck?
I'll get you a round

[Verse 4]
I'm here to help you
Show you what I found

[Pre-Chorus]
Tailor made for ya
The party is in town
I'm tailor made for you
Come see what I have found

[Chorus]
I got some rock and roll thunder
I got some rock and roll thunder
Hey, hey, what do you know?
I said, feeling great and ready to roll
I got the rock and roll thunder

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Solo]

[Chorus]
I got some rock and roll thunder
Got rock and roll thunder
Hey, hey what do you know?
I said, feeling great and a-ready to roll
I got the rock and roll thunder
The rock and roll thunder
I said, my rock and roll thunder
Rock and roll thunder
