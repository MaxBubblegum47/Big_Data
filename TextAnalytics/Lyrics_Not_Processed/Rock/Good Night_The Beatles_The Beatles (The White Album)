[Verse 1]
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

[Bridge]
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight

[Bridge]
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

[Instrumental bridge]
Mmm

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

[Bridge]
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

[Outro]
Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody, everywhere
Good night
