[Chorus]
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

[Verse]
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

[Chorus]
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

[Bridge]
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh

[Verse]
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

[Bridge]
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh

[Verse]
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
You know, they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

[Chorus]
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine
