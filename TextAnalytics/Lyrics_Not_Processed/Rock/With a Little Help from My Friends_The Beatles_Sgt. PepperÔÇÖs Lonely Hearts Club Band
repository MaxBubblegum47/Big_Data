[Segue: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr]
Billy Shears!

[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr & Lennon/McCartney/Harrison]
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr & Lennon/McCartney/Harrison]
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Verse 3: Ringo Starr & Lennon/McCartney/Harrison]
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr & Lennon/McCartney/Harrison]
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Outro: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
