[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
I been stuck in the struggle
And I been wonderin' if I'm ever gon' bubble
I'm gettin' caught up in a tussle
Instead of usin' my muscle
And everytime I extend my heart to my mother
Caught up in the game, now I'm back up in the hustle
Sometimes I sit and I wonder
If a nigga pull my number if it wasn't for the Bone Thug fam'
In this world where nobody don't give a damn
But I'm still a man, got us all programmed
I'ma pump my fist, I'm stayin' ready for this
And you can put this on Wish, I never seen the abyss
And when I needed a ride, you wouldn't give me a lift
And now I'm poppin' my Cris, you niggas all on my dick
I wanna change the world, you wanna change your life
I wouldn't a put up a fight if I knew it was trite
They say everything happen for a reason
Can you tell me why there's niggas bleedin'?
Needin' general assistance out here, needin' public housing
Out here tryna make ends meet
Tryna get on their feet, but see, your brain is so cloudy
And I know what you don't know
You better get on your mission and get down for your dough
See, the real niggas ready out here taken control
See, I'm screamin' out Mo', with my pockets on swoll
Please Mr. Postman, quit bringin' these bills to my house
Quit bringin' this stress to my spouse
'Cause I'm ready for the kill on look out, look out
If you niggas try to run up on the Bone
I'ma show you like this, I'ma pull out my chrome
I don't wanna have to send a nigga home
Lord, please take me home, come and take me home!

[Hook: Phil Collins]
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember

[Interlude: Krazyie Bone]
Home, home, home, home, home
Home, home, home, home, home
Please take me home

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
When I'm lookin' at my money now
Thinkin' back to when I was livin' foul
I was runnin' wild, sur-vi-ving, 
'cause I'm 9-to-5'ing
Even puttin' overtime if I had to grind
I was stayin' up, slangin' dubs, hangin' up on the block
Duckin' and dodgin' the cops clocked on the night-shift
Didn't think I'd ever make it out, out, out of the ghetto
But we finally made it
Stay dedicated to the music we made, yeah
Now it's on Bone Thug, leave alone
Came back the next year, #1 platinum song
It blew up from the doorâ€”and what do you know?
(Oh no) 
Eazy, rest his soul
Left us in the mess, I don't regret it
But we better get up and get it, go
Everything's gon' wrong, since you left Bone
It never been right, I knew it woulda been on
We woulda been tight, we woulda been in the zone
Ridin' so high, up in the game: five thugs live
See, we used to love makin' music
We was always in the studio, groovin'
We kept it movin', we was ready to do it
Right? But you know I'm goin' through it
And ain't feelin this rap thing right now
They got me trippin' ready to flip
They got me trippin' ready to come get my chips
They got me trippin' loadin' the clips
They trippin', Lord, I feel like I'm losin' it
Right now, right now, now, now

[Hook: Phil Collins]
So, take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
I'll never give in, I'll never give up
I'll let 'em live in, they sinnin', they pretend to be tough
Pretend to be tough, pretend to be blessed
They want money and women, it's never enough
They in a rush, hope nobody knows just too much
You better be good, you know up in the hood
And so, we give 'em the dough, fired out, laughin' up
When niggas died, niggas brought around nasty junk
And to the grave, I been one of the brave
Not one of the slaves, one of the paid
And I'll be one of the same, stay hatin' the fake
On the television, runnin' around
Tellin' niggas be ready for hate
Guard Leathaface and the grin right up under my face
I steady debate the pain that I bring with hate
Sweet as the cake, I take another puff and shake
The smell of right it's all about guardin', guard the weak
Lost mommy, poppy left home
I miss Wish' Uncle Charlie
Sit list in the back tellin' his selection, his date is probly
Probly my mommy's song
Cryin' for the life of you gone
Just me and my destiny, let's roll, let's roll

[Hook: Phil Collins]
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
When I lost my Uncle Charle a part of me went wrong
And it happened when the Bone was comin' up so strong
We just wanted him to see what we do
You motivated us at the shows we see too
And I really hope you live through what we spit on the song
You mighta been through somethin', hopin' nothin' like Bone
Like one said we'll never make it
Like two, thirty mil in they faces
And I really thought it was over, put us on and you left
Crossed over, back to the hood, we soldiers
The music nigga make it back, scandalous
But faith kicked in and the work shows that we winnin' now
Gotta keep it comin' food in my baby mouth
And things have changed like relationships
Ain't did nothin', now you wanna flip
Suin' people thangs you would've never made on your own
Now I wanna stay, watch thug niggas leave the hood
Bye, think I'm home
Stick in the hood, mess with scrubs, it'll all be gone
You can really help a busta if it ain't meant to be
With a little oohwee, with a little oohwee
I'm tired of tryin' to help these thugs
Lord, just guide em' home, guide 'em home!

[Hook: Phil Collins]
So, take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
Ohhh Looord
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
