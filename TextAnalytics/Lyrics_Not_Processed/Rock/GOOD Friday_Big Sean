[Intro: Kanye West]
Party people in the place to be
You are now in the midst of a real emcee
Throw your hands in the air if you real as me
Oooooooh! OW!

[Hook: Kid Cudi, 
Charlie Wilson
, & 
Kanye West
]
Ugh, ugh, la-la-la
 (
Hey, ugh
)
La la la la-la
La la la la-la
(
They say, ahh
) Are you
(
La la la,
 
ayy
) Ready to go?
(
La la la la-la
) I know the city getting ready for me
(
La la la la-la
) I know the city getting ready

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Such an easy morning, we on a ride
And I'm feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They don’t want black people to think and drive

[Verse 2: Common & 
Common & Kanye West
]
He think he live, he think he cold
He think I’m high, I’m in thinker mode
Eyes lowed, I let the sky hold the thoughts
The streets are like the high road that I go across, ugh

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that it’s Fashion Week
And the weather was unbearably hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music, and forever we hot?

[Hook: Kid Cudi, 
Kanye West
, & 
Kid Cudi & Kanye West
]
Are you
Motherfucker, are you ready or not?
Ready to go? (
Ugh
)
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you
Ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

[Bridge: Kanye West & 
Charlie Wilson
]
This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop (Can’t stop!)
You... can’t stop!
This goes out to the all core hip-hop (Can’t stop)
La la la la-la
You... can’t stop!
La la la la-la

[Verse 4: Pusha T & 
Kid Cudi
]
As Ye flips the piano
The mood swings like the change of a channel
He’s heating up like they wrapped him in flannel
Selling kilos through your iPod Nano
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal
Money drive you crazy—look at Marbury’s handle
Vaseline face,
 reminiscent of my tires
Ice cream paint job, something like Breyer's
Euro tank top, Dior-inspired
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required
Yuugh! On 2012 in 2010
Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz
Floss for the members of the gang with the 20 in
Are you
While haters wish death upon me, that’s many men
Ready to go
Yeah, and if he slam you on your paper route
I know the city getting ready for me
Stop talking, motherfucker, pull your paper out
I know the city getting ready for me

[Verse 5  Big Sean & 
Kanye West
]
Now tell me, do it feel good? Well, all right
Don’t worry, we gon' be here all night
And you know a nigga rep that Westside (
Hanh?
)
Westside (
Hanh?
), Westside
So t—t—tell me, who the freshest of them all?
They claiming that they fresh, they ain’t fresher than my balls
A nigga suited fresh like I'm headed to the ball
Emcee hunting season, putting heads up on the wall
I sneak-peeked ahead while we headed to the loft
Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers
I guess that's why in school
My grades went from A's to B's to Cs
All over double-Ds, I be absent all week
This is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for (My niggas)
Man, that’s the fam, we let ‘em in through the side door
Hold on, that’s the girl you gave a wedding ring? (What?)
Man, me and my niggas nutted on her everything (Haha)

[Drum Break]

[Interlude: Charlie Wilson]
And let me hear you say, "Ahh"
La la la

And let me hear you say, "Ahh" (Ahh)
La-la-la (Oh, yeah)
La-la-la-la-la (Oh, oh, oh)
La-la-la-la-la (Ooh wee)

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
Now, put your hands up to the sky
Until the day in that we die
And we'll be here all evening
G.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend
