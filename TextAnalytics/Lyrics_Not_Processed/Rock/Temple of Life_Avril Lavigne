[Verse 1]
We sat by the fire
United in song
Under the moonlight
All night long
We sang 'Hallelujah'
For the joy of it all

[Verse 2]
And out on the water
A caroling loon
Sings us a sweet
Heavenly tune
There's peace in Gods forest
The temple of life

[Chorus]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Hallelujah

[Verse 3]
And back in the city
I'm losing control
I need a place
To ease my soul
There's peace in God's temple
The temple of life

[Chorus]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Hallelujah

[Bridge]
Thank you Jesus
We praise your name
Thank you Lord
Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Hallelujah
