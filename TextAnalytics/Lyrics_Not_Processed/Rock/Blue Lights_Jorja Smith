[Intro]
I wanna turn those blue lights into strobe lights
Not blue flashing lights, maybe fairy lights
Those blue lights into strobe lights
Maybe even fairy lights, not blue flashing lights

[Verse 1]
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
You better not run 'cause the sirens not coming for you
What have you done?
You went to school that day
Was a bit late but it was a Monday
Kept after class for answering back
You apologized, ain't no harm in that?

[Chorus]
(I wanna turn those blue lights)
What have you done?
(Into strobe lights)
There's no need to run
(Not blue flashing lights)
If you've done nothing wrong
(Maybe fairy lights)
Blue lights should just pass you by

[Verse 2]
Gun crime into your right ear
Drugs and violence into your left
Default white headphones flooding the auditory
Subconscious waves you accept
You're sitting on the 4 back home
"Where you at, G? Answer your phone!"
Paused the poison to answer his message
Your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence

[Chorus]
(I wanna turn those blue lights)
What have you done?
(Into strobe lights)
There's no need to run
(Not blue flashing lights)
If you've done nothing wrong
(Maybe fairy lights)
Blue lights should just pass you by

[Verse 3]
Tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
Shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?
But the face on your boy casts a darker picture
Of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper;
"Look blud, I'm sorry, 'cause I know you got my back
He was running, I couldn't think, I had to get out of that"
Not long ago you were miming to the "Shook Ones"
Now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship
How's man like you gonna make me a convict?
Level of a felon when I've done nothing wrong
Blood on my hands but I don't know where it's from, oh
You got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from

[Bridge]
You better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
'Cause they will be coming for you
Run when you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
The blue lights are coming for you

[Chorus]
(I wanna turn those blue lights)
What have you done?
(Into strobe lights)
There's no need to run
(Not blue flashing lights)
If you've done nothing wrong
(Maybe fairy lights)
Blue lights should just pass you by

"Blud, when you hear the sirens coming"
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
"Blud, when you hear the sirens coming"
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
What have you d-d-d-done done
Don't you run
Don't you run
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
