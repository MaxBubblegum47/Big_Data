[Intro: Dominic Fike]
You got room in your phone for one more distraction
Wonderful times
Time is moving too slow for me to distract you
I need to get back to you

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
All my friends, all my dawgs that I got back home
We would look up at the sky, we was 10 years old
I'm my brother's keeper, let these demons show
Southern blood run deep so that genius grow
From the trees I hang, so low way go
Bands awake us from a slumber, yeah, dawg, I know
These petty motherfuckers don't know 'bout Big Moe
Rest in peace my nigga Luke, this a test of shit for sure
My brother Chris put me on and I will never take that from him
No matter how many times he called me "faggot" in the morning
Best thing 'bout being Mormon was seeing the white boy storm
And it's not my fault I like y'all, can't really explain it
Became the hood's favorite, I'm not ever a main bitch
My nigga, I'm just like SZA, they listen so I deliver
They found out my name was Clifford, I hide it, sometimes I'm lying
I'm tired of fucking crying and hiding behind a dummy, can I?

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling outside of your window

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I feel better with you
Telling you now, don't tell on the crew
Bet your loot hot, they tell you to move
Hollywood, I wish my brother would shoo
Take me back to my other issue
Was plastered with truth, feet on the roof
Drug in my veins, they shot up the place
My bro was an answer, then I was the glue
I don't think that they will ever get through
You see me standing there, heavyweight shoe
Me and my bro ain't never gon' choose
We on the loose, hands out the roof
Hand me my dro, I hand you your bag
All of my siblings end up like they dad
I remember what them charges was like
I don't want to be their burden tonight

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract & 
Ryan Beatty
]
The weight on my shoulders, I just can't get over
He won't take me back and they don't know how hard
They don't know how hard (They don't know how hard)
They don't know how hard (They don't know how hard)
They don't know how hard it is

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling outside of your window
I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling outside of your window
And I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling
And I feel like crumbling outside of your window
