[Verse]
I, wish I had a little more time
To say the things that's on my mind
We could have done so much more
Before I could say goodbye

[Chorus]
Wish you didn’t have to leave
Now I‘m feeling incomplete
But heaven showed up at your door
Before I could say goodbye

[Post-Chorus]
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye
Before I could say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye
Before I could say goodbye
