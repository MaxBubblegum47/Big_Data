[Chorus: Braeden]
Your way
I'm trying to understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it
Or if I'm wasting my time
Your way, or mine?

[Verse 1: Dylan]
You spend every second with him
You're taking what you're given
Your mother don't approve of the way that you've been living
She says he puts you through it
You shouldn't let him do it
And if there is a voice in your head, don't listen to it

[Verse 2: Braeden]
My mind is open wide
I think of it a thousand times
That empty space left in my bed from when you stayed the night
We were fucked up, but you still made sure I slept on my side
I still wake up wishing you're there when I open my eyes

[Chorus: Braeden]
Your way
I'm trying to understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it, or I'm wasting my time
Your way, or mine?

[Bridge: Dylan & 
Braeden
]
Spend every second with him
You're taking what you're given
Your mother don't approve of the way that you've been living
She says he puts you through it
(My mind is open wide)
You shouldn't let him do it
(I think of it a thousand times)
And if there is a voice in your
(That empty space left in my)
Head don't listen to it

[Chorus: Braeden]
Your way
I'm trying to understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it
Or I'm wasting my time
Your way
Your way
I'm trying to understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it, or I'm wasting my time
Your way

[Outro: Braeden & Dylan]
Your way
I'm trying to understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it
Or I'm wasting my time
Your way, or mine
