[Verse 1]
In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home with a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Verse 2]
Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Outro]
I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbours say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part
