[Intro: Thomas Rhett]
You could call, you could call on me
You could fall, you could fall on me
And if you want to, tell me what you gon' do
You could put it all, put it all on me

[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett & Ava Max, Both]
Speedin', 90 in a 65
Grabbed the keys and didn't tell 'em why
Just hit the road
When you need me, relaxin', gettin' in my way
I'm flyin' down the interstate
Just know, just know

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Ava Max]
When you can't pull through, when life's hard on you
Know it ain't no thing, know it ain't no thing
You know what to do

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Thomas Rhett]
You could call, you could call on me (On me)
You could fall, you could fall on me (On me)
And if you want to, tell me what you gon' do
You could put it all, put it all on me
You can count on me, one, two, three
Make it easy for you, A, B, C
And if you want to, tell me what you gon' do
You could put it all, put it all on me

[Verse 2: Kane Brown]
I walk in (Yeah, you did)
Help you get up off that floor (Come on)
You ain't gotta be alone no more (No more)
Just know, just know

[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown & Ava Max]
When you can't pull through, when life's hard on you (So hard)
Know it ain't no thing, know it ain't no thing
You know what to do

[Chorus: All, Kane Brown]
You could call, you could call on me (On me)
You could fall, you could fall on me (On me)
And if you want to, tell me what you  gon' do
You could put it all, put it all on me (Come on)
You could count on me, one, two, three
Make it easy for you, A, B, C
And if you want to, tell me what you gon' do
You could put it all, put it all on me

[Post-Chorus: All, Thomas Rhett]
Yeah, put it all, put it all on me
Yeah, put it all, put it all on me
And if you want to, tell me what you gon' do
You could put it all, put it all on me

[Bridge: Ava Max & Kane Brown]
'Cause when you can't pull through
When life's hard on you (On you)
You can trust me, baby, yeah
Put it all on me

[Chorus: All, Thomas Rhett & Kane Brown]
You could call, you could call on me (On me)
You could fall, you could fall on me (You can fall on me)
And if you want to, tell me what you gon' do
You could put it all, put it all on me (You could put it all on me)
You could count on me, one, two, three (One, two, three)
Make it easy for you, A, B, C (Ayy)
And if you want to, tell me what you gon' do
You could put it all, put it all on me

[Post-Chorus: All, Kane Brown & Ava Max]
Yeah, put it all, put it all on me (Put it on me, baby)
Yeah, put it all, put it all on me (Woo)
And if you want to, tell me what you're gonna do, yeah
And put it on me
