[Verse 1]
Oh, no
I took the wrong way out
Oh, no
I should have known that, baby
Oh, no
Yeah, I've been driving all night
Oh, no
Oh, I just miss my fucking snow white

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh, no, oh oh eh eh
Girl tonight we gonna let it go
Tonight we gonna take it on the floor
Oh oh oh, no, oh oh eh eh
Oh, tonight we're going to break the walls
Tonight we're going to say

[Chorus]
Baby if you fucking want it
You never fucking own it
Oh, I'm not playing any games
Any games tonight
So if you fucking want me
Don't fucking leave me
And let me go alone tonight
Go alone tonight
Baby, if you fucking want it
You never fucking own it
Oh, I'm not playing any games
Any games tonight
So if you fucking want me
Don't fucking leave me
And let me go alone tonight
Go alone tonight

[Break]
Go alone tonight, go alone tonight
Go alone tonight, go alone tonight

[Verse 2]
Oh, no
My girl is gone by now
Oh, no
I should have known that, baby
Come home
Stay for one more night
Don't go
Oh, let me see your fucking moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh, no, oh oh eh eh
Girl tonight we gonna let it go
Tonight we gonna take it on the floor
Oh oh oh, no, oh oh eh eh
Oh tonight we're going to break the walls
Tonight we're going to say

[Chorus]
Baby if you fucking want it
You never fucking own it
Oh, I'm not playing any games
Any games tonight
So if you fucking want me
Don't fucking leave me
And let me go alone tonight
Go alone tonight
Baby, if you fucking want it
You never fucking own it
Oh, I'm not playing any games
Any games tonight
So if you fucking want me
Don't fucking leave me
And let me go alone tonight
Go alone tonight

[Outro]
Go alone tonight, go alone tonight
Go alone tonight, go alone tonight
Go alone tonight, go alone tonight
Go alone tonight, go alone tonight
