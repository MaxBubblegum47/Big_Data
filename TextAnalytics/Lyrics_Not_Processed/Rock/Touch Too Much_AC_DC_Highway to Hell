[Verse 1]
It was one of those nights
When you turn off the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do

[Pre-Chorus]
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

[Chorus]
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch too much

[Verse 2]
She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Like a thunder and lightning storm

[Pre-Chorus]
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

[Chorus]
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch too much

Touch me!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Seems like a touch (touch too much)
You know it's much too much, (much too much)
I really want to feel, yeah (touch too much)
Girl, you know you're giving me (much too much)
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
Cause you're much too much, too much, too much

[Chorus]
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Givin' me a touch, a touch too much
Lay me down and touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
Touch
Come on, touch me
Yeah
