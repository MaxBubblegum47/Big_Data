[Verse 1]
I stumble in, half-past three
And what have you, you done to me
I pass right out, yeah, on the floor
I wake up in the morning and the clock says four
Every night is on repeat, I walk this line with careful feet
I've done too much and I've overdosed
I went too high and I've gone too close

[Pre-Chorus]
Heads or tails, up or down
You know I know, it doesn't matter now
'Cause all I knew is nothing's left
Except I've gotta get this weight off my chest
I'm caught up in the wave
It's you, not me to save
There is no other way to say
How I'm feeling now
You left me in the tide
And now I've realized
That you picked your side
And I

[Chorus]
I'm drifting further now
Drifting further now
I'm drifting further now
I'm drifting further now
Drifting further now
Drifting further now
I'm drifting further now
I'm drifting further now, now, now, now

[Verse 2]
Take your shot and do your worst
This empty heart can't be traversed
I'll drain your love, yeah every drop
I know it's wrong, but I can't stop
And now you see me, now you don't
You're deep in feelings, I'm afloat
Say you need me, oh I'm sure
Turned away, I'm out the door
â€˜Cause I know that you know
That we know I don't know if I can stop

[Pre-Chorus]
And heads or tails, up or down
You know I know, it doesn't matter now
'Cause all I knew is nothing's left
Except I've gotta get this weight off my chest
I'm caught up in the wave
It's you, not me, to save
There is no other way to say
How I'm feeling now
You left me in the tide
And now I've realized
That you picked your side
And I

[Chorus]
I'm drifting further now
Drifting further now
I'm drifting further now
I'm drifting further now
Drifting further now
Drifting further now
I'm drifting further now
I'm drifting further now, now, now, now
