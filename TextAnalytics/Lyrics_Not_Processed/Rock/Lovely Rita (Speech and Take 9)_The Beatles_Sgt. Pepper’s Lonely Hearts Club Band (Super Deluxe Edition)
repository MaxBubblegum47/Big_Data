[Speech]
John: My guitar still seems to go in and out like it's--like the lead's wrong
John: I did a freak out one then, one of them where you don't know what you're doing, just a funny [?]
Paul: Keep that one
John: Alright, let's go
Paul: One, two, three, four
Paul: Et laudate, cum una voce reclamamus, non nobis solum sed toti mundo nati

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me?

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Rita!

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Lovely meter maid
Rita, meter maid
Oh Lovely Rita meter, meter maid

John: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I refuse to go
