[Intro]
Aah!

[Verse 1]
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead

[Pre-Chorus 3]
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Outro]
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright!
