[Chorus 1]
How do you do what you do to me?
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you

[Verse]
How do you do what you do to me?
I'm feeling blue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven't a clue

[Chorus 2]
You give me a feeling in my heart (ooh-la-la)
Like an arrow piercing through it
I suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it?

[Chorus 1]
How do you do what you do to me?
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you

[Chorus 2]
You give me a feeling in my heart, ooh-la-la
Like an arrow piercing through it
I suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it?

[Chorus 1]
How do you do what you do to me?
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you
How do you do what you do to me?
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you
