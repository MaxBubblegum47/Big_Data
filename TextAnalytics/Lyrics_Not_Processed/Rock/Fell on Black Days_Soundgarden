[Verse 1]
Whatsoever I feared has come to light
And whatsoever I've fought off became my life
Just when every day seemed to greet me with a smile
Sunspots have faded, now I'm doin' time, now I'm doin' time

[Chorus]
'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

[Verse 2]
Whomsoever I've cured, I've sickened now
And whomsoever I've cradled, I've put you down
I'm a searchlight soul, they say, but I can't see it in the night
I'm only faking, when I get it right, when I get it right

[Chorus]
'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

[Bridge 1]
How would I know
That this could be my fate?
How would I know
That this could be my fate?

[Verse 3]
'Til what you wanted to see good has made you blind
And what you wanted to be yours has made it mine
So, don't you lock up somethin' that you wanted to see fly
Hands are for shaking, no, not tying, no, not tying

[Bridge 2]
I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change
Sure don't mind... sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change

[Chorus]
'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

[Bridge 1]
How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?

[Outro]
I sure don't mind a change
