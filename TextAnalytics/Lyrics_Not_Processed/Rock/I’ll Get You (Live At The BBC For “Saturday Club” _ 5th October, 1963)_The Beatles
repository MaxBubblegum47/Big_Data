[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

[Chorus]
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you, I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue

[Chorus]
So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Well, there's gonna be a time
When I'm gonna change your mind (When I'm gonna make you mine)
So you might as well resign yourself to me, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

[Chorus]
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Woah yeah
