[Verse 1]
Where do lovers go when they wanna meet
Can I win you over with one glance at me
Why fool with words that nobody will read
And I know and I know and I know and I know
It's getting harder
It's getting harder
It's getting harder
It's getting harder

[Chorus]
It's too much
How can I resist your touch
Finding you was hard enough
I don't care if it's true love
It's too much
It's too

[Verse 2]
When I hit reply, Got me wondering
Are those really your eyes looking back at me
Should I take a chance, When there's no guarantee
And I know and I know and I know and I know
It's getting harder
It's getting harder
It's getting harder
It's getting harder

[Chorus]
It's too much
How can I resist your touch
Finding you was hard enough
I don't care if it's true love
It's too much
It's too much
You can call it what you want
Finding you was hard enough
I don't care if it's true love
It's too much

[Bridge]
Why does it feel so wrong
When I know that we both had fun
Gotta act when I feel that drive
Before it eats me alive

[Chorus]
It's too much
How can I resist your touch
Finding you was hard enough
I don't care if it's true love
It's too much
It's too much
You can call it what you want
Finding you was hard enough
I don't care if it's true love
It's too much
Too much
Too much
