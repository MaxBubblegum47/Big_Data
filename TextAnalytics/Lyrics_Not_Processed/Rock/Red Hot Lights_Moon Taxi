[Verse 1]
I give you everything I can
We're gonna need it (we're gonna need it)
And when I think of where we've been
I can't believe it (I can't believe it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I didn't know back then
No one's an island
Here we stand, hand in hand
Rising up again

[Chorus]
But you've got the fight in your eyes
And now we're shining under red hot lights
The truth burns as bright as the sun
We're gonna come back and show everyone

[Verse 2]
We'll watch the world look back at you
What is it seeing? (what is it seeing?)
But we did what we had to do
To keep believing (to keep believing)

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we didn't know back then
No one's an island
Here we stand, hand in hand
Rising up again

[Chorus]
But you've got the fight in your eyes
And now we're shining under red hot lights
The truth burns as bright as the sun
We're gonna come back and show everyone

[Bridge]
We'll show everyone
We'll show everyone
We'll show everyone
Now they can't keep
Holding us down
But we can beat them
Back to the ground
Now I can see it
Standing around
Now I can see
Now I can see cause

[Chorus]
You've got the fight in your eyes
And now we're shining under red hot lights
The truth burns as bright as the sun
We're gonna come back and show everyone

[Outro]
We'll show everyone
We'll show everyone
