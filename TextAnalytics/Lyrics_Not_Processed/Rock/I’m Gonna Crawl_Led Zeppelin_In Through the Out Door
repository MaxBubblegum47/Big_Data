[Verse 1]
Oh she's my baby
Let me tell you why
Hey, she drives me crazy
She's the apple of my eye

[Verse 2]
Because she is my girl
And she can never do wrong
If I dream too much at night
Somebody please bring me down

[Verse 3]
Hey, I love that little lady
I got to be her fool
Ain't no other like my baby
I can break the golden rule

[Verse 4]
Cause I get down on my knees
Oh, I pray that love won't die
And if I always try to please
I don't know the reason why, yeah

[Bridge]
If she would come back, only stay with me
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit of my love, I give to you girl
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit, every, every little bit of my love

[Solo]
Hit me!

[Verse 5]
I don't have to go by plane
I ain't gotta go by car
I don't care just where my darling is
People, I just don't care how far

[Verse 6]
I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl, now
I don't care if I got to go back home
I don't care what I got to stand again, babe

[Verse 7]
I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl
Ah, woohoo
I don't wanna go, baby

[Verse 8]
Hey, she give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
My baby give me good loving

[Outro]
Yes I love her
I guess I love her
Yes I love her
I wanna crawl
