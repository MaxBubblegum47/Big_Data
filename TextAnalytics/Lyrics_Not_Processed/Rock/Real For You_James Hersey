[Verse 1]
I don't know what you came from
Don't know what you left behind
So don't be afraid 'cause
I'm not gonna use it against you now
I know what you came for
'Cause I know what you like
But it don't make sense how
You could be so

[Pre-Chorus]
You say it's the same to you
But I can't shake the feeling off my mind
That you want more, you want more
Something in the way you look
Away like you don't need me at your side
But you want more, you want more

[Chorus]
Real for you
I can't help it, I get real for you
I feel for you
When I get real for you
I can't help it, I get real for you
I feel for you
When I get you, you
Real for you
I feel for you
When I get you, you
Real for you
I feel for you

[Verse 2]
I don't know what you're running from
Don't care what the past may hide
So don't push away 'cause I'm not gonna let you fight me
I know what you need now
'Cause I know what you like
If you just come over
We could get

[Pre-Chorus]
You say it's the same to you
But I can't shake the feeling off my mind
That you want more, you want more
Something in the way you look
Away like you don't need me at your side
But you want more, you want more

[Chorus]
Real for you
I can't help it, I get real for you
I feel for you
When I get real for you
I can't help it, I get real for you
I feel for you
When I get you, you
Real for you
I feel for you
When I get you, you
Real for you
I feel for you
