First sight of rays of light I hear the birds sing
It's a sign he's giving me, everything will be okay
Sometimes when I wake up, and I'm wondering
How my life would have been if I didn't sing
I get a little stressed out, every now and then
But problems come and problems go when I'm around him
Blessed in the morning
Blessed in the evening
And again I realize the reason why I sing

First sight of rays of light I hear the birds sing

But problems come and problems go when I'm around him
Blessed in the morning
Blessed in the evening
And again I realize the reason why I sing

Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
I need you
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
Oh yeah
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
Every time
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
Oh hey
I'm blessed… Oh hey
I'm blessed… I'm blessed
I'm blessed… So blessed
I'm blessed… So blessed
