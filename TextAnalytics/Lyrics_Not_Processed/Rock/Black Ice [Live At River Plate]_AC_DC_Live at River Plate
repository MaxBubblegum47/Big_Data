[instrument break]

[Verse 1]
Well the devil may care
You toss them back and be a man
With the last time
Black ice
End of it all, end of the line
End of the road
Black ice
Black ice

[Verse 2]
Come on and bleeding out the crowds
We are watching all the women go
Many a mile I will never take
I run for forty miles and come up running late
Don’t you know I live it down
When the devil come a calling I am not going to be around
Black ice
Black ice
Black ice
The devil come a calling I am not going to be around
Black ice

[Verse 3]
Living long, living long
Shoot for the moon, you're gonna take it all
And I am going to rip it out
I'll kick, I'll creep-crawl down your street
I'll gouge your eyes out
Black ice
Black ice
Black ice
Black ice

[Verse 4]
My life
Black ice
My life
Black ice
My life
When the devil come a-calling
I ain't going to be around
I'll kick, I creep crawl down your street and gouge your eyes out
Black ice
