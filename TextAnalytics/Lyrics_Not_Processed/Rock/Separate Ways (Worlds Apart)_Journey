[Verse 1]
Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you
Feeling that it's gone, can't change your mind
If we can't go on to survive the tide, love divides

[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you, one night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

[Verse 2]
Troubled times
Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain â€“ distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain
If you must go, I wish you love
You'll never walk alone, take care, my love
Miss you, love

[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you, one night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

[Chorus]
Oh, someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you, one night will remind you
If he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you
You know I still love you

[Outro]
I still love you, girl, I really love you, girl
And if he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you
No, no!
