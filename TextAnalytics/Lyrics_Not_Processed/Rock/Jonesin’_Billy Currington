[Verse 1]
This porch light
I can keep it on all night
I can stay up til the birds fly
But every minute's like a year
I got it bad
It ain't going away
I've gotta have it
I don't mean to sound dramatic
But I'm going crazy over here

[Chorus]
I want ya, need ya
Wanna lose it with ya
Tired of sitting
Lookin' at your picture
Should be right here with ya
Instead of being lonely
Yeah, I've gotta
Get a little bit of you
To get me going
You got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Yeah, you got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'

[Verse 2]
I'm thirsty
And I could start
This night off early
And drink until
The TV's blurry
Cause I got plenty of beer
But that won't fix me
You're the only one that hits me
One shot of you it always kicks me
Into another gear

[Chorus]
You know, I want ya, need ya
Wanna lose it with ya
Tired of sitting
Lookin' at your picture
Should be right here with ya
Instead of being lonely
Yeah, I've gotta
Get a little bit of you
To get me going
You got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Yeah, you got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Yeah, you got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Hey, hey, alright
Oh, oh, ooo, woo

[Bridge]
Wherever you are
Girl it's too damn far
Cause if you ain't in my arms
Oh, you know I'm Jonesin'

[Chorus]
I want ya, need ya
Wanna lose it with ya
Tired of sitting
Lookin' at your picture
Should be right here with ya
Instead of being lonely
Yeah, I've gotta
Get a little bit of you
To get me going
I want ya, need ya
Wanna lose it with ya
Tired of sitting
Lookin' at your picture
Should be right here with ya
Instead of being lonely
Oh, I've gotta
Get a little bit of you
To get me going
You got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Yeah, you got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Yeah, you got me
Jonesin', Jonesin', Jonesin'
Hey, hey, alright
Oh, oh, ooo, woo
That's right
You got me
Jonesin', Jonesin'
