[Verse 1]
Hey, mister businessman
Head of the company
Are you looking for a lady?
One who likes to please?
Hey, mister businessman
This one likes to tease
With a special service
And the French quantities

[Pre-Chorus]
But she won't sacrifice
What you want, tonight
She won't come across
Unless there's money in her hand
And she's calling all the shots

[Chorus]
She got you by the balls
She got you by the balls
She got you by the balls
She got you by the balls
She got you by the balls

[Verse 2]
Hey, mister businessman
High society
She can play the school girl
And spank you all you please

[Pre-Chorus]
But she won't sacrifice
What you want, tonight
She won't come across
Unless there's money in her hand
She don't go overtime

[Chorus]
Kiss your balls goodbye!

[Solo]

[Bridge]
(Hangin' left, hangin' right)
Got you by the balls
(Got your shorts, got your curlies)
Got you - by the balls

[Chorus] (x2)
