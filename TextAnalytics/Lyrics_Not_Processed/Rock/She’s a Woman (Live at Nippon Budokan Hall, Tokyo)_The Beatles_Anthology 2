[Verse 1]
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

[Verse 2]
She don't give the boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as
Loving, don't ask me why

[Bridge]
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

[Verse 1]
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

[Verse 1]
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

[Outro]
She's a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman
