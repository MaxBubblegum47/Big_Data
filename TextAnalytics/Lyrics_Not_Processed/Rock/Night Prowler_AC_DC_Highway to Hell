[Verse 1]
Somewhere a clock strikes midnight
And there's a full moon in the sky
You hear a dog bark in the distance
You hear someone's baby cry
A rat runs down the alley
And a chill runs down your spine
And someone walks across your grave
And you wish the sun would shine
'Cause no one's going to warn you
And no one's going to yell, "Attack!"
And you don't feel the steel
Till it's hanging out your back

[Chorus]
I'm your night prowler (I sleep in the day)
I'm your night prowler (get out of my way)
Yeah, I'm the night prowler (watch you tonight)
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

[Verse 2]
Too scared to turn your light out
'Cause there's something on your mind
Was that a noise outside the window?
What's that shadow on the blind?
As you lie there naked
Like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation
As I slip into your room

[Chorus]
I'm your night prowler (I sleep in the day)
I'm your night prowler (get out of my way)
Yeah, I'm the night prowler (watch you tonight)
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

[Chorus]
I'm your night prowler (I sleep in the day)
I'm your night prowler (get out of my way)
Yeah, I'm the night prowler (watch you tonight)
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

[Chorus]
I'm your night prowler (I sleep in the day)
I'm your night prowler (get out of my way)
Yeah, I'm the night prowler (watch you tonight)
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

[Outro]
I'm your night prowler (break down your door)
I'm your night prowler (crawlin' 'cross your floor)
I'm the night prowler (make a mess of you) Yes, I will
Night prowler
And I'm tellin' this to you
There ain't nothin', there ain't nothin'
Nothin' you can do

"Shazbot, nanu nanu"
