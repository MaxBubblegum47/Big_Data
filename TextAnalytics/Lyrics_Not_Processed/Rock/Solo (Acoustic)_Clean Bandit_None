[Verse 1: Demi Lovato & Kamille]
I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you (it's solo, solo, everybody)
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool (it's solo, solo, everybody)

[Pre-Chorus]
Since you been gone
I've been dancing on my own
This boy's up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby, you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more

[Chorus]
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

[Post-Chorus]
I do it solo

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato & Kamille]
Every single night I lose it
I can't even hear the music without you
(It's solo, solo, everybody)
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Try to stop myself from calling
But I really wanna know if you're with someone new
(It solo, solo, everybody)

[Pre-Chorus]
Since you've been gone
I've been dancing on my own
This boy's up in my zone
But they can't turn me on (can't turn me on)
'Cause baby, you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more

[Chorus]
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch but I got nobody
So I do it solo

[Post-Chorus]
I do it solo
I do it solo

[Bridge]
Can't do it solo

[Chorus]
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

[Post-Chorus]
I do it solo
I do it solo

[Outro]
So I do it solo
