[Intro]
Perignon
Gotti!

[Bridge: Big Sean]
What up to the hood, niggas got love for me
All my bad bitches, man they got love for me
One time for the squad cause they got love for me
Get the fuck up out my face if it's not love for me
Lil Bitch, lil nigga
Lil Bitch, lil nigga

[Hook: Big Sean + (Yo Gotti)]
Man I done came a long way
I done came a long, long, long way
Top floor, lookin down, that shit a long way
I done came a long, long, long way
A long, long, long, long, long, long way
All my hoes fuck with me the long way
Made it to the top, made it to the top
Hell yeah, we done took the long way
The long, long, long
(Long, long, long way)
Imma get it the right or the wrong way
(Wrong way, hell yea we done came a long way)
Hell yea, we done came a long, long, long way
Lil bitch, lil nigga
Lil bitch, lil nigga

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
What up to the hood, niggas got love for me
Free Bobby Schmurda, tell him fuck the judge for me
Gotti Montana, nigga
All I havin' is my balls and my words, so salute the plug for me
All the hustle been a long time
I used to freestyle in the lunch line
Now three bricks for a punchline
So I ain't freestyled in a long time
Long, long, long, long, long, long way
Fast money always come the wrong way
Guess I'mma live the wrong way
I'm head first on a one way
Million dollars dreams been formulated
Took my dogs out the trap, now they all incorporated
Niggas waitin' on that new shit, they've been long awaited
If my life was a movie, fuckin' Scarface it
Lights, camera, action, shooters with me all day
I can't even let my bitch fuck with me the long way
Gotta feed the streets, I never leave 'em hungry
Shoutout to the streets cause they fuck with me the long way
Long, long, long way

[Hook: Big Sean + (Yo Gotti)]
Man I done came a long way
I done came a long, long, long way
Tile floor, lookin' down, that shit a long way
I done came a long, long, long way
A long, long, long, long, long, long way
All my hoes fuck with me the long way
Made it to the top, made it to the top
Hell yeah, we done took the long way
The long, long, long
(Long, long, long way)
I'mma get at the writer the wrong way
(Wrong way, hell yea we done came a long way)
Hell yea, we done came a long, long, long way
Lil bitch, lil nigga
Lil bitch, lil nigga

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Fuck with me the long way
Bitch treat me, I'mma leave her with the long face
Born good with the bad like Coldplay
Legend in the hood, boy I coulda caught a gold case
Money so long, it don't fold up
Bad weather in the hood, I got it snowed up
Bad bitches in my section, I tell 'em hold up
If you ain't real, shawty gotta get the fuck up
Can't tell me nothin' holmes
I come from project homes
Money got hella long
And I put my whole project on
Thousand dollars just for one shoe
Killin' haters when I come through
I done been broke, got rich
Went broke, stayed rich
That's what real niggas go through
And I done came a long way
I done came a long, long, long way
Back in the day I had ratchets
Now I only fuck with Beyonces

[Hook: Big Sean + (Yo Gotti)]
Man I done came a long way
I done came a long, long, long way
Tile floor, lookin' down, that shit a long way
I done came a long, long, long way
A long, long, long, long, long, long way
All my hoes fuck with me the long way
Made it to the top, made it to the top
Hell yeah, we done took the long way
The long, long, long
(Long, long, long way)
I'mma get at the writer the wrong way
(Wrong way, hell yea we done came a long way)
Hell yea, we done came a long, long, long way
Lil bitch, lil nigga
Lil bitch, lil nigga

[Bridge: Big Sean]
What up to the hood, niggas got love for me
All my bad bitches, man they got love for me
One time for the squad cause they got love for me
Get the fuck up out my face if it's not love for me
Lil Bitch, lil nigga
Lil Bitch, lil nigga
