[Verse 1]
Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go away and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire

[Verse 2]
Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
And can he do to you the things that I do?
Oh no, I can take you higher

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull
At night, I wake up with the sheets soakin' wet
And a freight train runnin' through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
