[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Yeah, go sit out
Cold soul through, black know 'em, don't got no tools for now
They both sit out
A-T-L, we grab him 'fore the dawgs come out, bouncin' out
What am I supposed to do when we feel down and out?
Wonderful, hate that a bitch stare'll make me feel so magical, like
You would sit back, hit that three now, got a three and O
Got four and then my Deage come out, weavin' out
Nothing really ever come easy now
Grind it down 'til the world feel unbelievable
Leave you now, I can't even—now, now, now, now

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Yeah, that's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
And that's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
First couple racks, just spend it on some new Chanel (Ayy)
Caught a whiff and now, ooh, got that new smell
Pushing in that G-Wagen, I wonder how that coupe feel
How is you feel? Uh, grinding too, still

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Yeah, that's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside (Downside) of keeping it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playing pretend
I'm not shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside

[Outro: Ryan Beatty]
That's the downside
That's the downside
Shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm workin' too hard
