Late yesterday night
I saw a light shine from a window
And as I looked again
Your face came into sight
I couldn't walk on
Until you'd gone from your window
I had to make you mine
I knew you were the one
Oh, I would be glad
Just to have a love like that
Oh, I would be true
And I'd live my life for you
So meet me tonight
Just where the light shines from our window
And as I take your hand
Say that you'll be mine tonight
Oh, I would be so glad
Just to have a love like that
Oh, I would be true
And I'd give my life for you
So meet me tonight
Just where the light shines from our window
And as I take your hand
Say that you'll be mine tonight
