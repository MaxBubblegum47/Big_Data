[Intro]
There's still a long way to go
And the nights are closing in
But if I'd travelled any faster babe
Lord knows where I might have been

[Verse 1]
Right from those early days
I put my faith in the axle not the wheels
Like old Zeno's toytus
With Achilles snapping at my heels

[Chorus]
Don't worry
There's no hurry
Here we are
With all the time in the world

[Verse 2]
I could have been a high-flying dealer
But I have no desire for speed
I could have been a wild receiver
But I've got everything I need
And so I watch the world
Go racing by tearing up the street
I lay back in the long grass
Take it easy and rest my feet

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
No-one ever held me back
You know that no-one ever put me in chains
No-one ever saw me racing ahead
No-one had to tug on my reins
As everybody knows
I may be slow but I never quit
Sometimes on a good day I sit and think
Sometimes I just sit

[Chorus]
