[Verse 1]
Not guilty
Of getting in your way while you're trying to steal the day
Not guilty
And I'm not here for the rest, I'm not trying to steal your vest
I am not trying to be smart, I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your aging head, but like you heard me said
Not guilty

[Verse 2]
Not guilty
Of being on your street, getting underneath your feet
Not guilty
No use handing me a writ while I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your heart, I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed, but like you heard me said
Not guilty

[Verse 3]
Not guilty
For looking like a freak, making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray on the road to Mandalay
I won't upset the apple cart, I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been mislead, but like you heard me said, I'm not guilty

[Outro]
Not guilty
Not guilty
Not guilty
Not guilty
