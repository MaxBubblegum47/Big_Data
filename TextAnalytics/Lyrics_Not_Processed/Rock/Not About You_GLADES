[Intro]
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
It's not about you

[Verse 1]
We could have something real nice
But you're lost in your own vibe, yeah
Never far away from your phone
Calling back ain't that hard you know?
Oh, you're making me think twice
Everyone's got their own vice, yeah
But you're so damn full of yourself
Not gonna be a book on your shelf

[Pre-Chorus]
Wow, you really don’t know how to quit
Can you tell that you’re a little shh?

[Chorus]
Why's it always gotta go your way?
Always the kind to play dirty
Even when you're praying on Sunday
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
It’s not about you
And lately
Why you been acting so shady?
Even when you're praying on Sunday
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
It's not about you, no

[Post-Chorus]
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
It's not about you

[Verse 2]
Oh, you used to be on my side
Then you let it get to your mind, yeah
Now you brag 'bout your house in the hills
Shame your personality kills

[Pre-Chorus]
Wow, you really don’t know how to quit
Can you tell that you’re a little shh?

[Chorus]
Why's it always gotta go your way?
Always the kind to play dirty
Even when you're praying on Sunday
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
It’s not about you
And lately
Why you been acting so shady?
Even when you're praying on Sunday
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
It's not about you, no

[Post-Chorus]
You always find a way to make it 'bout you

[Chorus]
Why's it always gotta go your way?
Always the kind to play dirty
Even when you're praying on Sunday
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
It’s not about you
And lately
Why you been acting so shady?
Even when you're praying on Sunday
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
Why's it always gotta go your way?
Always the kind to play dirty
Even when you're praying on Sunday
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
It’s not about you
And lately
Why you been acting so shady?
Even when you're praying on Sunday
You always find a way to make it 'bout you

[Post-Chorus]
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
It's not about you, no
You always find a way to make it 'bout you
It's not about you, no
