[Verse 1]
I don't know why but my hands are shaking
I can see you coming and I stand here waiting
Yeah I get tongue-tied in the conversation
It's an f'd up F6 situation

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to tie my heart down
Board up all the windows
Oh but it's too late now
I let you get too close

[Bridge 1]
I know I should take cover
Hide inside these four walls
But baby I surrender it all

[Chorus]
Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste your danger
But I don't want to run
So hold me to the ground
And I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker
But baby you're a force of nature
Baby you're a force of nature

[Verse 2]
I feel your lips movin' and they take me under
You know just what to do, how to make me want ya
And I know I'll be broken when it's over
Oh, but I can't help but pull ya closer

[Chorus]
Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste your danger
But I don't want to run
So hold me to the ground
And I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker
But baby you're a force of nature
Baby you're a force of nature

Oh Oh Oh

[Bridge 2]
I'll be here 'til we collide
I don't care if I survive
So crash into me one more time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

[Chorus]
Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste your danger
But I don't want to run
So hold me to the ground
And I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker
But baby you're a force of nature
Baby you're a force of nature

[Outro]
Oh
Baby you're a force of nature
Oh
Baby you're a force of nature
Oh
Baby you're a force of nature
Oh
Baby you're a force of nature
