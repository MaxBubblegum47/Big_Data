[Verse 1]
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

[Verse 2]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you (Wooo!)
Don't ever leave me alone

[Bridge]
When you told me, you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me, that you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died

[Verse 3]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
(Believe me, darling!)

[Bridge]
When you told me (Woo!) you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died

[Verse 4]
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
(Oh! Believe me, darling)
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
