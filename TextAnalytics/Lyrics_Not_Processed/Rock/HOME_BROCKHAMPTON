[Verse 1: bearface]
Oh, try to keep your cool
You got a grip, baby
But you just can't seem to fall
You know what we are
Took for granted, fell, we catch ourselves
Don't worry, baby girl
There's no one in the world
But when you say I got a girl
Say it and I know it's killin' you, yeah
When I say you make my knees so weak
Then you know I'm missin' you

[Chorus: bearface]
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl

[Bridge: bearface]
Send me to California
I'm tryna get so lost
Not turnin' up to a 9 to 5
Just wanna know why

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
No plate on a white Lexus
I blacked out on a random cliff
Summer nights, I saw things change
And you still not right to my tick
Pleasure, something
Deep inside my chest
Long nights, long drives
Change across my face
Cowboy, ride it
That's my wild west
Come on babe, you can put it on us
Come on babe, you can put it on me

[Chorus: bearface]
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
