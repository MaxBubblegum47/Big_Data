[Paul] Okay, alright, you win
I'm  in love with you
Okay,  you win
I'm in love with you
Well alright, okay
Okay 
You  never give me your money
Walnetto sandwich
You  never give me your coffee
Okay, come on lads, here it is, boys, here it is, come on, boys
Leslie off, please

It's exactly half-past-2, and it's 36
And  here we go!

[Steve Vaughan] 36

[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any job, I got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

[Verse 4]
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
