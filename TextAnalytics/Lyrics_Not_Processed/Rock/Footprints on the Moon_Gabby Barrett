[Verse 1]
It's Everest, I know
It's impossible, you're too young or too old
That's what they tell you, mmm
So that's what you tell you too
So the light, it fades
When you figure out the rules, they change
When you touch it in your hands, it's sand
Slipping through, but the truth is

[Chorus]
Everybody says that you can't 'til you do (Hey)
Standing there, staring at the mirror in the room (Hey)
Tell yourself, "One more day" (Hey)
"One more day, one more shot" (Hang on)
The voices in the night, in your head (Hey)
Yeah, they'll pay you to quit
He'll tell you that it's hard, 'cause it is (Hey)
But you can do anything (Hey)
Anything you want to
There's footprints on the moon (Hey)

[Verse 2]
Your knees, they'll shake
You're gonna wanna stay home, don't stay
The more your heart wants it, mmm
The harder it'll break, yeah

[Chorus]
Everybody says that you can't 'til you do (Hey)
Standing there, staring at the mirror in the room (Hey)
Tell yourself, "One more day" (Hey)
"One more day, one more shot" (Hang on)
The voices in the night, in your head (Hey)
Yeah, they'll pay you to quit
He'll tell you that it's hard, 'cause it is (Hey)
But you can do anything (Hey)
Anything you want to
There's footprints on the moon (Hey)
There's footprints on the moon (Hey)

[Bridge]
Some days, you're gonna win
Some days, you're gonna be this close
Some days, you'll wanna give up
But hang on

[Chorus]
Everybody says that you can't 'til you do (Hey)
Standing there, staring at the mirror in the room (Hey)
Tell yourself, "One more day" (Hey)
"One more day, one more shot"
The voices in the night, in your head (Hey)
Yeah, they'll pay you to quit
He'll tell you that it's hard, 'cause it is (Hey)
But you can do anything (Hey)
Anything you want to
There's footprints on the moon (Hey)
There's footprints on the moon (Hey)
