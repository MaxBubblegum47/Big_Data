[Verse 1]
I was in my bedroom at midnight when I first heard Nirvana
I was 16 the first time I told a girl I loved her
It was Matagorda Bay when I got my first taste of booze
And where were you? Where were you?
When I was pourin' out my heart for a few dollars in a jar
When I sold a few dreams just to buy a used car
Back when I was still figurin' out what a man's supposed to do
Where were you? Yeah, where were you?

[Chorus]
I wanna know every second of your story
All the highs and the lows, all the grit, all the glory
Who'd you kiss? Who'd you hurt?
What band was on your shirt?
Where were you? Where were you?

[Verse 2]
Was your heart gettin' broke
When someone was bendin' mine?
When I was lookin' for a reason
Were you lookin' for a rhyme?
When I was talkin' to the stars
Were you confessin' to the moon?
I wish I knew, where were you?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wanna know every second of your story
All the highs and the lows, all the grit, all the glory
Who'd you kiss? Who'd you hurt?
What band was on your shirt?
Where were you? Where were you?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I wanna hear about the bottom of your heartbreaks
Your champagne year, was it New York? Was it L.A.?
When you get up when you fell, when you finally found yourself
Where were you? (Where were you?)
Where were you? (Where were you?)
Yeah

[Bridge]
Your last and your first
Your best and your worst
All the twists, all the turns
All the diamonds in the dirt
Yeah, I wanna know, yeah, I wanna know
Who'd you kiss? Who'd you hurt?
What band was on your shirt?

[Outro]
I wanna hear about the bottom of your heartbreaks
Your champagne year, was it New York? Was it L.A.?
When you get up when you fell, when you finally found yourself
Oh, where were you? (Where were you?)
Where were you? (Where were you?)
When you get up when you fell, when you finally found yourself
Where were you?
Where were you?
