[Intro]

[Chorus]
How come twenty four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days?
Oh, twenty four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days, yeah?
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way

[Verse 1]
Sitting, looking at the clock
Oh, time moves so slow
I've been watchin' for the hands to move
Until I just can't look no more

[Chorus]
How come twenty four hours
Baby, sometimes seems to slip into days?
A minute seems like a lifetime
Baby, when I feel this way

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
To sing a song for you
I recall you used to say
"Oh baby this one's for we two"
Which in the end is you anyway

[Chorus]
How come twenty four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days?
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way

[Verse 3]
There was a time that I stood tall
In the eyes of other men
But by my own choice I left you woman
And now I can't get back again

[Chorus]
How come twenty-four hours
Sometimes seem to slip into days?
Well, well, well a minute seems like a lifetime
Baby, when I feel this way
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way
I feel this way
