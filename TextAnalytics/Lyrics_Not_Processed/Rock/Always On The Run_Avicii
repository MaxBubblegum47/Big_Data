[Verse 1]
Take me from the city, let's go for a drive
Take me, Take me anywhere, just make me feel alive
Make me feel this fire, higher than the sun
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

[Chorus]
Always on the run, always on the run
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run
Always on the run, always on the run
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
On the run, on the run, run, run, run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

[Verse 2]
We could save our money, we could buy a house
Hit back on our patio, watching fireflies
We could feel this fire, higher than the sun
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

[Chorus]
Always on the run, always on the run
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run
Always on the run, always on the run
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
On the run, on the run, run, run, run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run
