[Verse 1: Aloe Blacc]
How am I ever gonna get my head screwed back on?
You chewed me up, you spit me out and left me here all alone
You beat me up, broke me down
Pieces of me scattered all around
I'm black and blue
Black and blue

[Verse 2: Mac Davis]
How'd I ever wind up here in this smokey hotel?
Neon blinking through the curtains and I'm hurtin' like hell
I see the streets, I smell the rain
But I don't feel a god damn thing but pain
I'm black and blue
Black and blue

[Verse 3: Aloe Blacc]
I close my eyes and I see you standing there
And I reach for you and you vanish in thin air
Couldn't take time to say goodbye
Ripped out my heart and left me here to die
I'm black and blue
Black and blue

[Verse 4: Aloe Blacc]
So here I am looking down at the cold city lights
Just another pair of eyes in the darkness tonight
You took everything that I had to give
You even took away my will to live
I'm black and blue
Black and blue
