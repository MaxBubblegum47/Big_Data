One day
You'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

Some day
You'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know

Oh one day
You'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

Yet tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know

Oh one day
You'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
