[Verse 1]
Boy if my money was time
I would give you all of mine
'Cause something about you is so far familiar
Just had to tell ya, easy to recognize
Even when I'm alone, stuck in my head like a song
When I think about you it's more than often
Turning and tossing, you keep me up at night

[Chorus]
When I look at you
Can't keep my mind to myself
Your eyes
When I look at you
Can't think of nobody else
Your eyes

[Verse 2]
Right now I'm so irresponsible
You're giving me sensory overload
Something about you is so appealing
You give me feelings, the kind I can't deny
There's nothing more that I can say
My heart wouldn't listen anyway
I do not choose to leave or stay
And that's too much for me to take

[Chorus]
When I look at you
Can't keep my mind to myself
Your eyes
When I look at you
Can't think of nobody else
Your eyes

[Post-Chorus]
Every single time I look at you
Every single time I look at you

[Chorus]
When I look at you
Can't keep my mind to myself
Your eyes
When I look at you
Can't think of nobody else
Your eyes

[Post-Chorus]
Every single time I look at you
Every single time I look at you
