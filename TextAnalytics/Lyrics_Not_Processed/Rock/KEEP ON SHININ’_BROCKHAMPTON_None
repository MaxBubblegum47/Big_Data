[Lyrics from Leak]

[Sample]
Every time we wrote a song, it was a hit
That was unbelievable
That first beat is right on time
Right on top, like they say

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
I don't fuck with no bitch that ain't been hustling
I grew up way quicker than momma knew back then

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I threw up all that liquor, I was supposed to hold it (Hold it)
When I go out to party, I get paranoia (Lonely)
I'ma island out in public, you supposed to hold me (Hold me)
Fuck 'em when I'm at the store 'cause Shelah put me on, bruh
Damn, I miss the days when I didn't have a lawyer
Damn, I miss the days when I didn't have cable
Damn, I miss the days when I didn't have paper
When the nigga I was bugging wasn't hitting me for favor

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Fifty off the top, the double C was on your backside
Switchin' out positions in the car don't want no tickets
Sneaking undercover, hopping fences in your backyard
I was on the floor, sunbathing just like a reptile
I wish I could scoop you out the pool
Remember the first time I pulled a move?
Well damn, I guess I'm off it cut the check for me not office
My brother been bossin' up like steroids was in his coffee
We all be going through it, with crazy ex-lovers
That make me block my number
But damn you know I gotcha, alright

[Interlude]
What was wrong with the world?
(everybody's talking about the good 'ol days)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I'm all out
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I want love
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though

[Verse 3: JOBA]
I suppose the 90210 is where people go when they sell their souls
But you know what? It ain't all bad
But just like dough
The more you make, then the more you throw
You threw it all though, you gave it all up
Damn
You used to wanna run for office
Now you just wanna be poppin' so bad
Yachts and mansions, All That like Kenan Thompson
I know your momma
And I know your momma don't approve of the pussy poppin'
She spent her whole life scraping change to put you through college so you had options
Used to love to dance and sing but you've been fucking actors
Blowin' smoke and stealin' keys
Postin' pics in Bentleys
Blowin' coke and eating free
And you ain't shit on TMZ but you're a star to me

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I can't fuck with no nigga who ain't got no function
I can't trust them no more
I can't fuck with no nigga who ain't got no function
I can't trust you niggas no more
No more

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I want love
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I want love
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though
