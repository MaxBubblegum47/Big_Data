[Verse 1]
Burnin' alive
Set my soul on fire
Running with a gun
This place is gonna burn

[Pre-Chorus]
No fire-water, or Novocain
No thunderstorm, no John Wayne
No kids to rock, nowhere to run
So, watch out, 'cause this place is gonna burn

[Chorus]
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive
Burnin' alive

[Verse 2]
They be smokin' your hide, come runnin' wild
Tell you, "Nothing to fear, 'cause the buck stops here"
He came from a little town called Hope
And someday, maybe, it'll go up in smoke
I said

[Pre-Chorus]
No fire-water, or Novocain
No thunderstorm and no John Wayne
No kids to rock, nowhere to run
So, watch out, 'cause this place is gonna burn

[Chorus]
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
It's an all-out war
An all-out war
Burnin' alive
Burnin' alive

[Bridge]
Somewhere, there's a little town called Hope
And someday, maybe, baby
He'll inhale that smoke
(Ha-ha)

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, we're burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
It's an all-out war
An all-out war
Hear the battle roar
It's an all-out war
Yeah, we're burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive

Yeah
Watch the place burn down
