[Paul McCartney]
Red light

[Engineer]
Demo take one

[Verse 1]
If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast

[Verse 2]
If you want it, any time
I can give it
But you better hurry because it may not last

[Chorus]
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?

[Verse 3]
If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you better hurry because it's going fast

[Verse 1]
If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast

[Verse 2]
If you want it, any time
I can give it
But you better hurry because it may not last

[Chorus]
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?

[Verse 4]
Sonny, if you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fast

Woo, fool and his money

[Outro]
Sonny, if you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fast
