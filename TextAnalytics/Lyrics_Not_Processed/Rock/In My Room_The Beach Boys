[Harp Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a world where I can go
And tell my secrets to

[Hook]
In my room
In my room (In my room)

[Verse 2]
In this world I lock out
All my worries and my fears

[Hook]
In my room
In my room (In my room)

[Bridge]
Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday

[Verse 3]
Now it's dark and I'm alone
But I won't be afraid

[Outro]
In my room
In my room (In my room, in my room)
In my room (In my room, in my room)
