[Intro]
She was, she was
She was all that she said she was
She was all that she said she was

[Verse]
I couldn't want for more but all I want is more
I just want her more and more and more and more and
More
But she's untouchable
And I lay my head down, I lay my head down
And then she's lovable
Who were you with last night?
Who were you with last night?
Were you thinking of me?
And where you thinking of me?
Unforgivable sin, unforgivable sin, unforgivable
You're untouchable
And I lay my head down, I lay my head down

[Outro]
She coming my way, she coming my way
I don't know what to say, she coming my way
She fading away, she fading away
And I lay my head down, I lay my head down
