And I'm all stoned, don't mean to compromise
But baby I'm all alone
Yeah, I stay swollen in my lips
Stung by love is all we know
Addicted to those crazy hips
And vodka that'll hit the floor
Yeah, the way she moves around the world
You could say I should have known
Why you do these things?
Got me fucked up all alone
And staring down this drink
Got me racing to the phone
And nervous while I think
I should probably wait till morning
You got me so alone, lone
Yeah, I'm cool, so sexy, this how we move
I run but you never pass the time
Saying baby don't go
Yeah I'm fast, so sweet, but I gotta last
You give it up when you see me down
This time I won't go
I've been stung, stung
Nowhere to run, run
Your ways are poison, they fill my lungs
I've been stung, stung
Nowhere to run, run
Your ways are poison, they fill my lungs
I thought we met for reasons
Years ago this seemed like fate
But now I know, now I know
You love my ups and downs
So surprised I stayed around
You used me for sure
Came to my senses, it's sounds in my tone
No mutual feelings, they're all on your own
And why you do these things?
Got me fucked up all alone
And staring down this drink
Got me racing to the phone
And nervous while I think
I should probably wait till morning
You got me so alone, lone
(x2)
You stung me, I'm hurting
I feel this for certain
We opened the show strong
Now I'm closing curtains
We used to be stand outs
I'm broken my hands out
You know I always take the fall
But you're to blame here
Yeah, I'm cool, so sexy, this how we move
I run but you never pass the time
Saying baby don't go
Yeah I'm fast, so sweet, but I gotta last
You give it up when you see me down
This time I won't go
I've been stung, stung
Nowhere to run, run
Your ways are poison, they fill my lungs
I've been stung, stung
Nowhere to run, run
Your ways are poison, they fill my lungs
