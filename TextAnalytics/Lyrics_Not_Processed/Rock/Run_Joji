[Verse 1]
I fell for your magic, I tasted your skin
And though this is tragic, at least I found the end
I witnessed your madness, you shed light on my sins
And if we share in this sadness, then where have you been?

[Chorus]
I know you're not in love like you used to be
Guess I’m not the one, like you used to think
So you'll just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I’m not enough, like you used to think
So I'll just run (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
You bathe in your victory
You blew out on my fuse
And if I took on the planet
Will I pay my dues?
Your love was a mystery
Yeah, my love is a fool
And I traveled the country just to get to you

[Chorus]
I know you're not in love like you used to be
Guess I'm not the one, like you used to think
So you'll just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
So I'll just run

[Outro]
And I traveled the country
And I traveled the country just to get to you
I know you’re not in love
I know you’re not in love
I know you're not in love
