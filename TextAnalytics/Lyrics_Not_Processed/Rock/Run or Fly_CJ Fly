[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & Capital STEEZ]
Before you fly you gotta run
Before you run your gotta walk
Before you walk you gotta crawl
Before you crawl you gotta be born
Said I came this far we can't go back
Tell me how you feel, cause I really need to know that

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
As dusk turns to dawn, I keep growing, seeking knowledge
Keep knowing seeing cheese without my teeth showing
Thats right, I'm hot now headed to the top now
I got it on lock down about to hold my whole block down
In Pac town, rolling up a dub, Santa Cruisin'
Enthused with my tunes, got the west showing love
See my name on the bills, and people showing up
To see me, shit is real
Cuz I ain't even old enough to buy lotto tickets
But I guess my motto didn't lie
People don't listen until you're really fly
Top five dead or alive thinking I fit the five
But you gonna think I lied, cuz I ain't ever hid my eyes
The ill minded, free will signin
World domination consignment, I co-sign it
I done reach my goal, but I'm not done being a minor
Underground climbing, they can't dig it, they can't find us

[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & Capital STEEZ]
Before you fly you gotta run

[Verse 2: Dirty Sanchez]
It's the Brooklyn representative, no artificial intelligence
Just thinking, enlightening, ain't even take flight yet
I know you feel me, pull out your camcorders
Halves and ounces just ordered, you see a change, it's just my aura
Over time I became a reflection of brains, cash, mary jane
What did I forget to mention?
Well fat blunts since the age of 15
Y'all smoke toothpicks, I pick the steak out of my teeth
Bon appetit, I'd rather be home sick than home-sick
Plastic cups with rubbetussin to keep me posted like pics
Not Budgin or ballin, and you can't run out of here
Don't blink til you reach the top, uh keep up with stairs, no competition
Y'all? smoke on the regular, my way only high grades
Inhale the indica, exhale the nebula
This cypher secular no sharing when they offer us
Fallin off - that's preposterous
Pick up on your chakras, you on the right trail
Come sip that Ciroc with us, no facade
I talk to myself, word to God
Put your hands together, no applause
Fuck the law, digress and fall, progress evolve, fuck the rest of y'all
I'm Professional, and I'm still Dirty

[Verse 3: CJ Fly]
A couple chips for the meal, that's a lot though
Nothing but crisp dollar bills
The more the merrier, the richer I feel
I'm living ideal, about to throw the tints on my wheels
My homies steal, leave you still with the steel
That when shit get reel
It all started way back in the day
Took the high-way but still wasn't trafficking weight
Said fuck it pass me the J card what we happen to play
Against me, just know you might end up having to pay
Since I'm the champ of the game
Smack down the face or just get smacked in your face
Get out of line or get put back in your place
I know it won't be fun having your back in a brace
So just watch what you happen to say

[Verse 4: Capital STEEZ]
Said I came this far and can't go back
Tell me how you feel cause I really need to know that
I call it astromagentum, I woke up in a dream state
This life may seem great, but it ain't
It ain't the first time I seen gray
With more higrade purple rain for the pain
I said I hate to complain
But lately, all I see is days are the same
The ways that it strays can persuade me to change
But I blame it on the game cause it made me this way
I bet it started when I played Cee-Lo
4 5 6 then out came STEELO
A misfit I've been addicted to the weed smoke
All the youngin ever knew was reload the demos and steam on
Dream on, the plan to put his team on is mapped out
We gotta cross the map now
Caught a power surge and then we blacked out
I ain't tapping out unless it's blunt ashes and clouds
