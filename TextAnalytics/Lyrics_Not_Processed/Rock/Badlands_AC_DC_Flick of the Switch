[Verse 1]
I'm a pistol packing man
With a gun in my hand
Lookin' for a woman that'll understand
I like to roll and I like to ride
I'll stop at nothing, never take me alive

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a man with a fast hand
Loving on a last stand
Outlaw, quick draw
Evil talking bandit man

[Chorus]
In the badlands
In the badlands

[Verse 2]
I got a .45 that'll make you fry
Burn your chassis, Lassie, like the 4th of July
I ride it hard, I ride it high
Make love to you 'till you reach for the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a man with a fast hand
Lovin' on a last stand
Outlaw, quick draw
Evil talking bandit man

[Chorus]
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands

[Bridge]
Well, I'm gonna
Saddle up my six pack
Ain't gonna back track
My shooter loaded
Come on girl, I'm gonna give you a thrill

[Solo]

[Chorus]
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands, looking for a woman
In the badlands, who's bad as me
In the badlands, gonna take her away, yeah
In the badlands
Yeah
