One night I was late, came home from a date
Slipped out of my shoes at the door
Then from the front room, I heard a jump tune
I looked in and here's what I saw
There in the night what a wonderful scene
Mom was dancing with Dad to my record machine
And while they danced, only one thing was wrong
They were trying to waltz to a rock and roll song
One, two and then rock
One, two and then roll
They did the rock and roll waltz
Rock, two, three, roll, two, three
It looked so cute to me
I love the rock and roll waltz
One, two and then rock
One, two and then roll
One, two and then jump
It's good for your soul
It's old but it's new
Let's do the rock and roll waltz
There in the night what a wonderful scene
Mom was dancing with Dad to my record machine
And while they danced, only one thing was wrong
They were trying to waltz to a rock and roll song
One, two and then rock
One, two and then roll
One, two and then jump
It's good for your soul
It's old but it's new
Let's do the rock and roll waltz
Let's do the rock and roll waltz
