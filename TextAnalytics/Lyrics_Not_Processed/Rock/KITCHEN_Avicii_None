[Verse 1:FatDrew]
I remember those days I ain't have no racks
I remember those days I ain't have no stacks
You want respect, go get you a stat
Three dicks on me, your hoe know where one at
I'm double down 'cause I ain't goin' like that (AHH)

[Chorus: BIG GU]
(OO AHAH AH)
My niggas got dirty birds and they shoot with that MAC
Made a check off a voice for my niggas in the trap
These niggas late and they tryna ride my wave
Got me a check, now these hoes wanna get saved
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I'ma go get the money, I don't know about you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, my niggas bang red but I love the blue

[Verse 2:MC Kenna]

[Chorus: BIG GU]
(OO AHAH AH)
My niggas got dirty birds and they shoot with that MAC
Made a check off a voice for my niggas in the trap
These niggas late and they tryna ride my wave
Got me a check, now these hoes wanna get saved
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I'ma go get the money, I don't know about you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, my niggas bang red but I love the blue

[Verse3:FatDrew]
I remember those days I ain't have no racks
I remember those days I ain't have no stacks
You want respect, go get you a stat
Three dicks on me, your hoe know where one at
I'm double down 'cause I ain't goin' like that (AHH)
