[Intro]

[Unintelligible]
Yeah
Oh

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 1]
In the morning want to die
In the evening want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
My mother was of the earth
My father was of the sky
But I am of the universe
And that's the reason why:

[Chorus]
I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 2]
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he eats my bones
I feel so insecure now
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 3]
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Interlude]
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Outro]
Yes I'm lonely
Yes I'm lonely
Yes I'm lonely
Yes I'm lonely
Yes I'm lonely
(Yes I'm lonely)
Yes I'm lonely
