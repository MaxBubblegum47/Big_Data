[Verse 1]
I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains

[Pre-Chorus]
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

[Chorus]
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh

[Verse 2]
Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
Without thinking of you
Learned to talk and say
Whatever I wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

[Chorus]
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh

[Outro]
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh
You and I, there's air in between
