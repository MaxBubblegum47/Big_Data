[Verse 1]
I fell in love with the chemicals
I used to pray for a miracle, but now
I know that it's all over
We used to sit by the waterside
I'd kiss your cheek and say, "You're mine"
But now I know it's over

[Pre-Chorus]
And all these little things, they start to slip away, hmm
And all these little things, they start to fade away
And you said

[Chorus]
"Hold me, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'm scared and lost in the dark
And this feeling surely cannot last"
So I took it away, I took it away
Away from you
Mmm, woah, woah

[Verse 2]
I held your hand but you let it go
And I knew your heart had found a home
And now I know it's over
I flew it out into the sky
Was tryna run from this mountain I couldn't climb
'Cause I knew I'd fall over

[Pre-Chorus]
And all these little things, they start to slip away, hmm
And all these little things, they start to fade away
And you said

[Chorus]
"Hold me, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'm scared and lost in the dark
And this feeling surely cannot last"
So I took it away, I took it away

[Bridge]
We were making plans and breaking dreams
When you were next to me
It's 3AM in the back of a cab
And I am begging on my knees
Don't go, won't you stay?
I can't stand to watch you walk away from me
And you said

[Chorus]
"Hold me, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'm scared and lost in the dark
And this feeling surely cannot last"
So I took it away, I took it away
Away from you
Mmm, woah, woah, oh
