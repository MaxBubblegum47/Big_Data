[Verse 1]
You're workin' in bars, ridin' in cars
Never gonna give it for free
Your apartment with a view, on the finest avenue
Lookin' at your beat on the street
You're always pushin', shovin', satisfied with nothing
You bitch, you must be gettin' old

[Pre-Chorus]
So, stop your love on the road
All your diggin' for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
I wonder

[Chorus]
Honey, what do you do for money?
Honey, what do you do for money?
Oh, where do you get your kicks?

[Verse 2]
You're lovin' on the take and you're always on the make
Squeezin' all the blood outta men
Yeah, we're standin' in a queue
Just to spend the night with you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbin', stabbin', trying get it back in
But girl, you must be gettin' slow

[Pre-Chorus]
So, stop your love on the road
All your diggin' for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
Yes I wonder

[Hook]
Honey, what do you do for money?
Oh, honey, what do you do for money?

[Bridge]
What do you do for money honey?
How do you get your kicks?
What do you do for money honey?
How do you get your licks?
Go!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Honey, what do you do for money?
I said, honey, what do you do for money?
Oh yeah
(Honey) Oh yeah, honey
(What do you do for money?) What you gotta do?
(Honey) Oh yeah, honey
(What do you do for money?)
What you gonna do?
Ah, what you gotta do?
