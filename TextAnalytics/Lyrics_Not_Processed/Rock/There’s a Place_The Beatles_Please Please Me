[Verse 1]
Thereâ€”
There's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

[Bridge]
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

[Verse 3]
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

[Outro]
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place
