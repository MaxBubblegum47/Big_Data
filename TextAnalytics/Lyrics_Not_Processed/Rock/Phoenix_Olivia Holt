[Verse 1]
Why you hanging in the background
Like a painting that's been turned 'round
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Why you humming with the mashup
It's like Aretha singing back up
Come on, come on, come on, come on
You know the words go write the song

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Make it alone
It's your time now
Can you feel it now?

[Chorus]
You got the heart of a phoenix
So let them see you rise, hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Let them know that you mean it
Let them see you rise, hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey

[Verse 2]
You feel it burn when you're knocked down
But let the fire be your crown
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Go and claim your kingdom
Then enslave all your demons
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I know you know where you belong

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't look now
But you're off the ground
Can you feel it now?

[Chorus]
You got the heart of a phoenix
So let them see you rise, hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Let them know that you mean it
Let them see you rise, hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey

[Interlude]
Let's see you show 'em how you get gold
Flying right past the ones who said "no"
Let's give them all one hell of a show
Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey

[Chorus]
You got the heart of a phoenix
So let them see you rise, hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Let them know that you mean it
Let them see you rise, hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey

[Bridge]
You got the heart, you got the heart
You got the heart of a, of a, hey
You got the heart, you got the heart
You got the heart of a, of a, hey
You got the heart, you got the heart
You got the heart of a, of a, hey
You got the heart, you got the heart
You got the heart of a, of a...

[Chorus]
You got the heart of a phoenix
So let them see you rise, hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Let them know that you mean it
Let them see you rise, hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
You got the heart of a phoenix
So let them see you rise, hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
Let them know that you mean it
Let them see you rise, hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey
