[Verse 1]
She walked into the room her hand upon her hip
Said, "Look out boy I'll make your backbone slip"
Straight at me, the devil in her eye
I knew what I was getting but took it by surprise

[Chorus 1]
No fooling
She knocked the stuffing out of me

[Chorus 2]
She's some woman
Hard loving woman
She chewed me up and spat me out
Some woman
She's a hard loving woman
Some woman
She's a hard loving woman

[Verse 2]
Never wear nothing but a smile upon her face
Licking her lips but I had the taste
Her temperature was rising I was coming to the boil
Her fires were burning she was pouring oil

[Chorus 1]
I do not jest she really took me to the cleaners
Some woman
I felt just great when she pulled her 38's

[Chorus 2]
She's some woman
Hard loving woman
She chewed me up and spat me out
Some woman
She's a hard loving woman
Some woman
She's a hard loving woman

[Verse 3]
It started with a smile, it turned into a laugh
It ended with a scream I said, "Enough's enough"
Never heard a word she wouldn't let go
A man's a man and every woman ought to know
And there I was and she was dancing

[Chorus 2]
Some woman
Hard loving woman, here we go again
Some woman
She's a hard loving woman
Some woman
She's a hard loving woman
Some woman
She's a hard loving woman
Some woman
She's a hard, hard, hard loving woman
Some woman
Hard loving woman, here we go again
Some woman
She's a hard loving woman
Some woman
She's a hard loving woman
Some woman
She's a hard loving woman
Some woman
She's a hard, hard, hard loving woman

[Outro]
She, she, she, she
She, she, she, she
She was a, she was a
She was a hard loving woman
