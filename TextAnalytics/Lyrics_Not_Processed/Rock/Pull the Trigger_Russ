[Intro: Russ & Francesca Frame]
Yeah, eh, ah, nothing
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger
Maybe, you should pull the fuckin' trigger

[Hook: Russ]
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot

[Verse 1: Russ]
Yeah, why you believin' the propaganda?
Why everybody sound like they wanna be from Atlanta?
Are you the voice or the echo?
Are you the nail or the hammer?
I be talkin' while chewin' my beats, I don't mind my manners
Choruses that fit the opera, that's why I need phantoms
I got my doubt at gun point, that's why I need ransoms
And I be handsome, that's why I got your girl before the money
Honestly, I thought I'd have 30m's before my twenties
But I'm cool with how it's happenin'
Girl in San Fran. who wants to cross routes with me
Like a young Colin Kaepernick
Treat the money like a lateral, I'm passin' it
'Cause my family's number one, never put 'em number two
Tryna buy a house in cash for all the times we had to move
All the times my mom cried 'cause she ain't know what else to do
All the times she lost hope 'cause she ain't know what else to lose
All the times I shoot shots 'cause I don't know what else to shoot, man

[Hook: Russ]
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot

[Verse 2: Russ]
I'ma stay winnin', I don't believe in luck
I believe that life's a buffet, better eat it up
I've seen enough to know that I'm really 'bout to blow
Never felt like an employee, always felt like CEO
Even when I stacked shoes, I was never clocked in
Yeah, I always walked out, but I never walked in
That's a tribute to my head-space
And lately my Devils have been Spanish chicks in red lace
Doing Brujeria on me for ten days
More like ten months, but I got out of it
If I fall in love again, it's probably with a Saudi chick
But I keep my head up high and my middle fingers higher, yo

[Hook: Russ]
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot
