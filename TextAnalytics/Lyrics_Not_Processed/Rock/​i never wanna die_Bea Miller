[Verse 1]
Yesterday is over, it's the first day of my life
You look so fuckin' pretty, and I know it's not the wine
You spin me 'round in circles underneath your starry eyes
And now, I feel alright
And now, I feel alright

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so fuckin' special, oh
And I don't wanna let go, oh
'Cause now I think I'm lookin' at you like it's the very first time
You're just so fuckin' special
So I never wanna die, no
I never wanna die

[Verse 2]
Mmm, my words are stumblin', uh
It's like no one understands them
I couldn't write a love song that captures you if I tried
But hey, I feel alright

[Chorus]
'Cause you'rе so fuckin' special, oh
And I don't wanna let go, oh
'Cause now I think I'm lookin' at you likе it's the very first time
You're just so fuckin' special
So I never wanna die, no
I never wanna die, yeah, oh

[Bridge]
Oh woah, I hope
Tonight's the rest of my life
'Cause, oh woah, I know
I'm finally feelin' alive
Oh woah, I hope
Tonight's the rest of my life
'Cause, oh woah, I know

[Chorus]
That you're so fuckin' special, oh
And I don't wanna let go, oh (I don't wanna let go)
'Cause now I think I'm lookin' at you like it's the very first time
You're just so fuckin' special
So I never wanna die, no
I never wanna die, yeah, oh
