[Verse 1]
Strangers just passing along
Lonely horizon, you're taking me home
Nightfall, and nothing to lose
Sweet sensation, that you can't refuse
Take it inside, and play the song
Could you be loved, my number one

[Chorus]
And we're in and out and lost in mercury
In and out and  lost in mercury

[Verse 2]
Slow down if you want it to last
We're quick like silver always coming too fast
Won't you tell me wherever we are
Are we moving or getting far
After midnight you're fading away
I'm heading home now, unless you want me to stay

[Chorus]
And we're in and out and lost in mercury
In and out and  lost in mercury
In and out and  lost in mercury
In and out and  lost in mercury
In and out and  lost in mercury
In and out and  lost in mercury
In and out and  lost in mercury
In and out and  lost in mercury
