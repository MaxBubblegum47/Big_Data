[Paul and John]
It's okay to leave a dog in a hot car

[Verse - John]
I was thinking that I had it good
Beat my wife like I knew I should
Suddenly a spanner jams the cogs
She went and bought the family a dog


[Pre-Chorus - Paul]
I was supposed to take him to the vet
I'll lock him in the car and watch him sweat

[Chorus]
It's ok to leave your dog in a hot car
(As long as you don't look back)
It's ok to leave your dog in a hot car
As long as you leave the window closed
You'll always know
That nothing bad can possibly happen
The doors locked tight
And he's out of sight
So go and leave your dog in the car


[Verse - John]
Today's only 35 degrees
So leave the mutt in the limousine
Roll the windows up so he stays warm
A little sunlight nеver caused no harm


[Pre-Chorus - Paul]
Just make surе there isn't any doubt
The last thing that I need's him getting out

[Chorus]
It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
(As long as you don't look back)
It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
As long as you tell the passers by
He'll be alright
Then nothing bad can possibly happen
Now it's all over
For dear old rover
So go and leave your dog in the car



[Paul - Mr. Willy]
Mr. Willy and his big fat hands
Are gonna slap your mummy's glands
Until the cows come home
And all the girls and boys
Who don't like any noise
Are gonna send the word by phone
Everything's the same
But they don't know who to blame
When their life's a custard pie
And everybody in it's
Gotta get a sharper wit
To see the faces in the sky

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Outro Chorus]
It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
It's Ringo who sang the ahs

It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
And Ringo I shagged your wife

It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
Keep Clapton away from mine

It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
[Ringo] I warn you with peace and love

[Yoko Ono] It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
[George] Please give me my biscuits back

It's okay to leave a car in a hot dog
[Ringo] But two of us don't eat meat
It's okay to leave a dog in YOUR FACE
