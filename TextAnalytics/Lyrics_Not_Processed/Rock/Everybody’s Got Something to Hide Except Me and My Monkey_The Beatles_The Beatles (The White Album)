[Verse 1]
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, it's such a joy, come on, it's such a joy
Come on, let's take it easy, come on let's take it easy

[Chorus]
Take it easy
Take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide
Except for me and my monkey
Woo!

[Verse 2]
The deeper you go, the higher you fly
The higher you fly, the deeper you go
So come on, come on
Come on, it's such a joy, come on, it's such a joy
Come on, let's make it easy, come on, let's take it easy

[Chorus]
Take it easy
Take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide
Except for me and my monkey, yeah
Oh!

[Verse 3]
Your inside is out when your outside is in
Your outside is in when your inside is out
So come on (woo!), come on (woo!)
Come on, it's such a joy, come on, it's such a joy
Come on, let's make it easy, come on, let's make it easy

[Chorus]
Make it easy (woo!)
Make it easy (woo!)
Everybody's got something to hide
Except for me and my monkey
Hey!
Yeah!

[Outro]
Come on, come on, come on, come on
