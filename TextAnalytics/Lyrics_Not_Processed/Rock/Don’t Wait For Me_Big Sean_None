[Lupe Fiasco:]

Alarm clock said i'm too late
And they said i'm too weak I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long and don't look too strong
Well how long would you take?
Waiting's got me here in the first place
Another second, i've been second maybe third in the worst case
Now it's displayed in my wordplays
Moving weight, it's such a trap
Move and wait, you can't do that
I know i'm dope man but I can't move crack
And it's such a fracture when you're thinking 'bout your plans

But I try and bring it back before your brain hit the pan
Sean from Detroit, Lupe from Chicago land
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers designed both of the Sedans
Ride with Mr. right on time, or stay Miss. another chance
Now, redirected at the girls, not an ultimatum just an option in this world
When things come and go, when the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing, a little late for a lot
