[Verse 1: CUT_]
Run and hide
You change your mind
I'm up all night
You got my blessings
Can't decide
What's wrong or right
Hold on tight
It's all I'm asking

[Pre-Chorus: CUT_]
Time ain't easy on us
We will never know
Where we'll end up
I will follow where you go

[Chorus: CUT_]
Didn't watch your step and you fell right in
Feeling like it's you who's been chosen
Only you can feed off your memories
Read it in the lines of the broken

[Drop: CUT_]
Read it in the lines of the broken
Read it in the lines of the broken
Read it in the lines of the broken
Read it in the lines of the broken

[Verse 2: CUT_]
You got on
A different ride
Another side
You got me guessing
Can you turn
Back to the light
Leave it behind
It's all I'm asking

[Pre-Chorus: CUT_]
I keep chasing your shadow
But I will never know
Where we'll end up
I will follow where you go

[Drop: CUT_]
Read it in the lines of the broken
Read it in the lines of the broken

[Chorus: CUT_]
Didn't watch your step and you fell right in
Feeling like it's you who's been chosen
Only you can feed off your memories
Read it in the lines of the broken

[Drop: CUT_]
Read it in the lines of the broken
Read it in the lines of the broken
Read it in the lines of the broken
Read it in the lines of the broken
