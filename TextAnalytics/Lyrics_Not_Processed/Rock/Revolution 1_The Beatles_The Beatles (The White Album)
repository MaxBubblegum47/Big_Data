[Intro: Geoff Emerick & 
John Lennon
]
Take two
Okay

[Verse 1]
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world

[Pre-Chorus]
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out, in

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
Well, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you go carrying pictures
 
of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

[Outro]
All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
