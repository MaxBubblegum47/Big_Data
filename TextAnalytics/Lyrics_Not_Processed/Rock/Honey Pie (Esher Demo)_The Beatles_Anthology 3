[Chorus 1]
Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

[Chorus 2]
Now honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong

[Interlude]
You became a legend of the silver screen
And now you're [gibberish]

[Chorus 2]
Now honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong

[Bridge]

[Instrumental/Scat]

[Interlude]
Will the wind that blew her boat away to sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?

[Chorus 1]
Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

[Outro]

[Scat]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
To be where you belong
