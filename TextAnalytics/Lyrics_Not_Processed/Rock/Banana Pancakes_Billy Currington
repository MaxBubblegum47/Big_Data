[Chorus 1]
Can't you see that it's just raining?
Ain't no need to go outside

[Chorus 2]
But, baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

[Chorus 1]
Can't you see that it's just raining?
Ain't no need to go outside

[Verse 1]
But just maybe, like a ukulele
Momma made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
'cause you're my little lady
Lady, lady, love me
'cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside

[Chorus 1]
Can't you see that it's just raining?
Ain't no need to go outside

[Verse 2]
Ain't no need, ain't no need, mmm, mmm
Can't you see, can't you see?
Rain all day, and I don't mind

But the telephone is singing
Ringing
It's too early
Don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything
We need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
Wake up slow, mmm mm, wake up slow

[Chorus 2]
But, baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song is meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

[Chorus 1]
Can't you see that it's just raining?
Ain't no need to go outside

[Outro]
Ain't no need, ain't no need
Rain all day, and I really, really, really don't mind
Can't you see, can't you see?
You got to wake up slow
