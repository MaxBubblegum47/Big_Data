Go down
Go down

[Verse 1]
I've been enchained
She got shackles on me
That woman to blame
For the hell and misery

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't find my way out of here
Shoot me down in a burning fear
Going down for a stretch of years
Way down low

[Chorus]
I'm deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
I'm down in, down in
Down in the hole
Well I'm deep in, deep in
That woman got me deep in the hole, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm sinking down
She got me down on the floor
Can't touch both walls
The further down I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Pulls the string on my riding bow
Make me sing when she fire my load
Ain't no slave, you do what you're told
You sold your soul

[Chorus]
I'm deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
I'm down in, down in
Down in the hole
Well I'm deep in, deep in
That woman got me deep in the hole
Ow

[Solo]

[Chorus][x2]
I'm deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
I'm down in, down in
Down in the hole
I'm deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in the hole, firing your load
Deep in the hole, sell your soul
Deep in, deep in
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in
That woman got me deep in the hole

[Outro]
Deep in the hole
Deep in the hole
I'm deep in the hole
