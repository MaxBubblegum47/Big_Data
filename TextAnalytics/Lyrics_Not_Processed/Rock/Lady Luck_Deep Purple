[Verse 1]
She was a juke-box dancer
A blue eyed gypsy queen
She always had an answer
For what she'd done
And where she'd been
A feathercane Lady Midnight
For all around to see
She spoke with words of wisdom
And this is what she said to me

[Chorus]
Lady luck
Come on give me what I want
Pull me up
Lady luck
If I see you again
I will call you my friend

[Verse 2]
I have always been a sinner
But then the lady came along
She stole my heart and turned me 'round
Until I didn't know right from wrong
She whispered words of kindness
I'd never ever heard before
Golden words and silver tongue
Till I really couldn't take no more

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Come on shake me
