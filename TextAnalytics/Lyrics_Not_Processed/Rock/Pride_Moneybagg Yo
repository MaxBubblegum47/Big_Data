[Chorus]
Let's put that bullshit behind us
Let's go where they can't even find us
Let's take it back to when I was breaking down dope in the trap baby you were my rider
Let's take it back to remind us
Before the fame and the cameras
Fuck it lets boost up the standards
Now that them haters can't stand us
We act like we don't wanna talk to each other
Let's put our pride to the side
We act like weon wanna fuck wit each other
Let's put that pride to the side
Come hop in the wraith wit a nigga
Look up, it got them stars inside
You got too much of that pride
You need to put that aside

[Verse 1]
You need to stop all that bullshit
Like you wanna talk to a nigga
Like you wanna rock wit a nigga
Be at the top wit a nigga
Call shots wit a nigga
Flex and floss wit a nigga
Trynna ack like uon even remember them days you stood on the block wit a nigga
Ian gone lie baby you do be trippin cause you be getting mad for no reason
Im finna go you get mad cause im leavin and you swear a nigga cheatin
Lets take it back to when we was ridin dirty
You put my dope in yo' cleavage
You took risk and got into it wit bitches and still was there I couldn't believe it
Sendin texts like fuck you im finna do me. Tired of lookin like a fool
And I be like cool ion give a fuck go head do you
One minute you this way the next one you that way you be in and out of moods
Pick a way you gotta chose
Or you gon' fuck around and lose

[Chorus]
Let's put that bullshit behind us
Let's go where they can't even find us
Let's take it back to when I was breaking down dope in the trap baby you were my rider
Let's take it back to remind us
Before the fame and the cameras
Fuck it lets boost up the standards
Now that them haters can't stand us
We act like we don't wanna talk to each other
Let's put our pride to the side
We act like weon wanna fuck wit each other
Let's put that pride to the side
Come hop in the wraith wit a nigga
Look up, it got them stars inside
You got too much of that pride
You need to put that aside

[Verse 2]
You all in yo' feelings constantly trippin casue ian come home last night
You slept all alone last night
Ian pick up the phone last night
Told you I was at the studio putting work in comin up wit hits
You like nah you a lie, you been laid up wit the bitch
I been goin hard at the grind
You so insecure up in the mind
You like yeh you buy me whatever I want, but all I really want is time
All I really want is you to be here and for you to stop all that lien
Then I walk away like fuck it bae
Ian trynna hear shit that you gotta say
Then there it go weon talk for some days cause our pride too big
Cause you feel like you right and I feel like Im right too busy actin like kids
Lets put the bullshit to the back of us
Double R's in the back of us
Lets have them millionaire vibes
Lets keep the pride to the side

[Chorus]
Let's put that bullshit behind us
Let's go where they can't even find us
Let's take it back to when I was breaking down dope in the trap baby you were my rider
Let's take it back to remind us
Before the fame and the cameras
Fuck it lets boost up the standards
Now that them haters can't stand us
We act like we don't wanna talk to each other
Let's put our pride to the side
We act like weon wanna fuck wit each other
Let's put that pride to the side
Come hop in the wraith wit a nigga
Look up, it got them stars inside
You got too much of that pride
You need to put that aside
