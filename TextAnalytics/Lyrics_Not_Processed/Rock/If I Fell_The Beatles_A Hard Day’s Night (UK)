[Intro: John Lennon]
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

[Bridge]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I fell in love with you
