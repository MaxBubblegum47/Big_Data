[Verse 1: KeY Wane]
Yeah, doin' doughnuts in the Porsche at the dealer
Listenin’ to Dilla
The Lord always made a way, yeah, that's my nigga
You used to drive the Honda Civic, nigga, I remember
I was being optimistic, I ain't have a pot to piss in
I was livin’ on my ex-girl couch, terrible
All my money kept goin' out
I ain't have enough to move, I felt like a vegetable
LIV, 2012, own your sectional
Damn, couple years later, I'm livin' exceptional
Spend thirty thousand, my Rollie came extra gold
Bitch ass niggas just mad I'm gettin' on

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Oh, oh, oh
Welcome to the terrordome
My, how my hair has grown
All I wanted was a Rollie and a 2Pac herringbone
Midwest kids, damn near all we used to hear was Bone
Two-family flat, mommy and aunt used to share a home
Boy, I rip your heart out and eat it while it's still beatin’ (Eat)
For no real reason, just 
blame it on killing season
Circle of life, top of the food chain, my new chain a circle of ice
My name deservin’ of lights
"The smartest thing you could do is stop music and finish school"
(Woah) Gotta be the dumbest shit I ever heard in my life
If yesterday is a tomb (Tomb), then tomorrow is the womb (Womb)
Waitin' on the Son of God ’cause he comin' back soon, hol' up
(Woah) Flashbacks of me dancin' in my living room was my first audition
Puff, Big, and Ma$e wavin’ gold bottles in the lenses like

[Interlude: Diddy & 
Big Sean
]
Never let me go, that's the worst feeling (
Woah
)
I still love you like my first million
You got me hypnotized like the scene with Big and I, reverse wheelin' (
Damn
)

[Verse 3: Big Sean & 
Diddy
]
Ciroc boys, blue circle business, that's full circle (
Yeah
)
Full circle like losin' friends from baggin' up yay to rappin' for Ye
Who dropped his first album, I was in the tenth grade
To ten years later, me droppin' a #1 the exact same day (
Yeah, yeah
)
Swear everything comes full circle, dawg, you just gotta wait
Full circle like, listenin' to Big to growin' up, they callin' you Big
(
Can you feel me?
)
Full circle like givin' your first Rolex to your first kid (
Yeah
)
Full circle like exactly what the fuck karma is
Full circle like every single thing I ever did

[Interlude: Diddy]
Yeah, niggas don't even make shit like this no more, ahaha
Shit lost, it's-it's a lost motherfuckin' art
I want the people out there in the world to hear me, though
I don't do it alone

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
Drop all that jealousy, that shit is gon' hurt you (Hurt you)
Quit givin' energy to ones that don't deserve you (They don't deserve)
You know everything come full circle
I just show love, watch it come full circle
And I could never let the bad vibes inside my circle, nah (Right now)
And loyalty deserves you (Yeah)
And tell the fuckin' truth even when it hurts to (Yeah-yeah)
But the most money come before the first two (Straight)
Don't worry, it'll come full circle (Yeah, look)

[Outro: Diddy]
Took all the pain that I knew and made songs
When God said, "Let there be light," he made Sean
