[Chorus]
I ain't got no time for no games
Tell me what you like but it's never gon' change
So you do what you wanna-wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
I ain't got no time for no games
I'm not being rude, can you give me my space
'Cause I do what I wanna-wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you

[Verse 1]
Your words are dead
Cheap lines are boring
So I do my thing
And keep on ignoring
You saw you're aware
I don't go around givin' my thing up, thing up
Have some respect, It's quite insulting
I don't wanna wake up with you in the morning
You tell me you're different
, 
excuse me for snoring
You liar, liar

[Chorus]
I ain't got no time for no games
Tell me what you like but it's never gon' change
So you do what you wanna-wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
I ain't got no time for no games
I'm not being rude, can you give me my space
'Cause I do what I wanna-wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you

[Verse 2]
No, baby don't tell me your story
You know I don't care
So why you persistent?
For now I am not, not gonna sleep with you
Stop now, stop now
Have some respect
Don't act like I'm blind
I can see your intent
I've spent way too much time
I have listened to this
Listened to shit from a player
You get no love

[Chorus]
I ain't got no time for no games
Tell me what you like but it's never gon' change
So you do what you wanna-wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
I ain't got no time for no games
I'm not being rude, can you give me my space
'Cause I do what wanna-wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
Oh, I'm not going
I'm not going home with you boy, no
I'm not going home with you, home with you

[Bridge]
Don't do this to me, nightmare
You got a nice face, big deal
Don't want what you got right here
Whoa
I won't hear you darling
'Cause I'm not your baby
Do I have to say it?
Say it again, again?

[Chorus]
I ain't got no time for no games
Tell me what you like but it's never gon' change
So you do what you want, what you wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
I ain't got no time for no games
I'm not being rude, can you give me my space
'Cause I do what I wanna-wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
Oh, you do what you wanna-wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
