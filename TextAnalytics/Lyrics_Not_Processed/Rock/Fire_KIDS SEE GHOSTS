[Intro: Kanye West]
I love all your shit talkin', I love all your shit talkin’
You ain't got nothin' better to... do with yourself?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I done proved to myself, back on that rulin’ myself
I got new news to tell, act like you knew you done failed
Only true know how I feel and only if you knew how I felt
Sniffed a lil' bootch off the nail
Through with mixed messages, through with the mail
Only a few in the field, little bit off for the real

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
It's so many days I prayed to God
All this pain, I couldn't seem to find a way
On a mission livin', carry on
Got my family, I'm seein' through better days
Never late, pull up a seat and come grab a plate
Check the date, let 'em hate
This the type shit that they couldn’t make, watch the fakes
Leave ’em buzzin', thought they wasn’t, huh?
Tell all your kinfolk and cousins, huh?
This is the package you ordered, huh?
Beautiful madness

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
On this road I find (hmm-mmm)
These scars I left behind (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)
On this road I find (hmm-mmm)
These scars I left behind (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)
