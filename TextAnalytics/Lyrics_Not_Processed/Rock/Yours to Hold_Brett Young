[Verse One]
When your vision fades to black and white
Cause your day hasn't gone quite right
Just remember I am never far
It doesn't matter where you are
Just reach your hands into the night
And see I've never left your side
Just like I swore so many times

[Chorus]
Just because you're gone
Doesn't mean that I've moved on
I still love you just the same
I still crumble at your name
Because the love you make me feel
Is the only thing that's real
And I need you to be alright
I'm forever yours to hold
Oh, as long as I have a life

[Verse Two]
When everything you know
Starts to let you down
And your world starts spinning round
I'll be the place where you can sleep
Cause in my heart you'll always be
More than a friend
More than time well spent
You show me who I'm supposed to be
And that makes you deserving

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
As long as I breathe
As long as I need
As long as I'm me
Oh, I belong to you
As long as I'm free
And as far as I see
If my heart still beats
Oh, then it beats for you

[Chorus Two]
Just because you're gone
Doesn't mean that I've moved on
I still love you just the same
I still crumble at your name
Because the love you make me feel
Is the only thing that's real
And I need you to be alright
Oh, just because you're gone
Doesn't mean that I've moved on
I still love you just the same
I still crumble at your name
Because the love you make me feel
Is the only thing that's real
And I need you to be alright
I'm forever yours to hold
Oh, as long as I have a life
As long as I have life
