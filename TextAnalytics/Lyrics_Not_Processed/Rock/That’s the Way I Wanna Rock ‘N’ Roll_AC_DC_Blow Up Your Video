[Verse 1]
Party gonna happen at the Union Hall
Shaking to the rhythm 'till everybody fall
Pickin' up my woman in my Chevrolet
Glory-hallelujah, gonna rock the night away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna take this town, turn it around
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll

[Verse 2]
Now there's a blue suede boppin' on a high-heeled shoe
Balling 'round together like a wrecking crew, said ha
Oh, be-boppa Lula, baby, what I'll say
You gotta get a dose of rock and roll on each and every day

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
I'm gonna blow up my video
Shut down my radio
Told boss man where to go
Turned off my brain control
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way I want my rock and roll, yeah
That's the way

[Solo]

[Breakdown]
Ooh, that's the way I like my rock and roll
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way
And that's the way
And that's the way I want my rock and roll
And that's the way
That's the way
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way
That's the way
To rock and roll

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna take this town, turn it around
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna roll (Roll, roll, roll)
That's the way I want it (Roll, roll, roll)
Gotta hear it loud
Gonna take the town, turn around, gonna roll
Roll, roll

[Chorus]
Blow up my video
Shut down my radio
I told the boss man where to go
Turned off my brain control
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way I want my rock and roll
