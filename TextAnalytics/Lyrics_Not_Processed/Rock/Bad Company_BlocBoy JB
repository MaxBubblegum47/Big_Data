[Intro: A$AP Rocky & Khloe Anna]
People think you're stuck up, but we're all super good friends
It's only natural, I suppose, but we're all super good friends
Um, I get the feeling that you're admired, but, um
I'm above average

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I got so much beef, I could barely sleep
Paranoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day
If you still frontin' when I up it, I'ma squeeze

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Bad company's bad for your company
Bad company's bad for your company
Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me
Got the Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & BlocBoy JB]
When I say I got beef, they don't want no beef
When they say they got beef, they don't wanna eat
If he said he wants smoke, they don't want no steam
She put a V on her tee, bad bad bad bad bad
Had a bachelors degree, Ph.D. while sellin' speed
Fix the face then fix the weave, now workin' on her self-esteem
Hit up Bloc (Brrr), "yo' this Flack, nigga, where you at?
Pin the drop, uh, my new map location be the block on the app"

[Interlude: BlockBoy JB]
I need money and company, nah nah
Bad bitches, I don't even know the company, hahahaha

[Verse 2: BlocBoy JB]
You—you—you can't hang baby, we don't want you 'round here
I—ice on my neck and it's froze, Santa's reindeer
Y—you got bad bitches, hella hoes, i—i—it's the same here
You bad company, lil' bro, you can't hang here
G—g—g—gettin' money so the bottles keep on comin'
Ph—ph—pho—pho—phone ringin' so you know the trap jumpin'
Tha—tha—that nigga lookin' at me, he owe me some money
Hit 'em with the Tommy, now that nigga crumpin'
Why—why these niggas playin' games? They don't want no problems with me
My shooters got good aim, you know I brought them shottas with me
Might have hit a bad stain, they say that someone top was missin'
Them niggas were opposition
They move wrong, so I shot them bitches

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Dark shades, too much smoke, I could barely see the fumes
Actin' brand new like I don't see you when I do
Who them folks? Who want smoke? You too close, give me room
Phony folks, play it close, do the most, don't they?

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Bad company, that's bad for your company
Bad company, that's bad for your company
Mad cow disease, now you in a ton of beef
Black Mac tucked underneath my new blue dungarees

[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Flintstone bust down, color Murakami
Fruity pebble bezel, Wilma, Betty, Fred, and Barney
Bad bitch from outta town, I think she model Abercrombie
Wrist game Lucky Charmy, told my jeweler Leprechaun me
I'ma come clean, I got hella beef
Paranoia got me rollin' up my sleeves, okay
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm uppin' up the fees
Whole team got V's on they tees, all day

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I got so much beef, I could barely sleep
Paranoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day
If you still frontin' when I up it, I'ma squeeze

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I'm above average
