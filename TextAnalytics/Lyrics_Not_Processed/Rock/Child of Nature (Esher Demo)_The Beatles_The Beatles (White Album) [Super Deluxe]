[Verse 1]
On the road to Rishikesh
I was dreaming more or less
And the dream I had was true
Yes the dream I had was true

[Chorus]
I'm just a child of nature
I don’t need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature’s children

[Verse 2]
Sunlight shining in my eyes
As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes my thoughts return to home

[Chorus]
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature's children

[Verse 3]
Underneath the mountain ranges
Where the wind never changes
Touch the windows of my soul
Touch the windows of my soul

[Chorus]
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I’m just a child of nature
I’m one of nature's children
