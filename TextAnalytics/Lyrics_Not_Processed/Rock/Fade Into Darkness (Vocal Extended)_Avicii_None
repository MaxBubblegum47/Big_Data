Looking up there's only sky
Rest your head I'll take you high
And we won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness

Why worry now, you'll be safe
Hold my hand, just in case

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

This world can seem cool and grey
But you and I are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness

Nothing to fear but fear itself
We'll be okay just keep the faith

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
