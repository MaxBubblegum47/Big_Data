[Verse 1]
We were high, burning vibes
Smoking in the air made it cloudy
I was dumb, we were drunk
Moving too fast like a six speed

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, without you by my side
Who else is gonna take this ride?
See you there, it's worth the try

[Chorus]
When you move like that
Reminds me of the good old times
You dance just the same
Like you did when you were mine
Can I hold you close
Even if it's just one night?
If I stole your heart
Would it be the perfect crime?
(Would it be the?)
(Would it be the?)
(Would it be the?)
Would it be the perfect crime?

[Verse 2]
I was wrong, you were right
Sorry that I made you doubt me
Reminisce the in between your
Now I'm just hoping you need me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause without you by my side
Who else is gonna take this ride?
See you there, it's worth the try, oh-wow

[Chorus]
When you move like that
Reminds me of the good old times
You dance just the same
Like you did when you were mine
Can I hold you close
Even if it's just one night?
If I stole your heart
Would it be the perfect crime?
(Would it be the?)
Yeah, yeah
(Would it be the?)
Mmm
(Would it be the?)
(Would it be the?)
Would it be the perfect crime?

[Breakdown]
When you move like that
Reminds me of the good old times
You dance just the same
Like you did when you were mine

[Outro]
Can I hold you close
Even if it's just one night?
If I stole your heart
Would it be the perfect crime?
