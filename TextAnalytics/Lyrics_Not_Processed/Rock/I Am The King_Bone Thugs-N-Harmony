Bone Bone Bone
Flip that track, done flip done flip that
Sometimes I braid my hair but then Sometimes I don't
Sometimes I braid it up
Sometimes I don't
Sometimes I follow the law but then Sometimes I won't
Most of the times I won't
In depends if im off indo and drinking
Might get out of control
If I'm drinking I'm geekin I'm tweakin
So before it's any drama I just thought I'd let yall know
So we can scratch the shit from the door

That Krayzie ain't that average nigga from your video
Who's out here screaming thug but we know really they hoes
Let you know that in this rap shit
Yall ain't fuckin with me
Because I am the king

I'm not that average nigga from your video
You always see me keep it real cause thats how I'm rollin
Now who could be a thug but so professionally?
Kayzie B-O-N-E

Always kept it real and never once tried fake
Cause I can make a million
And still don't have to brag about the money I make (make, make)
And my shit is still appealing
I dont spit it if I don't feel that it's real enough
Really I just don't feel it if the shit ain't Thug
Allll I know
Is I'm a nigga to hold my own
And that's why

That Krayzie ain't that average nigga from your video
Who's out here screaming thug but we know really they hoes
Let you know that in this rap shit
Yall ain't fuckin with me
Because I am the king

I'm not that average nigga from your video
You always see me keep it real cause thats how I'm rollin
Now who could be a thug but so professionally?
Kayzie B-O-N-E

Now why don't you niggas stop perpertraiting don't bull shit be yourself
Stop trying to be like someone else
Nigga be yourself
Quite tryin to live the thug life
If you ain't lived a thugs life
Wanna roll just like us
Wishin they had my car, my home, my Broad, my cloths, my thoughts, my Flows
Why do anybody wanna be a thug?
Shit I just dont know
They look at the video and see the Thugs got dough
They see the alcohol and all the Naked hot hoes
And think that's what it's all about But they don't really knoww..

(Chorus x2)
