[Verse 1]
I'll sing it one last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done
And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here

[Chorus]
Light up, light up, as if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder louder, and we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

[Verse 2]
To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbye
I nearly do

[Chorus]
Light up, light up, as if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder louder, and we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

[Chorus]
Light up, light up, as if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder louder, and we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say
