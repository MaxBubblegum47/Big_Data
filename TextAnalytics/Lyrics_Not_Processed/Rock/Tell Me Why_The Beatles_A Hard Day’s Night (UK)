[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

[Verse 1]
Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me, oh, so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan

[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

[Verse 2]
If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't, I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

[Verse 3]
Well I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you

[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
