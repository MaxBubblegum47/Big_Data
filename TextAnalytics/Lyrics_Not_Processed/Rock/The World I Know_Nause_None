I need dollar bills to feel something still
I don't wanna feel at all
I'm stripped to bare skin, ready to begin
Here is a man risk it all
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
Are you ready to dance
Ready to dance, ready to dance?
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
Are you ready to dance
Ready to dance, ready to dance?
I paid my dues, I've been running away from you
Wondering all confused
This is the world I know
My love has rusted, turning to ash and dust
Nobody you can trust
This is the world I know
Got away carrying storms, wake up to loved ones
I bleed like a waterfall
Scream out make a scene
Somebody rescue me
Here is a man in the middle of the fall
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
Are you ready to dance
Ready to dance, ready to dance?
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
Are you ready to dance
Ready to dance, ready to dance?
Oh,ohhh ooohh, oh this is the world I know
Won't you give me a chance
Give me a chance, give me a chance
Oh, ooooh, ooooh, oh this is the world I know
Won't you give me a chance
Give me a chance, give me a chance
I paid my dues, I've been running away from you
Wondering all confused
This is the world I know
My love has rusted, turning to ash and dust
Nobody you can trust
This is the world I know
This is the world I know
This is the world I know
