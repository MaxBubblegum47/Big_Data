[Verse 1]
I won't let my intuition cause you just stay in the dark
I know that I'm slowly wasting away, I'm keeping you from going down
I'm so scared of what will happen to you if I bring you closer
I wish it all cause your scared of the grave and yet it's trapped here lingering
I'm waiting patient, I wanna be back into your arms

[Chorus]
I just want you so bad, so bad
But I know you're too good for me
I just want so bad, so bad
But I know you're too good for me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know you said I just want you to go but I can't take your word
You left me with a connection with you that I can't just forget about
I slowly realize that I wasn't as part as I thought I was

[Chorus]
I just want you so bad, so bad
But I know you're too good for me
I just want so bad, so bad
And I know you're too good for me, yeah
Even when I'm so low, so low
You give me the high that I need
I just want so bad, so bad
But I know you're too good for me, yeah

[Bridge]
Tell me, tell me maybe
Why you're letting me go, why you're letting me go
I've been trying lately
Why won't you let me show cause I want you to know

[Chorus]
I just want you so bad, so bad
But I know you're too good for me
I just want so bad, so bad
And I know you're too good for me, yeah
Even when I'm so low, so low
You give me the high that I need
I just want so bad, so bad
But I know you're too good for me, yeah
