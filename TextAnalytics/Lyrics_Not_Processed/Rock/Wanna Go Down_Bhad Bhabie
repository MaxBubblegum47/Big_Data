Lyrics from snippet
[Chorus]
She just wanna go down
She just wanna go
She just wanna go down
She just wanna go
She just wanna go down
She just wanna go
She just wanna go
She just wanna go down

[Verse 1]
Shawty slow, got that ass low, shawty rollin off the north globe
Bad and boujiee like huncho, she only ride with da top flow (Top flow)
You know I need my money pronto, I fly killas on da top floor (Top floor)
I took the [?] she never see before, but I never think she really know (Know)

[Chorus]
She just wanna go
She just wanna go down
She just wanna go
She just wanna go down
She just wanna go
She just wanna go down
She just wanna go
She just wanna go
She just wanna go down
