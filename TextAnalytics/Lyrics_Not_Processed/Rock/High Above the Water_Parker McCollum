[Verse 1]
Hooked on money, hooked on chains
No more cripple, no more cane
How'd I do all I did, why won't you call me the kid
Best believe I'm afraid, shake it off everyday
You're like a record spinnin' 'round, I'm leavin' this town

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't been the way that it goes
Rather die alone from somethin' that I chose
Go out in style, go out on fire

[Chorus]
Livin' high, high, high
High above the water
Livin' high, high, high
High above the water

[Verse 2]
Dark as day, bright as night
That's the big city life
Trouble's always next door
Always beggin' for more
Give and take what you got
Make your way to the top
I won't ever come down
I feel what I've found

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't been the way that it goes
Rather die alone from somethin' that I chose
Go out in style, go out on fire

[Chorus]
Livin' high, high, high
High above the water
Livin' high, high, high
High above the water

[Bridge]
Finally given a shot in the dark
We're no longer living our lives twice as hard

[Chorus]
Livin' high, high, high
High above the water
Livin' high, high, high
High above the water

[Outro]
Hooked on money, hooked on chains
No more cripple, no more cane
How'd I do all I did, why won't you call me the kid
