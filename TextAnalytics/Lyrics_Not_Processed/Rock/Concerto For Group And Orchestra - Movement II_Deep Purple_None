How can I see
When the light is gone out
How can I hear
When you speak so silently
More than enough
Is never too much
Hold out a hand
I'm so out of touch
Do unto me
As your heart would have you do
Looks on my head
Cannot get the message through
Sword in my hand
Can cut through the wood
Peace in my heart
Can summon the mood

What shall I do
When they stand smiling at me
Look at the floor
And be oh so cool
Oh so cool

How shall I know
When to start singing my song
What shall I do
If they all go wrong
What shall I do
