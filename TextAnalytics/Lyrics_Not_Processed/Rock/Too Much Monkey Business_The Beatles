[Verse 1]
Running to and fro, hard
Working at the mail
Never fail
Get the mail
Yeah, some rotten deal
Ow!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to invite them again

[Verse 2]
Say me
Talking to me
Tryin' to run me up a creek
She used to buy one
Try to pay me again next week
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Long-haired, good-looking
Trying to get me hooked
Or me to marry
Settle down
Get the horn by the bull
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Mediocre money
Being fighting in the hall
Army bunk, army go
Army chow, army cook
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Same thing every day
Getting up, going to school
No need to make complaining
My objection's overruled
Ow!

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
Working in the filling station
Too many tires
Wipe the windows
Check the tire
Check the oil and all the gas
Ow!

[Chorus]
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Don't want your moderation, get away, leave me
