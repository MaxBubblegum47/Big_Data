[Intro]
Da na na na na, da na na na na
Da na na na na, my baby
You've been on my mind (How ya feel?)
I'm losing my mind because
I hope that we can be more than just friends

[Chorus]
Fireworks, I feel like glitter
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter (How ya feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life (How ya feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life

[Verse 1]
Ayo, mirror mirror on the wall, who the brightest of them all?
I never been the darkest one 'cause my self esteem is tall
So I never seen eye-to-eye with y'all niggas, ayo
Uno peso, never paid attention to what niggas gotta say-o
So I keep that buck, I ain't give no fuck
They ain't build me up so I block 'em like Lego
Feelin' glitter, feelin' good and great
Got the burner, got the heat, like wait
Got the shit, it's all up on that hip
I'll use it on myself on the day you dip
Got that 4, 5, 7, track 8 for me
Baby doll, I hope you agree
Because you light my

[Chorus]
Fireworks, I feel like glitter (I don't even know what that means)
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter
(How ya feel?) You're the one that I needed in my life
(How ya feel?) You're the one that I needed in my life
'Cause I love having you around (I love)
'Cause I love having you around

[Verse 2]
Yeah, look at my face, look at that joy
This is one sided, yeah, I can't lie
We ain't gon' work out, we a fat boy
Yeah, sumo, got it, memo
Pale skin see-through, must be a window
'Cause you ain't an L, could be a DJ
When I see you my heart beat changes tempo
Yeah, simple, that's what I want but I can't
That's who you are but I ain't (how ya feel?)
We can track 10 skiptrace, I'm caught in your quicksand, wait
Please don't save me

[Bridge]
Ooooh

How ya feel?

How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?

How ya feel?
