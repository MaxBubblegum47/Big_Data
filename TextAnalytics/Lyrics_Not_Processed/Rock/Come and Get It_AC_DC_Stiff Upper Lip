[Verse 1]
Pickin' up the sleaze in my car
Hell, no distance too far
Burnin' down the road in the night
Don't you scold me, or I'll bite

[Pre-Chorus]
These are the finer things in life
Don't think you live in paradise
I've got my filly wrapped in red
Upon my double-decker bed

[Chorus]
If you want it, come and get it (come and get it)
If you want it, come and get it (come and get it)
If you want it, come and get it (come and get it)
If you want it, come and get it

[Verse 2]
Sucking up the juice in the bar
Downin' every shooter, so far
Checking out the girls, what a sight
If you going to blow me, do it right

[Pre-Chorus]
These are the finer things in life
Don't think you live in paradise
I've got my filly wrapped in red
Upon my double-decker bed

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus] (x2)
