[Verse 1]
Let me tell you your fortune
It could be sinister, or maybe not
Like a leopard, can't change it's own spots

[Pre-Chorus]
Ride a moonbeam
Sail the starlight
My blaze in the night sky
See the witch's flight

[Chorus]
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

[Verse 2]
Good time maker who likes it hot
Like a card playin' shark who takes the whole lot
(And that's a lot)

[Pre-Chorus]
Riding moonbeam
Sail the starlight
My blaze in the night sky
See the witch's flight

[Chorus]
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

[Bridge]
It's all coming to ya
It's all coming through ya
I get bathed in a light
The spell's just right

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

Crystal balls and an almanac
She gonna take you to hell and back
I've got potions, snake oil style
Good luck charms and a witch's spell
