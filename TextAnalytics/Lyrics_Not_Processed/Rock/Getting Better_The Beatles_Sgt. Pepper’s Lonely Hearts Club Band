[Intro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison]
It's getting better all the time

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down (Ah-ah), turning me 'round (Ah-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool, you fool)

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!

[Post-Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Fool, you fool)

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!

[Post-Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

[Outro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, and George Harrison]
Getting so much better all the time!
