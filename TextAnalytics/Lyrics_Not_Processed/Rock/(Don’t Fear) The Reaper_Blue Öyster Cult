[Intro]

[Verse 1: Buck Dharma]
All our times have come
Here, but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain

[Chorus: Buck Dharma]
(We can be like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2: Buck Dharma]
Valentine is done
Here, but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity
 
(Romeo and Juliet)
40,000 men and women everyday
 
(Like Romeo and Juliet)
40,000 men and women everyday
 
(Redefine happiness)
Another 40,000 coming everyday

[Chorus: Buck Dharma]
(We can be like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3: Buck Dharma]
Love of two is one
Here, but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
The door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared

[Alternative Chorus: Buck Dharma]
(Saying, "don't be afraid") Come on, baby
(And she had no fear) And she ran to him
(Then she started to fly) They looked backward and said goodbye
(She had become like they are) She had taken his hand
(She had become like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper)
