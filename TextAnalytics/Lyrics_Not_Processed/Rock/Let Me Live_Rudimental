[Intro: Mr Eazi]
Rudimental
Major Lazer

[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
As I walk through the water, so many things I see, uh-huh
And then I say to myself, "It’s never as it seems"

[Refrain: Anne-Marie]
'Cause I am the one, I rule my world
Nobody rule my destiny
'Cause you are the one, you rule your world
No bad man own your destiny

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, make I live my life
Leave me alone, make I live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, let me—

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
Are we losing control, or is it meant to be, uh-huh?
Now I’ve opened my mind, come and set me free

[Refrain: Anne-Marie]
'Cause I am the one, I rule my world
Nobody rule my destiny
'Cause you are the one, you rule your world
No bad man own your destiny

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, make I live my life
Leave me alone, make I live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, make I live my life
Leave me alone, make I live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, let me—

[Post-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Why don't you leave me alone?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Mr Eazi]
I will do anything I like
I will sip anything I like
E be me way I get my life
E be me way I get my life
I no say it's alright
I'de catch some vibes tonight
Everyday, every night, everyday
Feel the love, yo

[Bridge: Anne-Marie, Mr Eazi & Anne-Marie]

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Why don't you live your life? Yeah
And I'll go live mine

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, make I live my life (Why don't you live your life?)
Leave me alone, make I live it up, live it up (And I will go live mine)
Leave me alone, let me—

[Post-Chorus: Anne-Marie, Mr Eazi & Anne-Marie]
