[Verse 1]
Another paper in my front yard
Another wave at the crossing guard
Parking lot spot 29
Ain't nothing different but the car next to mine
And I let that song on the radio fade before I ever open the door
And it's a Xerox copy, identical twin of the 24 hours before

[Chorus]
Baby in the meantime
In the in-between time
All I do is think about you
Just another hey, hey
Weekends on the way, hey
Just another Monday
And a Tuesday nothing left to lose day
Wednesday and a Thursday look just like the first day
Friday night to Sunday all roll into one day
Just another day without you, ah baby

[Verse 2]
It ain't Cheers but they all know my name
A coke can, a beer can, it's all the same
I always leave at 11:03
I know what's good and what's bad for me
I could roll through this routine in my sleep if only I could sleep at all
And the news and the weather say, it's gonna get better but not if you never call

[Chorus]
Baby in the meantime
In the in-between time
All I do is think about you
Just another hey, hey
Weekends on the way, hey
Just another Monday
And a Tuesday nothing left to lose day
Wednesday and a Thursday look just like the first day
Friday night to Sunday all roll into one day
Just another day without you, ah baby

[Bridge]
And I could roll through this routine in my sleep if only I could sleep at all
And the news and the weather say, it's gonna get better but not if you never call

[Chorus]
Baby in the meantime
In the in-between time
All I do is think about you
Just another hey, hey
Weekends on the way, hey
Just another Monday
And a Tuesday nothing left to lose day
Wednesday and a Thursday look just like the first day
Friday night to Sunday all roll into one day
Just another day without you, ah baby

[Outro]
Just another day without you, uh, huh
Oh yeah, baby
Living just another day without you baby, mm, hmm
No, no, no
