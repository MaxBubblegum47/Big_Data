[Intro]
Hello little girl
Hello little girl
Hello little girl

[Verse 1]
When I see you everyday
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When you're passing on your way
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I see you passing by
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I try to catch your eye
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"

[Verse 2]
I send you flowers but you don't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I often wonder what you're thinking of
I hope it's me and love love love

So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say, "Mm you're my little girl"

[Verse 3]
It's not the first time that it's happened to me
It's been a long lonely time
And it's funny funny to see that I'm about to lose my mind mind mind

[Verse 4]
So I hope there'll come a day
When you say, "Mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm"
You're my little girl, oh yeah
You're my little girl

[Outro]
Do do do do do
