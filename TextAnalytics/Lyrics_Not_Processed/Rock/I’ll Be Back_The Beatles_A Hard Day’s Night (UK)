[Verse 1]
You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

[Bridge 1]
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Verse 2]
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

[Bridge 2]
I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Verse 3]
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

[Bridge 1]
I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Outro]
You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
