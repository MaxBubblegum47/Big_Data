Always just a little lonesome always just a little blue
Always want to cry a little when I remember you
And though this broken heart you've left me
Don't ache the way it used to do
I'm only just a little lonesome always just a little blue

Always just a little lonesome always just a little blue
Always get that little heartache each time I think of you
Somebody else may make me happy
But in my heart I know it's true
I'll always be a little lonesome always I'll always be a little blue
