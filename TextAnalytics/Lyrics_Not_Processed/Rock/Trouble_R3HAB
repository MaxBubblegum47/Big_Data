[Verse 1]
I know you love her, love her
But deep down under the covers, covers
Does she know that I am the other, other
Does she?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well it's not like I planned this, planned this
But you were so fucking romantic, romantic
Why you always acting so frantic, frantic
Listen to me
Just love me, love me, love me, love me when the lights go down
And hold me, hold me, hold me till it's dawn
And maybe you can make me forgive myself
And leave me, leave me, leave me when it's done

[Chorus]
'Cause you've been nothing but trouble
I know what you're up to
Trying to get into my head
'Cause you've been nothing but trouble
I know what you're up to
Play it over and over again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
No I won't blow your cover, cover
I know it's not your fault that you love her, love her
And I'm betting that you will discover
I'm not someone you can try to keep

[Pre-Chorus]
Well it's not like I planned this, planned this
But you were so fucking romantic, romantic
Why you always acting so frantic, frantic
Listen to me
Just love me, love me, love me, love me when the lights go down
And hold me, hold me, hold me till it's dawn
And maybe you can make me forgive myself
And leave me, leave me, leave me when it's done

[Chorus]
'Cause you've been nothing but trouble
I know what you're up to
Trying to get into my head
'Cause you've been nothing but trouble
I know what you're up to
Play it over and over again

[Instrumental Break]
