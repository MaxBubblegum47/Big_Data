[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh)
Li-li-lies, li-lies
(Ooh, ooh)
Li-li-lies, li-lies (Ooh, ooh)
Oh, oh (Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Tell you that I love you just to make you stay
You tell me I'm toxic but you love me that way, that way
And, girl, I be missin' you, but just not today
I really miss kissin' you, girl, what's the play? What's the play?
Hit you up on the late nights just to chill
You say you poppin' Perkies, let's pop a pill
They say, "It's for my anxiety," yeah
You are for my sobriety, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Let me pop up at your crib
Let me show you what it is
Let me give yo' ass the biz, the biz
I really hate to play this way
You know that my love is fake
My intentions are real
But you never know what they is
You never know what they is
Tellin' you lies, li-li-li-lies, straight to yo' face

[Bridge]
I'm a flirt, I'm a jerk, and you know it
Never been to a buzz, I always had an exponent, oh
Hit you up, like

[Chorus]
Let me pop up at your crib
Let me show you what it is
Let me give yo' ass the biz, the biz
I really hate to play this way
You know that my love is fake
My intentions are real
But you never know what they is
You never know what they is
Tellin' you lies, li-li-li-lies, straight to yo' face

[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh —)
