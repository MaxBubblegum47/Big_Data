[Verse 1]
Take the trouble to decide the things you do
Will not be the things that don't appeal to you
See the mess your making  can't you see your faking
Going to make it hard for you, you're going to--into the fire
Turn on to the mandrake that was given to you
See if you can make it like the others do

[Chorus]
Feel the blood a knocking when you're finger popping
Going to make it hard for you, you're going into the fire

[Verse 2]
Stop your bleeding mind before it's over and done
Listen very closely to the message I've sung

[Chorus]
