[Verse 1]
I've been lonely, missing your body
You've been out of touch, you're so far away
Wishing you would tell me you're sorry
And you know you made a big mistake
Close my eyes and try to forget you
Every time I do, I just see your face
After all this shit that we've been through
Why are you so willing to walk away?

[Chorus]
I don't know why I stick around to watch you burn our bridges down
I can't help it that I need you (need you)
I can't help it that I need you (need you)
Now I'm drowning underneath the water that was under me
I'm still screaming that I need you (need you)
(I can't help it that I need you)

[Post-Chorus]
Burn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down
Burn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
You left me with a craving I can't fill
Got me wondering what I had yesterday
Tell everyone I'm fine, but I'm still
Sitting here, choking on the aftertaste

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't stay away from you, I try, I try
But you got a grip on my mind

[Chorus]
I don't know why I stick around to watch you burn our bridges down
I can't help it that I need you (need you)
I can't help it that I need you (need you)
Now I'm drowning underneath the water that was under me
I'm still screaming that I need you (need you)
(I can't help it that I need you)

[Post-Chorus]
Burn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down
Burn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't stay away from you, I try, I try
But you got a grip on my mind

[Chorus]
Now I'm drowning underneath the water that was under me
I'm still screaming that I need you (need you)
(I can't help it that I need you)

[Post-Chorus]
Burn the bridges, burn them down
Burn the bridges, burn them down
Burn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down
Burn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down, down
