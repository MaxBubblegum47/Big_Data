[Verse 1]
Take away my eyes
Take away my ears, take it all away from me
Take away my arms
Take away my knees, you can blame it all on me
Take away my heart
Take away my soul, take it all away from me
Take away my dreams
Take away my goals, you can blame it all on me

[Chorus]
I'm a mess and I will always be
Do you want to stick around and see
Me drown? Hmm
Fuck, I'm about to lose it all
I'm a drunk and I will always be
Beggin', "Baby, take my hand before
I fall back down"
Fuck, I'm about to lose it all

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, baby
Won't you come back for me?
Won't you come back for me?
Oh, baby
Won't you come back for me?
Won't you come back for me?

[Verse 2]
Take away my shirt
Take away my shoes, take it all away from me
Take away my guilt
Take away my shame, you can blame it all on me
Take away my love
Take away my hate, take it all away from me
Take away my fears
Take away my faith, you can blame it all on me

[Chorus]
I'm a mess and I will always be
Do you want to stick around and see
Me drown? Hmm
Fuck, I'm about to lose it all
I'm a drunk and I will always be
Beggin', "Baby, take my hand before
I fall back down"
Fuck, I'm about to lose it all

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, baby
Won't you come back for me?
Won't you come back for me?
Oh, baby
Won't you come back for me?
Won't you come back for me?

[Chorus]
I'm a mess and I will always be
Do you want to stick around and see
Me drown? Hmm
Fuck, I'm about to lose it all
I'm a drunk and I will always be
Beggin', "Baby, take my hand before
I fall back down"
Fuck, I'm about to lose it all

[Collision]
I'm a mess and I will always be
Oh, baby
Do you want to stick around and see
Me drown? Hmm
Won't you come back for me?
Fuck, I'm about to lose it all
Won't you come back for me?
I'm a drunk and I will always be
Oh, baby
Beggin', "Baby, take my hand before
I fall back down"
Won't you come back for me?
Fuck, I'm about to lose it all
Won't you come back for me?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, baby
Won't you come back for me?
Won't you come back for me?
Oh, baby
Won't you come back for me?
Won't you come back for me?
