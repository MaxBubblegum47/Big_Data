[Verse 1]
You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did you say that she's pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Verse 2]
So I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me, no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did you say that she's pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh no, and can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Chorus]
Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well, I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

[Bridge]
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
(Give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Was I just a fool?
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
(Give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
(Was I just a fool)

[Chorus]
Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
