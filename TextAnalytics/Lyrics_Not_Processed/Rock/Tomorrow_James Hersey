[Verse:]
When you gonna come up?
I know you've got lots to do
But I've got nothing all summer
You say it ain't chic
But you can stay in my home
Sleep 'til you don't need no more
And we can get stoned
And talk about tomorrow like it's
Here

[Chorus:]
We can make it work out if you try to hold on
We can write this story on our own out here
We can make this feel like it could never go wrong
If we can find a way back, just don't say that it's gone
Don't say that it's gone

[Verse:]
Where you been lately?
I see you've got shows around the whole world
Isn't that crazy?
Used to be just you and me
Right here in my home
Dance like we don't care no more
And we could get stoned
And dream about tomorrow like it's
Here

[Chorus:]
We can make it work out if you try to hold on
We can write this story on our own out here
We can make this feel like it could never go wrong
If we can find a way back, just don't say that it's gone
Don't say that it's gone

[Bridge:]
I swear I'll lose my mind
If you don't stop changing yours
If you come back this time
Oh baby, you better be sure we can be more...

[Chorus/Outro:]
'Cause we can make it work out, if you try to hold on
We can write this story, on our own out here
We can make this feel like, it could never go wrong
If we can find a way back, just don't say that it's gone
We can make it work out, if you try to hold on
We can write this story on our own out here
We can make this feel like it could never go wrong
If we can find a way back, just don't say that it's gone
Don't say that it's gone
