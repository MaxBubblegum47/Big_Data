[Intro: Paul McCartney]
(Roll up! Roll up for the magical mystery tour!
Step right this way!)

[Verse: Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and (John Lennon)]
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (and that's an invitation), roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (to make a reservation), roll up for the mystery tour

[Chorus 1: Paul McCartney]
The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away

[Verse: Paul McCartney, John Lennon and (George Harrison)]
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (we've got everything you need), roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (satisfaction guaranteed), roll up for the mystery tour

[Chorus 2: Paul McCartney]
The magical mystery tour is hoping to take you away
Hoping to take you away

[Bridge]
A mystery trip

[Verse: John Lennon, George Harrison, and (Paul McCartney)]
Aaaah... the magical mystery tour
Roll up, roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (and that's an invitation), roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up (to make a reservation), roll up for the mystery tour

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
The magical mystery tour is coming to take you away
Coming to take you away
The magical mystery tour is dying to take you away
Dying to take you away, take you today

[Outro]
