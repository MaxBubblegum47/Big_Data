[Verse]
All I can see are headlights
We're driving in late December
I made you mine at midnight
Tell me, do you remember?

[Chorus]
And it's hard to pretend that I'm alright
Hard to forgive, I can’t empathize
And it's hard to relax, I don't know why
But you make it hard to say goodbye
But you make it hard to say goodbye
But you make it hard to say goodbye
Say goodbye

[Verse]
All I can see are headlights
We're driving in late December
I made you mine at midnight
Tell me, do you remember?

[Chorus]
And it's hard to pretend that I'm alright
Hard to forgive, I can’t empathize
And it's hard to relax, I don't know why
But you make it hard to say goodbye
But you make it hard to say goodbye
But you make it hard to say goodbye
Say goodbye
But you make it hard to say goodbye
