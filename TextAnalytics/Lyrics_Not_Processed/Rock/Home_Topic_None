[Verse 1: Nico Santos]
I'm halfway gone
We fought long enough, long enough and
We were holding ropes
But untied to love, untied to love saying
If we had a moment we could ignite
Instead it seems we're trying hard to start a fight
'long these streets you read my words in the night
You hear me call

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me come home to you, let me come home to you again
Don't let me lose you too
Your smile still echoes through my head
Let me come home to you, let me come home to you again
Don't let me lose you too
Tell me would you let me in

[Chorus]
Home again
Home again

[Verse 2: Nico Santos]
I'm losing light, see me burning out, burning out and
I guess all these nights will be lonely hours, lonely hours thinking
If we had a moment we could ignite
Instead it seems we're trying hard to start a fight
'long these streets you read my words in the night
You hear me call

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me come home to you, let me come home to you again
Don't let me lose you too
Your smile still echoes through my head
Let me come home to you, let me come home to you again
Don't let me lose you too
Tell me would you let me in

[Chorus]
Home again
Home again
