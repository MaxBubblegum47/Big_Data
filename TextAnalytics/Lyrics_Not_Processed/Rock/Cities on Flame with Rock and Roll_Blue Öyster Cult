[Verse 1: Albert Bouchard]
My heart is black and my lips are cold
Cities on flame with rock and roll
Three thousand guitars, they seem to cry
My ears will melt and then my eyes

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard]
Let the girl, let that girl, rock and roll
Cities on flame now with rock and roll

[Verse 2: Albert Bouchard]
Gardens of Nocturne, forbidden delight
Reins of steel and it's alright
Cities on flame with rock and roll
Marshall will buoy, but Fender control

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard]
So let the girl, let that girl, rock and roll
Cities on flame now with rock and roll

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Albert Bouchard]
My heart is black and my lips are cold
Cities on flame with rock and roll
Three thousand guitars, they seem to cry
My ears will melt and then my eyes

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard]
So let the girl, let that girl, rock and roll
Cities on flame now with rock and roll

[Instrumental Outro]
