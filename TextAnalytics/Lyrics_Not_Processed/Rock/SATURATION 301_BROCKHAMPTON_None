[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
MERLYN!
Bet she flicking like Tiger the tee
And she make her wanna hold onto me
And she wanna rip my tee
And she wanna do hunting
Ain't see nothing, I don't do no fret
I don't do no, no Skyping thing
I don't do no, no testing thing
I don't do no best friending--
MERLYN!

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I hold my hands above everything
I fuck the world up, a wedding ring
I hold the mic like I'm Heather B
I hold the mic up, let the world let me
See all the things that I want to see
One-two-three, right in front of me
Back in the day when my sister let me watch MTV before I sleep

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I don't see opposition near
Shoot the frame like I'm Lars von Trier
Won't succumb or run from my fears
For the Melancholia from my peers
Cloud above my head, hide my tears
Hydroplane while I'm shifting gears
Loop-de-loop down Mulholland Drive
Hope I land in a newer life
On a new star, on a new pitch
In a new world with a new whip
Hit light speed when I tap that gas
I won't hide from what's in my past
I don't need you lames in my life
Don't need fame to go shine my light
Bigger picture ain't in your sight
Imma paint a vision, IMAX tonight

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I paid for fame, I should've kept my receipts
Sold my soul for a handful of weed
Still got holes in my hands and my feet
I turn pain into Sprite with the lean
Mark of the beast
Real big dog need a bone and a leash
I see demons when I'm fallin' asleep
Shadows leaving like they following me
Sold out show, but I'm still alone
Dress my best when I feel depressed
So I ain't taking no shit tonight
Quarter ounce of that kryptonite
Burn it down and I feel alright
I can't seem to outrun my problems
I get high and I never solve 'em
Roll it up and I burn my sorrow

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la

[Verse 5: Matt Champion]
Front seat, back seat, also in shotgun
Bangin' on the door like we gon' fuck it all up
All these living means they ain't fuckin' with me
Bet you thought babygirl had me down to a T
Take one to the drug spot, one to the bank
One to the summer till ya see what y'all think
Six feet under block, opp need a angel (angel)
Bean bags under my eyes like a zombie (zombie)
Someone lift the top like a purple badge (woo woo)
Weird eye color make ya bug out
When I scroll through, little me in my head, voodoo
Goo goo goo joob, early birdie get the Beatle
Fuck it up, let the meter run (meter run, meter run)
Life's short, have a little fun (little fun, little fun)
I don't give a fuck about you, yes, I gotta run
Need a smoke, damn, black lung

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Back and forth, no, I can't lie
Arrive at your front door, I came high, fo' sho'
Is this what you want to be? Is this what you want to be? (fo' sho')
Tell me what you wanna be, tell me who you gonna be
Back and forth, no, I can't lie
Arrive at your front door, I came high, fo' sho'
Is this what you want to be? Is this what you want to be? (fo' sho')
Tell me what you wanna be, tell me who you gonna be

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
