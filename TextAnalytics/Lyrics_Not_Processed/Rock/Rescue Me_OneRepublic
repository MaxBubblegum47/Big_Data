[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love? If I need your help?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?

[Verse 1]
We don't talk much, not anymore
Broken bottles and slammin' doors
But we still care about each other
Say we care about each other
I know life took us far away
But I still dream 'bout the good old days
When we took care of each other
We were livin' for each other

[Pre-Chorus]
But I start to wonder, wonder
If I'm slipping under, under (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah
Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?)
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I miss all the times we had
Can't forget what you can't get back
And you can't find it in another
Man, time, it ain't your lover
I don't care what you thought before
I'll be there anytime you call
Don't you ever call another
No need to call another

[Pre-Chorus]
And I start to wonder, wonder
If I'm slipping under, under (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah
Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?)
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me? (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Would you rescue me?
Oh, rescue me (Would you rescue me?)
Would you rescue me? (When I'm by myself?)
(When I need your love, if I need your help)
Oh, rescue me
(Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?)

[Chorus]
Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?
