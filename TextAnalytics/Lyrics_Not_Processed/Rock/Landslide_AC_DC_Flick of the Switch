[Intro]
I want you to hear me out there
This is for all you bad boys
This is a story of "The Satan: Rock and Roll"
I want you to put your hand in your pocket
Take ten dollars out and send it to me, ha ha

[Pre-Chorus]
Galileo
And Big Ben
Listen to me, baby
I'm gonna say it again

[Verse 1]
Well, momma don't scold her son
For what he been doin' upstairs
Daddy dont' take him out, no-no
His sister just a-pull his hair
This boy is lost
It's a living nightmare
It ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus]
That boy he don't know how to lose
He's out to win
He got the lot to top the last shot
Shaker, he's a breaker, he's a maker

[Chorus]
He's a landslide
Landslide
Walking, talking, rocking landslide

[Verse 2]
Now, momma, he ain't no toy
And never, ever get his share
Got his smack in a gunnysack
Still'll be room for air
This boy is lost
It's a rockin' double dare, he's out to scare

[Pre-Chorus]
That boy he don't know how to lose
He's out to win
He got the lot to top the last shot
Shaker, he's a breaker, he's a maker

[Chorus]
He's a landslide
Landslide
Walking, talking, rocking landslide

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Landslide, landslide, landslide, landslide

[Verse 4]
Well, preacher done say his prayer
Take him to the promised land
Momma don't allow, no, get outta here!
Never gonna give a damn
This boy is lost
Like a rebel for a cause
But he's the boss

[Pre-Chorus]
That boy, he don't know how to lose
He's on a whim
He got the lot to top the last shot
Breaker, he's a shaker, he's a maker

[Chorus]
He's a landslide
Landslide
Walking, talking, rocking landslide
Landslide
Walking, talking, rocking landslide
Landslide, landslide
That man's a one man landslide
Landslide
Landslide
Landslide
That boy's a walk, talk, rockin' landslide
Get down
