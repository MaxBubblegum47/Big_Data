[Verse 1]
Crashed out of the market, out on the floor
Washed up on the shore
Bombed outta the city, out of the door
Blown up against the wall
Put out of the picture, ax about to fall
Walk before you crawl
Dragged down to the bottom, screaming for air
The shark must get his share

[Pre-Chorus]
You could see it coming
Miles and miles away
Women, drink and money
Are going to make you pay

[Chorus]
Snowballed, ooh yeah
Snowballed, they done it again
Snowballed, making me blind
Snowballed

[Verse 2]
The howl of the wolf, snow in his eye
Waiting to take you by surprise
Eye of the needle, heat of the fight
Watch those teeth, 'cause they're ready to bite

[Pre-Chorus]
You can see it coming
Miles and miles away
Women, drink and money
Are going to make you pay

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
