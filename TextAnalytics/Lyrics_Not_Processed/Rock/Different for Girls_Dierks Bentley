[Verse 1: Dierks Bentley]
She don't throw any t-shirt on and walk to a bar
She don't text her friends and say, "I gotta get laid tonight."
She don't say, "It's okay, I never loved him anyway."
She don't scroll through her phone just looking for a Band-Aid

[Chorus: Both]
It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls

[Verse 2: Elle King (Both)]
She don't sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
She don't have the luxury to let herself go
(She won't call just to curse
Found a wall she can punch
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough)

[Chorus: Both]
It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls

[Bridge: Dierks Bentley]
It's different for girls
Nobody said it was fair
When love disappears, they can't pretend it was never there

[Outro: Both]
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough
So tough
It's different for girls
It's different for girls
