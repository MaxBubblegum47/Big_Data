[Chorus]
I've been waiting until midnight
Slowly dying since the sunrise
'Cause I, I was born, I was born to the night
In the night, in the night, I survive
All the poison, the pleasure, the highs
I was born, I was born to

[Verse 1]
Be so insane, I tell my heart to sleep all day
'Cause I don't wanna deal with anything, I need a break
Dusk 'til dawn, in the city where the wild things are
When the wolves are out, no doubt they're crying out my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Screamin' woo-oo-ooh
I'm in a moo-oo-ood
My leather boo-oo-oots
Are coming out, coming out

[Chorus]
I've been waiting until midnight
Slowly dying since the sunrise
'Cause I, I was born, I was born to the night
In the night, in the night, I survive
All the poison, the pleasure, the highs
I was born, I was born to

[Verse 2]
Just face my fears, makin' friends with all my demons here
Now all my insecurities, they leave the atmosphere

[Pre-Chorus]
Screamin' woo-oo-ooh
I'm in a moo-oo-ood
My leather boo-oo-oots
Are coming out, coming out

[Chorus]
I've been waiting until midnight
Slowly dying since the sunrise
'Cause I, I was born, I was born to the night
In the night, in the night, I survive
All the poison, the pleasure, the highs
I was born, I was born to the night

[Bridge]
The night is my mother, the sky is my brother
And I'm the daughter of star-crossed lovers
The night is my mother, the sky is my brother
And I'm the daughter of star-crossed lovers

[Chorus]
'Cause I ('Cause I), I was born, I was born to the night
In the night, in the night, I survive
All the poison, the pleasure, the highs
I was born, I was born to the night
