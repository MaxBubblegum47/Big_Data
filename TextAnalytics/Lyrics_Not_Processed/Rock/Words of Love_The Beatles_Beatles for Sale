[Verse 1]
Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real

[Verse 2]
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you

[Instrumental Verses]

[Verse 3]
Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling, when you're near

[Verse 2]
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you
