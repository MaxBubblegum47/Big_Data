[Verse 1]
Love me tender, love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so

[Chorus]
Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you
And I always will

[Verse 2]
Love me tender, love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part

[Chorus]
Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you
And I always will

[Verse 3]
Love me tender, love me dear
Tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years
Till the end of time

[Chorus]
Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you
And I always will
