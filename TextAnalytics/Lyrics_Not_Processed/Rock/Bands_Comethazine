[Chorus]
Bands-bands-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch, ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
'Fore I up my rocket
Ooh, bands-bands-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch, ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
'Fore I up my rocket

[Verse]
Ayy, pull up with a choppa, let it eat, hey (I let it eat)
Yeah, walkin', Jesus sandals on my feet, yeah (On my feet, yeah)
Ooh, talk with shiny gold up on my teeth, yeah (On my teeth, yeah)
Ooh, and I'm rockin' Goyard and Supreme, ayy (And Supreme, yeah)
Yeah, pull up with the choppa, watch 'em freeze, ooh (Watch 'em freeze)
I got a shooter, he gon' take off his knees, ayy (Take off his knees)
All it take is two shots, watch his body drop, yuh (Watch his body drop)
Bitches on my dick 'cause I skrrt off the lot (I skrrt off the lot)
Ayy, Skechers on my feet, but I'm a rich guy, yah (I'm a rich nigga)
Cannot fuck with hoes 'cause they be picking sides (Just pick a nigga)
Ayy, ice-ice-ice, that's my neck talkin' (Shiny, talkin')
Ooh, and I'm rocking Goyard and Supreme, ayy (That's that check)

[Chorus]
Bands-band-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch, ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
'Fore I up my rocket
Ooh, bands-bands-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch, ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
'Fore I up my rocket

[Outro]
Ooh, bands-bands-bands, that's a check talkin'
Take off your pants-pants-pants
Bitch, ain't no time for talkin'
Watch me do my dance-dance-dance-dance
Bands in my pocket
Come and get your mans-mans-mans
'Fore I up my rocket
