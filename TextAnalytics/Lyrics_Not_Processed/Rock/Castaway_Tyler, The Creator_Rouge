[Verse 1: Yuna]
Hold up
Got a minute for me?
Yeah, I know I just show up (Mmm)
Didn't know I gotta call before
Maybe you could spare a minute
Sit down, you said I got way too much confidence

[Chorus: Yuna]
Honestly
You didn't see the best in me
It feels like you're mocking me
And now I've gone off so far away
A castaway

[Verse 2: Yuna]
But you don't even remember what you did back then
Oh, yeah (Mmm)
Now, it didn't take forever for me to move on
Make it work somehow

[Chorus: Yuna]
I know, honestly
You didn't see the best in me (You didn't see the best in me)
It feels like you're mocking me
And now I've gone off so far away
A castaway

[Verse 3: Yuna]
I think about what we had
I guess I always known I've never had the chance
You were never gonna give me a fair shot, yeah
Leave it all in the past
No use tryna dig up all the good times, too bad
You got way too much confidence (Yeah)

[Chorus: Yuna]
Honestly (Honestly)
It wasn't so hard to see (Oh)
That you're not the one for me (You're not the one for me)
Yeah, I'd rather be so far away
A castaway

[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
Ayo, no point in lyin', no point in tryin' anymore
Change of direction and now I'm flyin' to the door
Am I bein' used? Question kinda dumb
It's rhetorical in sum, at this point, I wanna run
I don't need no handout
I'ma cook solo and we'll see how it pan out
May get too hot, I might have to bring the fan out now
To drown you out, I ain't know it could blow that loud, damn
We don't work out, big belly is on horizon
You don't hear me now, you really don't have Verizon
Yeah, we need silence, 'cause I need help
If I was a pair of pants, I'd be looking for a belt
'Cause you always bring me down and I'm lookin' for an up
So it's got me to a point where I do this to myself
Am I bein' used? Question kinda dumb
It's rhetorical in sum, at this point, I wanna run

[Bridge: Yuna]
Gotta get, gotta get, hey
Gotta get, gotta get, hey
Gotta get, gotta get, hey
Gotta get, gotta get, hey
Gotta get, gotta get, hey
Gotta get, gotta get away
Gotta get, gotta get, hey
Bet you don't even remember, yeah

[Chorus: Yuna]
Honestly (Honestly)
You didn't see the best in me (You didn't see the best in me)
It feels like you're mocking me (It feels like you're mocking me)
And now I've gone off so far away
A castaway
