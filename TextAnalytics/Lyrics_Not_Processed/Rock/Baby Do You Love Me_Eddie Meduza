The show is done and the curtain's coming down
And I can see there's no use to hang around
Is this the way you prefer to do your show?
If that's the way it is I think I really have to go

I slow my steps and I start to hesitate
And keep on thinking "It's maybe not to late"
To rearrange and do something that is new
Where I would be the hero and the second part is you
So tell me what it's gonna be cause I don't have a clue

Baby, do you love me?
I wanna know
Are you gonna leave me, are you gonna love me?
Baby if you leave me, please let it show
If you gonna leave me do let me know

You never said that you loved somebody else
And still you say you will leave me on the shelf
I can't believe that you meaning what you say
Could such a lovely girl as you've been treating me this way?
So tell me how it's gonna before I fade away

Baby, do you love me?
I wanna know
Are you gonna leave me, are you gonna love me?
Baby if you leave me, please let it show
If you gonna leave me do let me know

The game is over and the curtain's coming down
And there is nobody but you're hanging around
In just a little while I know you will be gone
So don't you tell me baby that the show must carry on

Baby, do you love me?
Are you gonna leave me, are you gonna love me?
Baby, if you need me
If you gonna leave me do let me know

Baby, do you love me?
I wanna know
Are you gonna leave me, are you gonna love me?
Baby if you leave me, please let it show
If you gonna leave me do let me know

Baby, do you love me?
I wanna know
Are you gonna leave me, are you gonna love me?
Baby if you leave me, please let it show
If you gonna leave me do let me know

Baby, do you love me?

Baby, do you love me?

Baby, do you love me?
