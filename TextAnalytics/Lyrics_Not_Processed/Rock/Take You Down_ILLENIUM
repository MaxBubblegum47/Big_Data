[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to hurt you when I hurt myself
It's just an empty voice screaming out for help
No, I didn't mean to scare you, but I couldn't see
That when I went to hell, I was taking you with me

[Chorus 1]
When I close my eyes
I'm climbing in the dark
Trying not to fall apart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don't wanna take you down with me

[Pre-Drop]
You're the love in my heart, only love in my heart
Take you down, take you down with me
Don't wanna take you down, take you down
Take you down with me

[Drop]
Take you down with me
Take you down with me
(You're the love in my heart, only love in my heart)
(Take you down)

[Verse 2]
This life is like a razor
When it cuts, I bleed
But it's in my hand, and I'm doing it to me
Sometimes it's like an ocean
And it gets too deep
And there's no way that now you could rescue me

[Chorus 2]
When I close my eyes
I'm fighting in the dark
Trying not to break your heart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don't wanna take you down with me

[Bridge]
You need to let it go now
Before you drown
I know that you won't understand
But you need to let go of these hands
'Cause I'm going down
And I don't wanna take you down with me

[Drop]
I don't wanna take you down with me
Take you down, down with me
