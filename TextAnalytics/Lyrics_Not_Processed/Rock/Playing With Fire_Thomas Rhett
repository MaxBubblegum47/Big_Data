[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
I know I should let it go
Take a different road
When I'm driving home
But I don't want to
Delete your number from my phone
Instead of calling
Asking if you're all alone
But I don't want to

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
Stay away
From your side of town
But it's too late
I'm in your drive right now

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher
But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire

[Verse 2: Jordin Sparks]
Ooh
I could find a spot to go hang out on Friday night
Where you are gonna be
But I don't want to, no
Yeah, I could let it end
Call it quits, call off all this on and off again
But I just don't want to

[Pre-Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
Yeah, that key
Is right under the mat
Come on in
Baby, let's strike that match

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Jordin Sparks]
I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher
But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire
Playing with fire

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett & (Jordin Sparks)]
So let's fire it up one more time (Fire it up one more time)
Baby, just put your lips on mine (Lips on mine)

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & (Jordin Sparks)]
I don't know, why I don't
Put it out, baby
We kiss and the flames just get higher
(We kiss and the flames just get higher)
But yeah, I know
When I hold onto you, baby (Onto you, baby)
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire (All tangled up)
(I'm all tangled up)
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time (Give it time)
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy (Sounds crazy)
But guess I like playing with fire (Playing with fire)
Playing with fire
(Playing with fire)

[Outro: Jordin Sparks]
Playing with fire, huh
