[Verse 1]
Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'll leave you when the summertime
Leave you when the summer comes a-rolling
Leave you when the summer comes along

[Verse 2]
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby, baby
I wanna leave you
I ain't joking woman, I've got to ramble
Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I believin'
We really got to ramble (I can hear it calling me)
I can hear it calling me the way it used to do
I can hear it calling me back home

[Bridge 1]
Babe, I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby, you know, I've really got to leave you
Oh I can hear it calling me
I said don't you hear it calling me the way it used to do?

[Verse 3]
I know I know, I know
I never, never, never, never, never gonna leave you, babe
But I got to go away from this place
I've got to quit you, yeah
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oh, don't you hear it callin' me?
Oh, woman, woman, I know, I know
It feels good to have you back again
And I know that one day baby, it's gonna really grow, yes it is
We gonna go walkin' through the park every day
Come what may, every day, oh
My, my, my, my, my, my babe
I'm gonna leave you, go away

[Bridge 2]
Oh, I miss you, baby
It was really, really good
You made me happy every single day
But now I've got to go away
Oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
That's when it's calling me
I said that's when it's calling me back home
