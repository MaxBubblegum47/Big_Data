You stand there on your soapbox without fear
Like a chanting wild demented auctioneer
It's just a bunch of crap, ha, you're talking out your hat
And, I don't want you chewing off my ear
(No need to shout)
I'm hearing what you say
(No need to shout)
Just shut your mouth and go away
You preach to the converted, it's insane
We're here already swinging like a train
I can only hope that you won't ram it down my throat
Don't make me swallow it again
(No need to shout)
Alright, I'm hearing what you say
(No need to shout)
No, no, just shut your mouth and go away
Your manifesto, stuffed inside your suitcase
Blah blah blah, you're never wrong
And even when you're stooping, tying up your shoelace
You keep droning on and on and on and on
Ha, I got your message loud and clear
The meaningless is ringing in my ear
Oh, what a bunch of trash you got exuding from your ass
That's not the shit I wanna hear
(No need to shout)
No need to shout, man
I'm hearing what you say
(No need to shout)
No, no, wrap it up
On your way
(No need to shout)
Woo-hoo-hoo
(No need to shout)
No, no, just shut your mouth and go away
