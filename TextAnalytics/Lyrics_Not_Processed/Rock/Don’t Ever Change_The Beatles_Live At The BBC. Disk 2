[Verse 1]
You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans except on Sunday
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
I kind of like you just the way you are

[Verse 2]
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tom-boy
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to to be
As sweet as you are

[Verse 3]
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue
I love you when you're mad at me
So how can I get tired of you
A lots of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to to be
As sweet as you are

[Outro]
Please don't ever change
Don't you ever change
Please don't ever change
Don't you ever change (fade out)
