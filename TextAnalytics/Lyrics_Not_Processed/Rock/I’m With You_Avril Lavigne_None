[Intro]
You, I'm with you

[Verse 1]
I'm standing on a bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening but there's no sound

[Chorus]
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me
Won't someone take me home
It's a damn cold night
Tryna' figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you

[Verse 2]
I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is anybody here I know
Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no-one likes to be alone

[Chorus]
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me
Won't someone take me home
It's a damn cold night
Tryna' figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you

[Bridge]
Oh why is everything so confusing
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Tryna' figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
Why is everything so confusing (I'm with you)
Maybe I'm just out of my mind (I'm with you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I'm with you)
