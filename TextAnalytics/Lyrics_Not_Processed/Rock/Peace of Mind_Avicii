[Verse]
Dear society
You are moving way too fast
Way too fast for me
I'm just tryin' to catch my breath

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I get a little peace of mind?
And a little bit of silence to unwind?

[Chorus]
Relief, do you need a relief?
Do you need a relief? Do you need a release?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be–
Can I get a little peace of mind?

[Verse]
Dear society
You are moving way too fast
Way too fast for me
I'm just tryin' to catch my breath

[Chorus]
Relief, do you need a relief?
Do you need a relief? Do you need a release?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be–
Do you wanna let, let go? Do you wanna let go?
Do you wanna let go? Do you wanna let go?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be–
Can I get a little peace of mind?
And a little bit of silence to unwind?

[Verse]
Dear society
You are moving way too fast
Way too fast for me
I'm just tryna to catch my breath

[Chorus]
Relief, do you need a relief?
Do you need a relief? Do you need a release?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be–
Do you wanna let, let go? Do you wanna let go?
Do you wanna let go? Do you wanna let go?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna let–

[Outro]
Can I get a little peace of mind?
