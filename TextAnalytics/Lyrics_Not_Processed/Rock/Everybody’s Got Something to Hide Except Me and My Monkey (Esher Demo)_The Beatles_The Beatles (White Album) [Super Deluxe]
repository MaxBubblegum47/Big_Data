Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, it's such a joy
Come on, it's such a joy
Come on, take it easy

Everybody's got something to hide
Except for me and my monkey

The deeper you go, the higher you fly
The higher you fly, the deeper you go

So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, it's such a joy

Your inside is out, and your outside is in
Your outside is in, and your inside is out
