[Refrain 1]
Atlas said he's dropping the world tonight
Think we deserve a couple of days
People wanting diamonds and pearls in life
I guess he couldn't handle the weight
Who do you run to when the world beneath is gone?
'Cause there's plenty good homes for the wicked here
And money does grow on trees
And the people looking up for the answers here
When the truth is lying at your feet
All that's here is you and me

[Verse 1]
Michelangelo did the Sistine
2Pac is living down in South Jamaica
When I'm gone, I know you gon' miss me
They like how you gon' say that, 'for you even make it
How you gon' dream so fuckin big?
Who're you? The fuckin' savior!
You need a lover or a hater, either one could tame ya
You need some hard time in a school
You need some pharmaceuticals
You need somebody who ain't you to come swoop and save ya
I need that fuckin bass up
I need that James Blake up
I'm out here singing like a rooster, I hope someone wakes up
I need some earmuffs when I hear you say "Go get that paper"
I'ma get it anyway but I ain't tryna hear that
I don't do them cliches
I don't do them replays
We don't do what you do
'Cause you follow what we say

[Refrain 2]
Atlas said he's dropping the world tonight
Think we deserve a couple of days
People wanting diamonds and pearls in life
I guess he couldn't handle the weight
Who do you run to when the world beneath is gone?
'Cause there's plenty good homes for the wicked here
And money does grow on trees
And the people looking up for the answers here
When the truth is lying at your feet
But as soon as that sky has fallen
I'll be the first to drop down to my knees
And see if there's something more than you and me

[Verse 2]
There's people running to they loved ones
The freeways packed with empty cars
There's people crowding in the churches
But they ain't as crowded as the bars
I found my hope inside this music shit
I'm on a hill just writing bars
I think it's crazy I'm not losing it
I ain't looked once up at the stars

[Bridge]
Have no fear, no fear
Still here, still here
No fear, no fear
Still here, still here
(x3)

[Verse 3]
Dear God we're full of size
Give us another sun
Maybe we'll hear it over all these drunken lullabies
I burned my cash this morning
Nothing but rap this morning
I even posted on the 'gram so I can act important
No one left to honor us
Can't check who the designer was
Looking cold as hell but all that ice is shining, blinding us
We the ones that lie to us
The shallow man is gone
Say he was draped up in Versace when that nigga died alone
