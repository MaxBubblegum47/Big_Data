[Chorus]
No surrender
No surrender

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
My nigga just handle your business, so can I get a witness?
Can you duck? Fuck the po-po, pow
Startin' to kick this, gonna get my shit, and then get you fucked up
Me buck. Me bang. Niggas ain't talkin' 'bout them thangs
Thugs remain, hang, swang with a click tight clan
Come again, now they drop down when I'm off the block fuck them cops
Me and Krayzie runnin' through the Boneyard, daily
Gotta give 'em up to the Glock-Glock
So I can serve me thugs and maintain
To the brain, and thugs remain to slang thangs
Long live the dope game, and it won't end ya
As long as my niggas remember: no pretender
Get right up off St. Clair, nigga, Fuck it. No surrender

[Chorus]
No surrender
No surrender

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Not wantin' the copper to hit me a lick up
Found me a victim to stick up, pick up
Rollin' the nine-ball,slippin'
That's why me trippin'
Bloody victim
Get him when the time calls, dog
Straight two-eleven, bailin', thuggin'on these niggas well
Then Bone's fuckin' with the hoes
Here comes them po-pos
Nigga, that pig done peeped me, me gots to flees and get my creep on
Bone get gone, hit a wrong turn, mash the gas, and dash on
Jump outta the hottie, move me body
Hittin' them cuts and trails, runnin' like we lunatics
Gotta make it back to Hazeldell
Escape and eludin' the chase
Buckin' me gauge, so nigga, remember:
Me killa, me no surrender
Me killa, me killa, me killa

[Chorus]
No surrender
No surrender

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
Puttin' me on my knees, tellin' me move and I'm dead
Cause I'm killin' all you bitches, turnin' them blue suits red
And then I'm comin' to that funeral to shoot that bitch up
Because I know that's where y'all bitches is bound to meet up
Cop killas, all up in they chest, and
I know what to do with that vest, man
Twenty-two shots. I killa
You don't wanna fuck with Bone, nigga
And it really ain't shit to pull a trigger on a copper
Cause if I go down, some of y'all goin' down
Cause I'm goin' down poppin', so motherfuck all coppers
Let me catch you slippin', nigga, bet I pop ya
Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop
Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop

[Verse 4: Krayzie Bone]
Ya better believe it's judgement day
So, nigga, just throw your pumps up in the air
Now kill 'em, kill 'em copper, like ya just don't care
When they come, they come creepin'
Me peepin'
Gotta watch them po-pos sleepin'
Put 'em in deep in gutters. Me keepin'
'til a me rich and gotta get mine, everytime
This'll be over in 9-9
So, nigga, get down for the crime
Gonna be more coppers dyin' in the line
Fuckin' with thugs
When I be slangin' my drugs
Tryin' to cuff me and my nigga boy, gotta rip them guts
And lay your head in blood
Better check yourself next time you test and try to smoke a nigga
Bitch, remember: me killa. Me no surrender
Me no surrender. Nigga, me no surrender
Me no surrender. Don't make me put one in ya
Me no surrender. Don't make me put one in ya
Me no surrender

[Chorus]
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender
No surrender
