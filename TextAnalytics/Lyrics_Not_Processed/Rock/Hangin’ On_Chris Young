[Verse 1]
I'm a few drinks in, but that ain't the reason
I'm all tongue-tied and my breath's leaving this fast
I can't get past
Those blue eyes shining
They keep drawing me in to you
Got me fallin' off track
You get me like that

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me

[Verse 2]
It ain't the song, and it ain't the playlist
It's every smile coming off of your sweet lips, yeah
That makes me wanna stay here
No, this ain't a one night, one time thing
You always light me up like a flame and it's clear
Every time you're near

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me
Yeah, you hangin' on to me

[Bridge]
So let me pull you a little closer
Even when the music's over

[Chorus]
I'll be hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me
Yeah, you hangin' on to me
