[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
You better watch what you say
You better watch what you do to me
Don't get carried away
Girl, if you can do better than me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go
Yeah, go
But remember

[Chorus]
Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe
When I found you

[Verse 2]
You put a hand on my cheek
And then you turned your eyes away
If you don't feel complete
If I don't take you all of the way

[Pre-Chorus]
Then go
Yeah, go
But remember

[Chorus]
Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe
When I found you

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, go
Just go
But remember

[Chorus]
Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe
When I found you
