[Verse 1]
Late night train back to of Austin
Couple cars, cocaine, and the interstate
Most every night this is what it's like
You don't answer I keep callin' just to stay awake

[Chorus]
Hope what you said wasn't meant for me
You told me I was no good
It's alright, babe I'm pretty used to being misunderstood

[Verse 2]
I never pegged you for what you are
Had it in my head I would break your heart
I hate to think about what I did
Some things in me are broke I can't find a fix

[Chorus]
Hope what you said wasn't meant for me
You told me I was no good
It's alright, babe I'm pretty used to bein' misunderstood
It's alright, babe I'm pretty used to bein' misunderstood

[Verse 3]
Go home and sleep 'til I leave again
That's why I gave you up, couldn't watch you cry
You said you'd wait on me patiently
But I live out of a bag 'til the day I die

[Chorus]
I guess I get how you think of me
You told me I was no good
It's alright, babe I'm pretty used to bein' misunderstood
It's alright, babe I'm pretty used to bein' misunderstood
It's alright, babe I'm pretty used to bein' misunderstood
