[Chorus]
Girl I told you what it was, I let you know
I kept it all the way real, 'cause I been here before
I gave you every chance for you to let it go
I'm too busy living life and fuckin' hoes
Yeah, but I know I treat you so good
And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood

[Verse 1]
Tryna figure out what you tweaking for
Everything was all good just a week ago
Now you tryna act like I'm creeping though
Told you I had hoes, but you must ain't believed me though
Questions, like why I don't answer my phone
Shawty, you tripping, I'm busy, you always wanna fuck up my zone
Texting me paragraphs and textbooks, girl just leave me alone
You ain't my mom or my PO, ain't got to answer you, I'm grown

[Pre-Chorus]
But shit been getting real now
I'm just tryna tell you how I feel now
I'mma be the same, shawty, I probably won't change for a while
But I just wanna know is you still down?

[Chorus]
Girl I told you what it was, I let you know
I kept it all the way real, 'cause I been here before
I gave you every chance for you to let it go
I'm too busy living life and fuckin' hoes
Yeah, but I know I treat you so good
And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood

[Verse 2]
I been touching hoes the same way that I touch you
Fucking hoes the same way that I fuck you
Treating hoes the same way, but I trust you
I don't love you, but I love you
Do you get it? Do you get it?
This here's something different
What we share is something different
I don't care girl, I'm different
I ain't like these other niggas
I don't care if you was strippin'
Throw it back girl, I'm tippin'
I can't lie girl, I miss it

[Pre-Chorus]
But shit been getting real now
I'm just tryna tell you how I feel now
I'mma be the same, shawty, I probably won't change for a while
But I just wanna know is you still down?

[Hook]
'Cause I told you what it was, I let you know
I kept it all the way real, 'cause I been here before
I gave you every chance for you to let it go
I'm too busy living life and fuckin' hoes
Yeah, but I know I treat you so good
And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood

[Spoken Skit]

[Chorus]
Girl I told you what it was, I let you know
I kept it all the way real, 'cause I been here before
I gave you every chance for you to let it go
I'm too busy living life and fuckin' hoes
Yeah, but I know I treat you so good
And I know I eat you so good
And I know it's hard to find a nigga like me 'cause I keep it so hood
And I ain't into breaking hearts, I swear I would take it all back if I could
Let's get this understood, right now we're misunderstood
