This is the third night in a row
We've been cruising the town
Windows down, singing songs
Just driving around
My buddies think I'm crazy
Hell, I might be maybe
But that's okay baby
What you say?

Come fall into me, into my arms
Let me wrap you up with this southern boy charm
Hey bay, what you say?
Girl you got a way
Of making me want to take the long way home
While we were hugging and kissing, getting the loving turned on
I need you bad you see
The things you do to me
If you're feeling what I'm feeling hop on out of that shotgun seat
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me

Give me a shot of them sweet pink lemonade lips
That's it, don't quit
Girl it's right on hit [?]
You could be my country dime
I wanna make you mine
You're so fine, I ain't lyin'
Don't you think it's time to

Fall into me, into my arms
Let me wrap you up with this southern boy charm
Hey bay, what you say?
Girl you got a way
Of making me want to take the long way home
While we were hugging and kissing, getting the loving turned on
I need you bad you see
The things you do to me
If you're feeling what I'm feeling hop on out of that shotgun seat
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me

Fall into me, into my arms
Let me wrap you up with this southern boy charm
Hey bay, what you say?
Girl you got a way
Of making me want to take the long way home
While we were hugging and kissing, getting the loving turned on
I need you bad you see
The things you do to me
If you're feeling what I'm feeling hop on out of that shotgun seat
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me

You could be my country dime
I wanna make you mine
You're so fine, I ain't lyin'
Baby don't you think it's time
To lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Baby lay it on me
