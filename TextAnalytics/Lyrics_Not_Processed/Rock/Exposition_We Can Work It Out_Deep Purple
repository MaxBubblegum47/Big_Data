[Verse 1]
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing
That our love will soon be gone

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 2]
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong
And still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out
And get it straight or say goodnight

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Bridge]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
I'll ask you once again

[Verse 3]
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While I see it your way
There's a chance that we might
Fall apart before too long

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Bridge]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
I'll ask you once again

[Verse 4]
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell
If I am right or I am wrong
While I see it your way
There's a chance that we might
Fall apart before too long

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Outro]
At least we can try
We can try to work it out someday
