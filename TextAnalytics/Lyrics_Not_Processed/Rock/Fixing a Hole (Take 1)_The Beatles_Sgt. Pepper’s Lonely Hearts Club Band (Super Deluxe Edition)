[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 2]
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Bridge 1]
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Silly people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 3]
I'm painting a room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh ooh ooh aah aah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey

[Bridge 1]
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Silly people runnin' round
They worry me and never ask me why they don't get past my door

[Verse 4]
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh ooh ooh aah aah

[Outro]
Fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go, oh
Where it will go, oh
Fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go, oh
