[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out, now

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She was a day tripper
A one way ticket, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there
She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there, now

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She was a day tripper
A one way ticket, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Guitar Solo: John Lennon]

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She was a day tripper
A Sunday driver, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
Day tripper
