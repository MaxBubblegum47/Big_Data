[Chorus]
Ayy, God told me we gon' make it out eventually
Standin' tall but it's been fucking with me mentally
These streets cold, niggas smoke you like a chimney
But pain is temporary, I ain't trippin', it ain't shit to me

[Verse 1]
God kept me, I'm woke, I got a purpose
I'm a victim of two murders, this shit got me feelin' worthless
We was drivin' hella fast, I woke up seeing nurses
Happened in a second, mind spinnin' like a circus, nigga
I'm in the back seat, how the fuck it's my fault?
November 29th, almost died up on that asphalt
Bro switched up, throwin' shade like a fast ball
I pray for better days, keep my faith, I'ma stand tall
They like Hayden you fell off, I'm like hell nah
Tryna keep me in this bed, I'm like hell nah
Love my brothers, bro we tighter than a dreadlock
Promise to be rich but for now we down as bedrock
Rest in peace to that family in that casket
And I mean it when I say I ain't want this shit to happen
I done had a wake up call so for now I'm stuck to rappin'
Rest in peace to Noggy, for your love I'll make you happy

[Chorus]
God told me we gon' make it out eventually
Standin' tall but it's been fucking with me mentally
These streets cold, niggas smoke you like a chimney
But pain is temporary, I ain't trippin', it ain't shit to me
God told me we gon' make it out eventually
Standin' tall but it's been fucking with me mentally
These streets cold, niggas smoke you like a chimney
But pain is temporary, I ain't trippin', it ain't shit to me

[Verse 2]
Look, burst knuckles,  morphine in my IV and shit
And with this bag on my stomach, nothin' spicy and shit
I'm moving slowly to the top, being silenced and shit
I swear to God I love this music, bro I'm dyin' for this
I'm in this situation but God know I'ma make it through
I woke up in a bed and there was nothing I could do
They say they feel my pain but they can't even wear my shoes
Six days with no drink, six days with no food, huh

[Outro]
God told me we gon' make it out eventually
Standin' tall but it's been fucking with me mentally
These streets cold, niggas smoke you like a chimney
But pain is temporary, I ain't trippin', it ain't shit to me
