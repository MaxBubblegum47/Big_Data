One hot angel
One cool devil

Give it all, give it
Give it what you got
Come on give it all a lot
Pick it up move it
Give it to the spot
Your mind on fantasy
Living on ecstasy

Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)
Yeah the Runaway Train

Old school rebel
A ten for the revelry
Diamond of the agency
Shake it, Shake it

Get it on, get it up
Come on give it all you got
Your mind on fantasy
Living on the ecstasy




[Chorus]
Runaway Train

Yeah the Runaway Train

[Verse 3]
One hot southern belle
Son of a devil
A school boy spelling bee
A school girl with a fantasy
One hot rang a ale
Old school rebel
A ten for the revelry
Diamond of the agency
Shake it, Shake it
Take it to the spot
You know she make it really hot
Get it on, get it up
Come on give it what you got
You know she’s just like a




[Chorus]
Runaway Train
