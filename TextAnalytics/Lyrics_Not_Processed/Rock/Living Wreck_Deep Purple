[Verse 1]
You came along for a weekend
But you only stayed for one night
You took off your hair
You pulled out your teeth
Oh I almost died of fright

[Chorus]
You'd better do something for your own sake
Yes it's a shame
Ah you know you're a living wreck

[Verse 2]
You said you were a virgin
Full of promise and mystery
But I knew that you
Would bring me down
Because everyone calls you big G

[Chorus]
