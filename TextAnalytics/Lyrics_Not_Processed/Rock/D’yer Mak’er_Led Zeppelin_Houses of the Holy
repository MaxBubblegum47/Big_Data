[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
All those tears I cry, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
All those tears I cry, oh, oh, oh, ay, ay
Baby, please don't go

[Chorus]
When I read the letter you wrote me, it made me mad, mad, mad
When I read the words that it told me, it made me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so, I can't let you go
I love you, ooh, baby, I love you

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Every breath I take oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, every move I make
Oh, baby, please don't go, oh
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
You hurt me to my soul, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You hurt me to my soul, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Darling, please don't go

[Chorus]
When I read the letter you sent me, it made me mad, mad, mad
When I read the news that it broke, it made me sad, sad, sad
But I still love you so, and I can't let you go
I love you, ooh baby, I love you

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh
