[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's right
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
Oh no, no, oh no! Oh no
Yeah, yeah! I've got a feeling, yeah!

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Oh please, believe me, I'd hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah!
And if you leave me I won't be late again
Oh no, oh no! Oh no
Yeah, yeah! I've got a feeling, yeah!
I've got a feeling

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody who looked like you!

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah (oh yeah!)
I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah! Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah! I've got a feeling, yeah!
Yeah

[Verse 4: John Lennon and (Paul McCartney)]
Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
Everybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, (oh yeah) oh yeah, oh yeah (yeah)

[Verse 5: John Lennon and (Paul McCartney)]
Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up (yeah)
Everybody put their foot down, oh yeah

[Verse 6: Paul McCartney and (John Lennon)]
Yeah, woo-hoo!
I've got a feeling (Everybody had a good year)
A feeling deep inside (Everybody had a hard time)
Oh yeah (Everybody had a wet dream)
Oh yeah (Everybody saw the sunshine)
I've got a feeling (Everybody had a good year)
A feeling I can't hide (Everybody let their hair down)
Oh no (Everybody pulled their socks up)
Oh no, no (Everybody put their foot down, oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah!

[Outro: Paul McCartney and (John Lennon) ]
I've got a feeling (Oh yeah)
I've got a feeling (Oh yeah)
I've got a feeling
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Oh my soul, so hard.)
