[Verse 1]
I was burned in the heat of the moment
Though it couldn't been the heat of the day
When I learned how my time had been wasted
Tear fell as I turned away

[Verse 2]
Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder
When I should happen to fall
Time and his bride growing older
I've got friends who will give me fuck all

[Hook]
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

[Verse 3]
Corner of Bleecker and nowhere
In the land of not quite day
A shiver runs down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey

[Verse 4]
So looked round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away

[Hook]
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

[Verse 5]
As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay

[Verse 6]
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward

[Hook]
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, now do it

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 7]
Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise

[Verse 8]
Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground, don't be messing around
Or you'll land in a boat without oars

[Hook]
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala, my baby
Lalalalalalalala, yeah
Lalalalalalalala

[Outro]
Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe
I lost my way
Hey babe, hey babe
I really really do now
Hey babe, hey babe
I don't know where I'm going to find it
Hey babe, hey babe
Do you want to know
Do you really, really, want to help me, yeah?
Let me tell you now, babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right
Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right
Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so, feels so, feels so good
