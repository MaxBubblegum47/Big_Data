[Verse 1]
Love bomb, love bomber
It's a-comin' on strong
I can't take it any longer
Come a-rockin' through your door

[Pre-Chorus]
Cruisin' the sky, let's fly
Blowin' all night and day
Open your bays, get ready, it's bombs away

[Verse 2]
Love bomb, love bomber
Don't scare, no bother
Where the size doesn't matter
Come long, short or batter

[Pre-Chorus]
Cruisin' the sky, let's fly
Blowin' all night and day
Open your bays and drop those bombs away

[Chorus]
Love bomb, comin' on
Love bomb
Love bomb, get it hard
Love bomb

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Love bomb, get it on
Love bomb, gettin' stoned
Love bomb, get it hot
Love bomb, yeah-yeah, yow
Love bomb, I'm comin' on
Love bomb, I'm gettin' stoned
Love bomb, get it hot
Love bomb, yeah
Love bomb, love bomber
Love bomb, love bomber
Love bomb, love bomber
Love bomb, love bomber
