[Intro]
Alright
Hey there, all you middle men
Throw away your fancy clothes
And while you're out there, sittin' on the fence
So, get off your ass and come down here
'Cause rock and roll ain't no riddle, man
To me, it makes good, good sense
Good sense, just go
Ow
Ooh, yes

[Verse 1]
Heavy decibels are playing on my guitar
We got vibrations comin' up from the floor
We're just listenin' to the rockers givin' too much noise
Are you deaf, you wanna hear some more?

[Pre-Chorus]
We're just talking about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die
Never gonna die

[Chorus]
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll, it will survive
Yes it will, ha ha

[Verse 2]
I took a look inside your bedroom door
You looked so good lyin' on your bed
Well, I asked you if you wanted any rhythm and love
You said you wanna rock and roll, instead

[Pre-Chorus]
We're just talking about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die
Never gonna die

[Chorus]
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't no pollution
Rock and roll is just rock and roll

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't no pollution
Rock and rollin' will survive
Rock and roll ain't no pollution
Rock and roll it'll never die
Rock and roll ain't no pollution
Rock and roll
Ah, rock and roll
Is just rock and roll, yeah
