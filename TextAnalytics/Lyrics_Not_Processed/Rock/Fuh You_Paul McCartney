[Verse 1]
Come on baby now, let me look at you
Talking 'bout yourself, try to tell the truth
I could stay up half the night, trying to crack your code
I could stay up half the night, but I'd rather hit the road

[Pre-Chorus]
On the night that I met you, I was on the town
On the night that I met you

[Chorus]
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you

[Verse 2]
Come on baby now, help me work it out
I won't let you down so you don't need to shout
I could stay up half the night, playing with your head
I could stay up half the night, but I'd rather go to bed

[Pre-Chorus]
On the night that I met you, I was on the town
On the night that I met you

[Chorus]
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you

[Bridge]
And everyday, in every way
And everyday, in every way

[Chorus]
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you, I just want it fuh you
I just wanna know how you feel
Want a love that's so proud and real
You make me wanna go out and steal
I just want it fuh you
