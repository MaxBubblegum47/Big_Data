[Verse 1]
I’ve been watching you dancing all night long
Your legs go on forever
Exquisite synchronicity, they never stayed together
My head’s spinning, keeping focused on my mind and building this
I don’t know who you are but I’m enslaved to make your service

[Chorus]
Makes you fall in line
A moving silhouette
It’s your body line
You do that thing you read
Make you fall in line
Clearly defined
It’s your body line
A perfect outline, so divine

[Verse 2]
Chilling to half it must’ve been hazy
Smoking my eye a poppin
Fight for your country, you got something to gain
No one but Mike Jones driving
Girl come in and out, my excuse to get me is in danger
No will but that’s like just emptied it
Wouldn’t want to be disillusion

[Chorus]
Makes you fall in line
So heavenly ashamed
It’s your body line
My oh my, oh my, oh my
Make you fall in line
A perfect outline, so divine
Body line

[Verse 3]
When we’re moving, connection
Well bring me to the main view
It seems to want distraction
But what I need

[Chorus]
