[Verse 1]
Well
Oh baby baby, don't you want a man like me?
Oh baby baby, I'm just as sweet as anybody could be
Oh baby baby, I want to look to your eyes of blue
Oh baby baby, it's more than anybody else could do

[Verse 2]
Well
Oh baby baby, you know when I see you walking down the street
Oh baby baby, well you looking good enough to eat
Oh baby baby, I don't believe I've tasted this before
Oh baby baby, I want it now and every mouthful more of you

[Hook]
Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you

[Verse 3]
Oh baby baby, you know that I wanted it more
Oh baby baby, I'm about to kiss goodbye to this store
Oh baby baby, it ain't the wrapping that sells the goods
Oh baby baby, I got a sweet tooth when my mouth is full of you

[Hook]
Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you
Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, oh
Baby it's alright, it's alright
Ooh
Baby it's alright, it's alright

[Verse 4]
Well
Oh baby, baby, oh you sting like a bee
Oh baby, baby, I like your honey and it sure likes me
Oh baby, baby, I got my spoon inside your jar
Oh baby, baby, don't give me too much, don't make me starve

[Verse 5]
Oh baby, baby, sugar sister on a silver plate
Oh baby, baby, I need a mouthful and I just can't wait
Oh baby, baby, see the shaking in my hand
Oh baby, baby, don't mean to fumble but it tastes so grand
Tastes so grand, tastes so grand
Tastes so grand, tastes so grand

[Chorus]
Ooh
Baby it's alright, oh it's alright
Ooh
Baby it's alright, oh it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, oh it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, yeah it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, it's alright
Ooh, ooh
It's alright, it's alright
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
It's alright, it's alright
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Alright
