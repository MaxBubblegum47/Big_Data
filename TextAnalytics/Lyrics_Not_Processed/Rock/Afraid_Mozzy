[Verse 1: Mozzy]
I was pourin' until it ran out, type of nigga got his hand out
My youngin' thirsty for a man down, youngin' thirsty for a man down
Unless I tell that lil nigga, 'Stand down,' that's a murder, yeah
He tryna swap out his burner, yeah, I'm tryna help him get further
Yeah, lately been doin' these numbers
Workin' and workin', you know I deserve it
Yeah, my future was never for certain
We had to use dish liquid for detergent
Yeah, pop a whole lot of perkys
Yeah, still idolize David A Perkins
Yeah, make it drizzle while she twerkin'
Gang tatted on the bitch in cursive
Word, first one out there on the first
Word, keep a bundle on my person
Word, keep a thumper on my person
Nigga say the scale tweakin' tryna work us
Yeah, I got a mean rep, I had to earn it
Niggas really puttin' work for this surface
Got a mean rep, I had to earn it
Four finger bangin', bitch this the murders
Nigga really puttin' work for this surface

[Chorus: DCMBR]
I do or die for this shit
I flooded all my chains because they want me in the grave, they don't want me rich
Did it all with my wrist
I did it all by breakin' down and weighin' up and servin' all who need a fix
I ain't afraid, I ain't afraid
How far we came to live this way, my goons we straight
I ain't afraid, I ain't afraid, to die today 'cause I made my way
I stayed the same, can't never change, won't ever change
No

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
You know I ran out of dope, finna cook some more
Hoe broke as shit, she ain't put me on
Dirty ass black hoodie, put it on
And you know exactly who we lookin' for
Couldn't find him so he finna live some more
I was takin' trips, why you wouldn't go?
Kicked a 100 doors, how you end up broke?
Ya I fucked your bitch, I ain't kiss her though
Fuck with Akhiana, shit we trippin' though
Fuck you bitchin' for? Shut up listen hoe
I love you niggas, I let all the shooters know
Make no mistake, it's who I do it for
10k or better just to do a show
And I keep it cloudy in the coupe alone
And I'm liable to slither through alone
When you God's child, you can move alone
Do it three way for my little bro
When this bitch answer, I'ma mute the phone
Drug dealer dreams we was movin' zones
Nerves bad baby, I can barely roll
Damn Nem, can't believe you niggas gone
Damn Perk, can't believe you niggas gone
Damn Zoe, can't believe you niggas gone
Damn Deezy, can't believe you niggas gone

[Chorus: DCMBR]
I do or die for this shit
I flooded all my chains because they want me in the grave, they don't want me rich
Did it all with my wrist
I did it all by breakin' down and weighin' up and servin' all who need a fix
I ain't afraid, I ain't afraid
How far we came to live this way, my goons we straight
I ain't afraid, I ain't afraid to die today cause I made my way
I stayed the same, can't never change, won't ever change
No

[Outro: Mozzy]
Do or die for this shit
Suicidal we shoot up the ride
Nigga fire off the whole clip
Do or die for this shit
Yeah, suicidal we shoot up the ride
Nigga fire off the whole clip
