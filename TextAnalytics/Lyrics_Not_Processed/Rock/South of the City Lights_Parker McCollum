[Verse 1]
I've been learning how to do it all the hard way
Saving up, burning up my yesterdays
Trying so hard not to believe
Take a bite of the lies that you've been feeding me

[Chorus]
Tell me something that I don't know, leave me with those eyes
I'll be right here waiting south of the city lights

[Verse 2]
Wish I would've listen' to my brother when he told me
Loving her is only gonna leave you lonely
Don't believe in fate, careful who you love
They don't care out there where you're coming from

[Chorus]
Tell me something that I don't know, leave me with those eyes
I'll be right here waiting south of the city lights

[Verse 3]
It's been a long time coming to finding out that I don't know it all
It's always good when you get it, don't take too long till you wanna go

[Verse 4]
Now I'll just sit and stare at white walls all the time
Wish you would somehow hear that I ain't doing fine
I'll never be the same, I'll never love again
I'll never leave this mess that I've been living in

[Chorus]
Tell me something that I don't know, leave me with those eyes
I'll be waiting right here south of the city lights
South of the city lights, south of the city lights
