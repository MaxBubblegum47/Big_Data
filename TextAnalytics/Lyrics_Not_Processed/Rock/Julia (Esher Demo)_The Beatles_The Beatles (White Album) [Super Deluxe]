[Intro]
Hello, Paul! (Hello!)
(Okay)
Maybe you could turn the level of this mic down a little

[Verse 1]
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you
Julia

[Chorus]
Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

[Bridge]
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun

[Chorus]
Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

[Outro]
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia
Julia
Julia

[Whistling]
Okay
