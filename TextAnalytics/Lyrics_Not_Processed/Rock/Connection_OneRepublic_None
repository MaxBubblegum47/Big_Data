[Verse 1]
These days my waves get lost in the oceans
Seven billion swimmers, man I'm going through the motions
Sent up a flare, I need love and devotion
Traded for some faces that I never know, notion
Maybe I should try to find the old me
Take me to the places and the people that know me
Tryna just connect, thinking maybe you could show me
If there's so many people here, then why am I so lonely?

[Chorus 1]
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

[Verse 2]
Real friends, good friends â€“ hard to find, let's face it
Buy the perfect home and there's a flood in the basement
Made a couple dollars now, and I ain't tryna chase it
Kids from Oklahoma, man, we don't waste it
I'm just tryna paint the picture for me
Something I could give a damn about in maybe 40
Years and I be ready and willing and able to edit the story
Cause there's so many people here to be so damn lonely

[Chorus 2]
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

[Refrain]
Lonely

[Bridge]
Right now, right now, I'm switching to a new lane
Foot to the floor, man searching for the real thing
Need somebody else, sometimes ain't no shame
Head to the clouds sayin'

[Chorus 3]
It's like can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

[Outro]
Uh
Tryna find the old me (Lonely)
Yeah
