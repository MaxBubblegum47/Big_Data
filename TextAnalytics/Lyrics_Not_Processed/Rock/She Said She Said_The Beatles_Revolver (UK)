[Verse 1]
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

[Verse 2]
I said, "who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Bridge]
She said, "you don't understand what I've said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

[Verse 3]
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Bridge]
She said, "you don't understand what I said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

[Verse 4]
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Outro]
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it's like to be dead"
