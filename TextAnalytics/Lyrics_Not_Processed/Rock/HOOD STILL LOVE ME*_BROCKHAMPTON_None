Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
One, two, three, and, and

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't care if you there when I leave
When I'm gone, tag along, we both weak
I don't care, don't take my money
Take my money, the hood still love me
I don't care if you there (I don't care if you there) when I leave
When I'm gone, tag along (When I'm gone, tag along), we both weak
I don't care (I don't care if you–), don't take my money (I don't care)
Take my money (I don't care if you–), the hood still love me (I don't care)
(I don't care if you there)
