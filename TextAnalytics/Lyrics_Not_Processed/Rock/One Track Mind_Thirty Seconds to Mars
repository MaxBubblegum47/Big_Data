[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Love is like problems, we all got 'em

[Verse 1: Jared Leto]
A dark night, remember, the sunrise, surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way
Hands tied, remember, it's suicide to surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
I have a one-track mind, I have a one track-mind
There is a method to the madness, to the madness
Gotta have a one-track mind, ooh

[Verse 2: Jared Leto]
Sex and lies, remember, look in my eyes, surrender
There isn't any other way, there isn't any other way
Outta luck, outta time, outta sight, I'm outta mind, mind

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
I have a one-track mind, I have a one-track mind
There is a method to the madness, to the madness
Gotta have a one-track mind, ooh

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Float around town, made it official now
Think about you every now and again
There's been times, spendin days when I'm with you, girl
On my downtime, locking in, I take a ride around downtown
I'm not in the right town, come alive in the nighttime
Wasn't the right state, wasn't the right mind
Love is like problems, we all got 'em
How come when you stop a problem
Everybody problems become your problem?
Let 'em cry 'bout it, ain't my problem
Ain't my fault, Mystikal, Silkk the Shocker
Heard it's only thirty seconds to Mars
And it took you even less just to get to my heart

[Outro: Jared Leto]
I have a one-track mind, method to the madness
One track-mind, method to the madness
One track-mind, method to the madness
One track-mind
