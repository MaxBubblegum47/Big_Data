[Verse 1]
I have no doubt about it
This must be love
One little kiss from you
And I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over

[Verse 2]
Yeah the goose pimples baby
Because I feel so good
When you call me like you do
And I feel glad all over
Ooh mercy, I'm rock gone puppy
And I'm happy
And I'm glad all over

[Verse 3]
Your touch sewed me
Like an electric wire
Never thought of make love
It don't take much looking
To see what I've got
But it shows, yes it shows
Come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Yeah!

[Verse 4]
Tried to tell you
How I'm cooking inside
When we're cheek to cheek
My temperature is low
Fever is high
I can't speak
I'm too weak

[Verse 5]
Well come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Well, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
