[Verse 1]
Follow me into the desert
As thirsty as you are
Crack a smile and cut your mouth
And drown in alcohol
Cause down below the truth is lying
Beneath the riverbed
So quench yourself and drink the water
That flows below her head

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, there she goes
Out in the sunshine
The sun is mine
The sun is mine

[Chorus]
I shot my love today, would you cry for me
I lost my head again, would you lie for me

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and bow your head
I need a little sympathy
Cause fear is strong and love's for everyone
Who isn't me
So kill your health and kill yourself
And kill everything you love
And if you live you can fall to pieces
And suffer with my ghost

[Chorus]
I shot my love today, would you cry for me
I lost my head again, would you lie for me
I left her in the sand just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again, would you cry for me

[Bridge]
It's just a burden in my hand
It's just an anchor on my heart
It's just a tumour in my head
And I'm in the dark

[Verse 3]
So follow me into the desert
As desperate as you are
Where the moon is glued to a picture of heaven
And all the little pigs have God

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, there she goes
Out in the sunshine
The sun is mine
The sun is mine

[Chorus]
I shot my love today, would you cry for me, yeah
I lost my head again, would you lie for me
I left her in the sand just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again, would you cry for me
Yeah, would you cry for me
