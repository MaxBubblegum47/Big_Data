[Verse 1]
Well I'm standing here on moving station
All the world is traveling by
To strange outlandish destinations
There they go, I wonder why

[Chorus]
I may be crazy
But I'm no stupid
I get along
I use my silver tongue

[Verse 2]
You know I can dream in any language
Flying on my magic bed
And I don't need to work my passage
All I do is use my head

[Chorus]
I may be crazy
But I'm no stupid
Sometimes I ramble
Then I'm Lucid
I might seem lazy
But I'm hurting no-one
I get along
I use my silver tongue

[Verse 3]
I know exactly what you're thinking
But you don't know what's in my mind
You went too fast and now your sinking
Because you forgot to read the signs
