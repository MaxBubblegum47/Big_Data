[Verse 1]
I can't call you a stranger
But I can't call you
I know you think that I erased you
You may hate me, but I can't hate you
And I won't replace you

[Chorus]
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?

[Verse 2]
I think I'm tired of getting over it
Just starting something new again
I'm getting sick of the beginnings
And always coming to your defenses
I guess it's good to get it off my chest
I guess I can't believe I haven't yet
You know I got my own convictions
And they're stronger than any addiction
And no one's winning

[Chorus]
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?

[Bridge]
You keep me up with your silence
Take me down with your quiet
Of all the weapons you fight with
Your silence is the most violent

[Chorus]
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?

[Outro]
You don't have to tell me
If you ever think of me
I know you see me dancing
Wildly in the fog of your memory
You don't have to tell me
I can still believe
