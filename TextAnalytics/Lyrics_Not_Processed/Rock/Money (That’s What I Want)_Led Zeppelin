But you can give then to the birds and bees

That's what I want (that's what I want)
That's what I want (that's what I want)
That's what I want (that's what I want)
Your love give me such a thrill
But your love don't pay my bills

That's what I want (that's what I want)

But what it don't get, I can't use
