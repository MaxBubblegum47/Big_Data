[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feelin' (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm
Are we havin' fun yet?
(Ah, ah, ah)

[Verse 2]
It's not like you didn't know that
I said I loved you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me (You remind me)
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Ah, ah, ah)
Ooh (Ah, ah, ah)
Oh (Ooh)
Oh (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me (You remind me)
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Outro]
Ooh
Are we havin' fun yet?
Ooh (Ah, ah, ah)
