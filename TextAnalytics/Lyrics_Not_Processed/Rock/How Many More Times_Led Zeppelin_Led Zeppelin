[Verse 1]
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do?
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do?
When I give you all my love
Please, please be true

[Verse 2]
I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I've got to get you together, baby
I'm sure, sure you're gonna call
Oh, when's the last time I done asked you?

[Instrumental break]
2:11 - 4:08

[Interlude]
I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinking it over, just what I had missed
Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then
Whoops, oh no, yeah, well I did it again
Now I' got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way, that makes eleven
But I'm in constant heaven
I know it's all right in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine
I can't get through to her cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give

[Bridge]
Oh, Rosie, oh, girl
Oh, Rosie, oh, girl
Steal away now, steal away
Steal away baby, steal away
Little Robert Anthony wants to come and play
Why don't you come to me, baby
Steal away, alright, alright

[Verse 3]
Well they call me the hunter
That's my name
They call me the hunter
That's how I got my fame
Ain't no need to hide
Ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my gun

[Verse 4]
How many more times, barrel house all night long, alright
How many more times, barrel house all night long?
Well, I've got to get to you, baby
So, please come home

[Outro]
Why don't you listen to me, baby?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?
