[Intro]
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?

[Verse 1]
I see my body in a different light, ay ay ay
As if I woke up in a different life, ay ay ay
Feels like I'm walking with my heart on fire
Somebody pass me the water 'cause I'm burning

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause a little bit's turning into a lot
There's no way I'll be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought I was not
Tell me, tell me, ay ay ay

[Chorus]
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?

[Verse 2]
I've never felt so good, I feel so soft, na na na
And now I know myself, I know my spots, na na na
I didn't know that I could have these thoughts, yeah yeah
Somebody pass me the water 'cause I'm burnin'
¡Qué calor!

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause a little bit's turning into a lot
There's no way I'll be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought I was not
Tell me, tell me, ay ay ay

[Chorus]
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?

[Bridge]
Everything I thought I knew about me's upside down
Everything is changing, but I think I love it now, ay ay ay

[Chorus]
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?

[Outro]
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?
