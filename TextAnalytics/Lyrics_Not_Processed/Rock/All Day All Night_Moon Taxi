[Chorus 1]
All day and all night
My eyes are open
All day and all night
I've been going
All day and all night
We stay up, we stay on
All day and all night, ooh yeah

[Verse 1]
Well I don't know just where I've been
Same clothes on my back again
And if you see me in the morning
You're bound to see me hanging by a thread

[Verse 2]
One more time before I go
One more night before I know
And if you see me in the evening
You're bound to see me out of my head
And I'll be going

[Chorus 2]
All day and all night
Eyes are open
All day and all night
Keep me going
All day and all night
We stay up, we stay on
All day and all night

[Verse 3]
Whisper words into my ear
Tell me what I need to hear
But I don't close my eyes without you
Even if I have to make it one more day

[Verse 4]
I never know when to say when
The sun is setting once again
And underneath the stars we have until the morning comes
And washes us away
And I'll be going

[Chorus 2]
All day and all night
Eyes are open
All day and all night
Keep me going
All day and all night
We stay up, we stay on
All day and all night

[Bridge]
Keep me going
Keep me going through the day
You're bearing over
Keep me going through the night

All day and all night
All day and all night
All day and all night
All day and all night

[Chorus 2]
All day and all night
Eyes are open
All day and all night
Keep me going
All day and all night
We stay up, we stay on
All day and all night
Ohohoh...
Ohohoh...
Um yea
