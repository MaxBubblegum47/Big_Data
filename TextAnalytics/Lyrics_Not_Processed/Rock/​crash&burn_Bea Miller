[Verse 1: Bea Miller & 
Both
]
I know that it's been written before
But up until now couldn't find the words 'cause
Ain't nobody gotten 
through to me
Nobody else but 
you to me
Nobody else can turn me inside out 
inside myself

[Pre-Chorus: 
Both
]
And I can't take it when you look me in my eyes

[Chorus: Bea Miller & 
Both
]
Ain't nobody gotten 
through to me
Nobody gotten 
through to me
Nobody gotten, nobody-body got through, 
but you
Ain't nobody gotten 
through to me
Nobody gotten 
through to me
Nobody gotten, nobody-body got through, 
but you

[Post-Chorus: Bea Miller]
I wanna be yours
And you wanna be mine
And everyone else been a waste of my time

[Verse 2: Bea Miller & 
Both
]
I know that it's been written before
But I wanna let you know that I adore you
You're the only one who makes me feel so 
high
But I won't crash and burn this time

[Pre-Chorus: 
Both
]
And I can't take it when you look me in my eyes

[Chorus: Bea Miller & 
Both
]
Ain't nobody gotten 
through to me
Nobody gotten 
through to me
Nobody gotten, nobody-body got through, 
but you
Ain't nobody gotten 
through to me
Nobody gotten 
through to me
Nobody gotten, nobody-body got through, 
but you

[Post-Chorus: Bea Miller]
I wanna be yours
And you wanna be mine
And everyone else been a waste of my time

[Chorus: Bea Miller & 
Both
]
Ain't nobody gotten 
through to me
 (nobody, nobody)
Nobody gotten 
through to me
 (no one)
Nobody gotten, nobody-body got through, 
but you
 (but you, but you)
Ain't nobody gotten 
through to me
 (but you, but you)
Nobody gotten 
through to me
Nobody gotten, nobody-body got through, 
but you
