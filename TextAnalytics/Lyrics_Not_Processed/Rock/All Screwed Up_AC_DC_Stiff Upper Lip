Get ready!

[Verse 1]
You think you're kinda tough
You're walking kinda rough
When you want any more
You go fast whoa, whoa, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
Things go tough
And you strut your stuff
And I want your thing
Then you're out of luck
Yes, you are

[Chorus]
It's all screwed up
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
All screwed up

[Verse 2]
Take you out to kick some butt
Work you over, screw you nuts
And when you can't take no more
Then she push you out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
And things go hard
Like a dog gone mad
She can pack some punch
Then, you're out to lunch (back at 1:00)

[Chorus]
It's all screwed up
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
All screwed up

[Bridge]
It's all screwed up
It's all screwed up
Can't tell one from the other
All screwed up

[Solo]

[Chorus]
I said, it's all screwed up
All screwed up
Said, you're all screwed up
All screwed up
It's all screwed up (yes it is)
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
All screwed up

[Outro]
Screwed up
It's all screwed up
It's all screwed up
Said, you think you pack some punch
But you're always out to lunch
It's all screwed up
It's all screwed up
It's all screwed up
Yes it is
All screwed up
It's all screwed up, yeah
