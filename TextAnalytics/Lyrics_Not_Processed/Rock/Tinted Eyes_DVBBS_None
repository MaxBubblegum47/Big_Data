[Verse 1: blackbear]
Keep me in your prayers, got me running scared
You turned me into someone I don't wanna be
But I don't even care, though, I'm dead and unaware, though
I only feel alive when you hurt me
Spend whatever on you, spend a minute on you
I know I'm gonna lose, I do it anyway
There's a killer in you, and it's killing me too
I know I'm gonna lose, I do it anyway

[Chorus: blackbear]
Don't tempt me with those tinted eyes
This don't feel right, I should know better
Just like a sin, those tinted eyes
Hold your disguise, I should know better

[Post-Chorus: blackbear]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't tempt me with those tinted eyes
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Don't tempt me with those tinted eyes)

[Verse 2: blackbear & 24kGoldn]
Yeah, all I want is how I found ya
No need to change while you feel the pressure, uh
All the nights, all nostalgia
I'll need something strong to get me through forever (Yeah, yeah)
Like a potion, bottled up emotions
Back and forth and up and down
Just going through the motions (Motions)
I'm just hopin' you don't leave me broken
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
Round and round, we lost and found
The meaning of devotion (Devotion)

[Bridge: 24kGoldn]
Insane that you think this could last forever
I can't (I can't), lie to you to make it better
You say, "We'll make it through the stormy weather"
But I told ya, I told ya, I told ya

[Chorus: blackbear]
Don't tempt me with those tinted eyes
This don't feel right, I should know better
Just like a sin, those tinted eyes
Hold your disguise, I should know better

[Post-Chorus: blackbear]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't tempt me with those tinted eyes
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't tempt me with those tinted eyes
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't tempt me with those tinted eyes
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Don't tempt me with those tinted eyes)

[Outro: blackbear]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Don't tempt me with those tinted eyes)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Don't tempt me with those tinted eyes)
