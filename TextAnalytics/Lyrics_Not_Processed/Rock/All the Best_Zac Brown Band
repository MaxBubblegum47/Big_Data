I wish you love
And happiness
I guess I wish
You all the best
I wish you don't
Do like I do
And go and fall in love with someone like you

Cause if you fell
Oh, like I did
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But a kid don't know
He could only guess
How hard it is
To wish you happiness

Well I guess love
Is like a Christmas card
You decorate a tree
And throw it in the yard
It decays and dies
And the snowmen melt
Well I knew love
I knew how love felt

I knew love
Oh, and love knew me
When I walked around, love walked with me
But I got no hate
And I got no pride
But I got so much love that I cannot hide

So you drive a Chevy
So you drive a Ford
So you drive around all night till you just get bored
Then you change your mind
For something else to do
Then your heart changes your mind and it changes you

I wish you love
And happiness
I guess I wish
You all the best
I wish you don't
Do like I do
And go and fall in love with someone like you

If you fell
Oh, like I did
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But a kid don't know
He could only guess
How hard it is
To wish you happiness
How hard it is
To wish you happiness
