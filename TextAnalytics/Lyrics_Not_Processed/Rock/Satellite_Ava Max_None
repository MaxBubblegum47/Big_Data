[Verse 1]
Got me wide awake and dreamin'
You give love a deeper meanin'
Keep exposing all my secrets
And you know you got my heart beatin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Out my chest
Out of breath
Don't give up
Not till we're above the clouds
I give it till there's nothing left
I'm obsessed
Keep it up
We ain't ever coming down

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is flashing lights
Make me feel like I can fly
Higher than a satellite
(oh oh oh)
Higher than a satellite
(oh oh oh)
Higher than a satellite

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
When we get to where we're goin'
Come and fill me with emotion
Oh you leave my body glowin'
And you know you got my heart beatin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Out my chest
Out of breath
Don't give up
Not till we're above the clouds
I give it till there's nothing left
I'm obsessed
Keep it up
We ain't ever coming down
(oh oh oh)

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is flashing lights
Make me feel like I can fly
Higher than a satellite
(oh oh oh)
Higher than a satellite
(oh oh oh)
Higher than a satellite

[Drop]
