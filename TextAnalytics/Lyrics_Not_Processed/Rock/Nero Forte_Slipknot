[Intro]
Watch this

[Verse 1]
I'm never enough
You bleed me dry, using me up
Dissatisfied and used
Another key to the empty spot in you
I'm sick as a fuck
I'm in my prime, what do you want?
I guess it's time to see
If you're lost in hell, you'll find no peace
Ooh, wade through hate and fear
I haven't felt like this in years
Not much left, so uprooted
Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
And I know where I need to go
But the voice of reason can't say no
It's in the eyes and heart
Just the latest psycho off the charts

[Pre-Chorus]
That's what you do best

[Chorus]
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

[Verse 2]
I know, and even if I didn't, I would lie so
Many would believe it
Stand up and resist the chains
Of all the people in belligerent sick restraint
I wasn't enough
You bled me dry, which way is up?
Oh, you're a lie and a fake
I hope the truth is not too late

[Pre-Chorus]
That's what you do best

[Chorus]
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

[Post-Chorus]
That's what you do best
That's what you do best
That's what you do best (Hahahaha)

[Bridge]
(Why) Why was it easy for you?
(Did) Did I deserve the abuse?
(I) I can't believe I let it
(Not) Not what I wanted
(See) See through your bullshit
(Your) You're so traumatic
(True) True to your form of
(Face) Every consequence
(Un-) Unintimidated
(-'til) 'Til the very end
(It) It'll never happen
(Was) Was it all a lie?
(Too) Many motherfuckers
(Late) That's what you do best
(Lie) That's what you do best
(Lie) That's what you do best
That's what you do best

[Chorus]
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

[Outro]

(That's what you do best)
(That's what you do best)
(That's what you do best)

(That's what you do best)
That's what you do best, that's what you do best
