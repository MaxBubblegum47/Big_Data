[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I hope it's not too late
I got my whole life packed inside a suitcase
Riding in a Chevy that shoulda been a Mercedes
Trying to keep my head above water so I stayed out the Navy
I, I made a promise to my girl
So I'mma leave town and bring back the whole world
So I bought a ticket, took longer than expected
Came back around like a necklace and the first thing she said was
(It's too late)
Like "nigga I got needs too
I found a man that gave me what I need now I don't need you
I barely got a text, a call back, you old lying ass nigga
You a dog, out here chasing paper, fucking bitches, nah
Nah nigga you too late
Live with it, now you got a roommate"
My homie served ten years it's too late for him to be treated equally
Too late for him to make it out the hood legally
Riding around doing my thing
Is it too late to be trying to live dreams
And turn them all real, reality is just a technicality
So is being fake so don't tell me that I'm too late

[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Alarm clock said I'm too late
And they said I'm too weak, I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long and don't look too strong
Well how long would you take
Waiting's got me here in the first place
Another second, I'd be second maybe third in the worst case
Now on display are my word plays
Moving weight - it's such a trap
Move and wait you can't do that
I know I'm dope man but I can't move crack
And it's such a fractured way of thinking 'bout your plans
But I try to bring it back before your brain hit the pan
Sean from Detroit, Lupe from Chicago-land
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers designed both of the sedans
Ride with Mr. Right-On-Time or stay Ms Another Chance
Man - redirected at the girls
Not an ultimatum just an option in this world
Where things come and go when the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing, a little late for a lot, huh

[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late
I hope it's not too late, too late

[Bridge]
I hope it's not too late
I hope it's not too late
The last thing I wanna hear is too late, yeah
Tell me is it too late for me to try and change the world
Is it too late to say I wanna change girls
Is it too late even though I'm the shit
Is it too late to tell y'all to suck my dick, bitch

[Outro]
I do it, too late for what
If I want it I need it if I need it I got it
Finally Famous in this, G.O.O.D
