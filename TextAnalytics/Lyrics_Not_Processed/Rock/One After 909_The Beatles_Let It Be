[Verse 1]
My baby said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Verse 2]
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Chorus]
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman said "you've got the wrong location"
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

[Verse 1]
Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Chorus]
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

[Verse 1]
Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 9-0
Said she's travelling on the one after 9-0
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

Oh, Danny boy, the old savanna calling
