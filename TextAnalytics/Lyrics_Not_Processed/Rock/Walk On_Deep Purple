[Chorus]
If you don't like what you see
If you can do better than me
Walk on

[Verse]
If the road before you winds
Obscuring al the signs
Walk on
You mean more to me
Than just a pretty face
I won't hold you down
You need a little space

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You know I don't like to fight
No matter who's wrong or right
Walk on
