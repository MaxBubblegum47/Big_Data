[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know

[Verse 2]
I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

[Bridge]
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her

[Verse 1]
I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Bridge]
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her

[Verse 2]
Though I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

[Outro]
