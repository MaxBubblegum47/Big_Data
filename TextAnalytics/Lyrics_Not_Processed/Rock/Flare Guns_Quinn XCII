[Verse 1: Quinn XCII]
Focus on you in the light, it helps me fill my emotions
Why are we at such a distance? Find ourselves so out of frame
This love stays calm in the night, yeah, help me heal and reopen
Why are we drifting away from everything we wanted to save?

[Pre-Chorus: Quinn XCII]
I told you I'd be down forever
Loving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong
It's old news, I should look for better
Falling back to strangers, leave me hanging on

[Chorus: Quinn XCII]
Flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
Still I dial those numbers every time
Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
Slowly wishing you were never mine

[Verse 2: Chelsea Cutler]
Your face became all I know, I'd try to picture another
Why are we frayed at the edge, it's making me feel Iâ€™m to blame
I wanna know what's the deal
Where have you been and what do you think of me?
Is there a new girl silently screaming your name?

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Quinn XCII]
I told you I'd be down forever
Loving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong
It's old news, I should look for better
Falling back to strangers, leave me hanging on
You leave me hanging on

[Chorus: Both]
Flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
Still I dial those numbers every time
Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
Slowly wishing you were never mine

[Post-Chorus: Both]
I told you I'd be down forever
Loving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong
It's old news, I should look for better
Falling back to strangers, leave me hanging on

[Bridge: Chelsea Cutler & Quinn XCII]
See, I don't know better than to give up on loving
Why am I still holding on? I'm still holding on
And I'm way too honest and you make me want it
Lying alone all night long, alone all night long

[Chorus: Quinn XCII & Chelsea Cutler]
When flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
Still I dial those numbers every time
Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
Slowly wishing you were never mine

[Chorus: Both, (Quinn XCII)]
Flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
Still I dial those numbers every time
(Still I dial those numbers every time)
Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
Slowly wishing you were never mine
(Slowly wishing you were never mine)
