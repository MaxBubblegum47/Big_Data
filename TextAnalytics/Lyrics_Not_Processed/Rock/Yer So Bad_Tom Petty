[Verse 1]
My sister got lucky, married a yuppie
Took him for all he was worth
Now she's a swinger dating a singer
I can't decide which is worse

[Chorus]
But not me baby, I've got you to save me
Oh, yer so bad, best thing I ever had
In a world gone mad, yer so bad

[Verse 2]
My sister's ex-husband can't get no lovin'
Walks around dog-faced and hurt
Now he's got nothin', head in the oven
I can't decide which is worse

[Chorus]
But not me baby, I've got you to save me
Oh, yer so bad, best thing I ever had
In a world gone mad, yer so bad

[Chorus]
Oh, but not me baby, I've got you to save me
Oh, yer so bad, best thing I ever had
In a world gone mad, yer so bad

[Chorus]
Oh, yer so bad, best thing I ever had
In a world gone mad, yer so bad
