[Intro]
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da

[Verse 1]
I’m tuggin' at my hair
I’m pullin' at my clothes
I’m tryna keep my cool, I know it shows
I’m starin' at my feet
My cheeks are turnin' red
I’m searchin' for the words inside my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’m feelin' nervous
Tryna be so perfect
'Cause I know you’re worth it, you’re worth it, yeah

[Chorus]
If I could say what I wanna say
I'd say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezin' you too tight?
If I could say what I wanna see
I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I’m wishing my life away
With these things I’ll never say

[Verse 2]
It don’t do me any good
It’s just a waste of time
What use is it to you what’s on my mind?
If it ain’t comin' out (It ain't comin' out)
We’re not goin' anywhere
So why can’t I just tell you that I care?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I’m feelin' nervous
Tryna be so perfect
'Cause I know you’re worth it, you’re worth it, yeah

[Chorus]
If I could say what I wanna say
I'd say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezin' you too tight?
If I could say what I wanna see
I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I’m wishing my life away (Uh)
With these things I’ll never say

[Bridge]
(What is wrong with) What's wrong with my tongue?
These words keep slippin' away
(Stutter) I stutter (Stutter), I stumble
Like I’ve got nothin' to say

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I’m feelin' nervous
Tryna be so perfect
'Cause I know you’re worth it, you’re worth it, yeah

[Interlude]
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da (Yeah)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da
Guess I’m wishing my life away
With these things I’ll never say

[Chorus]
If I could say what I wanna say
I'd say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezin' you too tight?
If I could say what I wanna see
I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I’m wishing my life away
With these things I’ll never say
These things I’ll never say
