[Verse 1]
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken away my sweet desire, oh now
Some other guy now, I just don't want to hold my hand, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right

[Verse 2]
Some other guy now, is sipping up the honey like a yellow dog, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love just like I'm gone, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
Oh yeah! Ow! Ow!

[Verse 3]
Some other guy, is making me very very mad, oh now
Some other guy now, is making my past seem oh so bad, oh now
Some other guy now, she was the first girl I ever had, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Oh oh hoho
I'm a-talking to you, right now
Ow!

[Outro]
Hey! Yeah!
