[Verse 1]
I love myself, I wanna see it
When I turn around, look in the mirror
And if you don't like it, you can leave it
'Cause it's my own and I'll keep owning it
If you don't like what I'm wearing
Well, you're only bothered 'cause you're staring
And you'll never talk me into caring
'Cause it's my own and I'll keep owning it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma do just what I want on the regular
And it's really not my fault if you're scared of a

[Chorus]
Sweet little unforgettable thing, unforgettable
Sweet little unforgettable thing, so incredible
No and I'm not sorry, I'm just loving my body
I don't care if you scared of a sweet little unforgettable thing

[Verse 2]
I love my ass, I wanna shake it
You can thank my mama 'cause she made it
Don't you waste your breath tryna change it
Just mind your own and I'll keep owning it
We gotta learn to stick together
Love your color, gender or whatever
'Cause your happiness don't need a censor
Just mind your own and we'll keep owning it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma do just what I want on the regular
And it's really not my fault if you're scared of a

[Chorus]
Sweet little unforgettable thing, unforgettable
Sweet little unforgettable thing, so incredible
No and I'm not sorry, I'm just loving my body
I don't care if you scared of a sweet little unforgettable thing

[Bridge]
Shame, shame, shame on me, shame, shame, shame
Shame on me, baby, I ain't gon' change
Shame, shame, shame on me, shame, shame, shame
Shame on me, baby, I ain't gon' change (No, no, no)

[Chorus]
Sweet little unforgettable thing, unforgettable
Sweet little unforgettable thing, so incredible
No and I'm not sorry, I'm just loving my body
I don't care if you scared of a sweet little unforgettable thing

[Outro]
Shame, shame, shame on me
Shame on me, baby
Shame, shame, shame on me
Shame on me, baby
Sweet little unforgettable thing
