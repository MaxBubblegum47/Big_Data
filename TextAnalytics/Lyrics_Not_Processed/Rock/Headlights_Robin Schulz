[Verse 1]
Oh, I know why you're chasing all the headlights
Oh, cause you're always tryna get ahead of life
Baby when you fall
You know I'll be waiting on the other side
And I know it's cold
But if you stay then I could keep you warm at night

[Chorus]
Don't be a fool for the city nights
I know it's 
cruel
 but it's only 
life
Baby, with you I could never lie
Don't go chasing all the headlights

[Verse 2]
Oh, I could feel the beating of your heart on drum
Oh, don't know if I'm dreaming or if you have gone
Every time you call
Hits me like a bullet from a golden gun
Yeah, I know it's cold
But if you stay then I could give you all my love

[Chorus]
Don't be a fool for the city nights
I know it's cruel but it's only life
Baby, with you I could never lie
Don't go chasing all the headlights

[Chorus]
Don't be a fool for the city nights
I know it's cruel but it's only life
Baby, with you I could never lie
Don't go chasing all the headlights
