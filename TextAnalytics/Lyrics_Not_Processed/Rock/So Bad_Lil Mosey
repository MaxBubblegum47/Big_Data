[Chorus]
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, I don't really cuff girls
But baby, I'll cuff you, 'cause I really want you, yeah
I really want you, you so bad, baby, tell me, why don't you
Come my way, all I want to do is see your face
We can take it slow, this ain't no race
But we can speed up if that's okay, yeah, if that's okay
Every time you walk by, I just wanna put you on replay
See you walk by again, baby, you a ten
Can I be your man? And we can just chill, I ain't gotta go in, say, we could take it slow
Baby, you already know this the wintertime
Dark early, and it snow
So we can stay in, it's the cuffing season, I'ma stay until the end

[Chorus]
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah

[Verse 2]
Girl, nothing lasts forever
But baby, I swear I can fuck you 'til whenever (Yeah, yeah)
Usually, I play, but I ain't playing whatsoever
However, we could do it how you want it
Girl, they don't want to sever
But we could do it better, swear I'ma keep tryin', I won't ever let up
My last girl, she was so damn fed up
Yeah, I swear every day, she was telling me whatever
I'm tired of these hoes that be wanting me so perfect
But girl, you different now, swear you so damn perfect, yeah

[Chorus]
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now I got you where I wanna
Baby, you so fine, can I have you 'til the summer?
If I had you, we could do whatever we wanna
When I get you, I'ma rope you in like vanilla
Too fucking bad, baby, they a fashion killer
Seen you looking down, I said,"Baby, keep your chin up"
I'm growing onto you, now I got you, baby hold up
Now you can tell them, tell all them niggas, say, "Back up"
Baby, you mine, I'ma keep you 'til the sun up (Sun up), yeah

[Chorus]
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
You so bad, yeah, and baby, I want you so bad, yeah
