[Verse 1]
Try to tell me what I shouldn't do
You should know by now
I won't listen to you
Walk around with my hands up in the air
'Cause I don't care (Care)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm alright, I'm fine
Just freak out, let it go

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live my life
I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise
'Cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out, let it go
Just freak out, let it go

[Verse 2]
You don't always have to do everything right
Stand up for yourself
And put up a fight
Walk around with your hands up in the air
Like you don't care (Care)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm alright, I'm fine
Just freak out, let it go

[Chorus]
I'm gonna live my life
I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise
'Cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out, let it go

[Bridge]
On my own
Let it go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
Just let me live my life
I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise
'Cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out, let it go

[Outro]
Gonna freak out, let it go
Gonna freak out, let it go
