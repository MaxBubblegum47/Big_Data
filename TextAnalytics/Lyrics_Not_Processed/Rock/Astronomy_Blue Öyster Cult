[Verse 1: Eric Bloom]
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds
Like silver scrapes in May
Now, the sands become a crust
And most of you have gone away

[Verse 2: Eric Bloom]
Come Susy dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you want to know where winds come from
Well, it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the four winds bar

[Bridge: Eric Bloom]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Four winds at the four winds bar
Two doors barred and windows barred
One door let to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
In hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Or the light that never, never warms
Never warms, never warms

[Verse 3: Eric Bloom]
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Suzy dear
Would find themselves at the four winds bar
It's the nexus of the crisis
The origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

[Bridge: Eric Bloom]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Call me Desdinova, eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent

[Outro: Eric Bloom]
Astronomy... a star
Astronomy... a star
Astronomy... a star
