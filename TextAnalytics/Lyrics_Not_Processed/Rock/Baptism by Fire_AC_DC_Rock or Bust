[Verse 1]
Let’s get the party started
And, lady, do your tricks
Let’s get the joint a-jumping
The boys need their kicks
(Ha ha ha ha)
We’re gonna shock the nation
And make ‘em flip their lids
You know you need a vacation
Ooh, bring along a bottle and enjoy the trip

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, ride, ride, ride
Up all night
Ride
It’ll blow your mind

[Chorus]
Baptism by fire
Go with them rolling tires
Baptism by fire
You snap a burning wire

[Bridge]
Play your hand
Come on, and make a stand, hey

[Verse 2]
You hear her clap of thunder
Or feel her lightning spike
You get your pistons firing
It’s Lady Fortune’s night

[Pre-Chorus]
Ride, ride, ride
Up all night
Ride
It’ll blow your mind

[Chorus]
Baptism by fire
Now with them rollin' tires
Baptism by fire
You feel the burnin' wire
Baptism by fire
Shooting high and shooting higher, yeah

[Bridge]
Play your hand
Come on, and play your hand
And let me show you how, yeah
Come on, and make a stand

[Solo]
It’ll blow your mind

[Chorus]
Baptism by fire
Sweet, sweet desire
Baptism by fire
You got the burnin' wire
Baptism by fire
Shooting high and shooting higher
Yeah, yeah, yeah
