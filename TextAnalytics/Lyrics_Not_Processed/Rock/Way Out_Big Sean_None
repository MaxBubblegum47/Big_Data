[Big Sean]
Man I wish that I could kill her
I wish that I could still feel her
Now I'm at the club lookin for a feel up
Bartender make sure my drink stays filled up
Man look at this mess I'm in
In my darkest hour I can't see the horizons
But I still remember her sizes
Thirty-four, twenty-two, thirty-five it, and
And I'm the man to these broads
With one glance I could get 'em to minaj
Through all of the screamin and all the applause
I'm Mr. Big Shot, but you was my star
Hey Juliet, I guess our book's done huh
You know I ain't book smart
Cause I just thought it was a bookmark
And we coulda picked up where we left off
[Mr. Hudson]

There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
Outta your way

[Big Sean]

Man I wish that I could shoot her
I wish that I never knew her
Man what I'm sposed to do huh
She my backbone how I'm sposed to manuever
And I know I said it last time
But I swear last time was the last time
But now she say it's all past times
And I feel like I see my flatline
And I'm supposed to be a man and all
But when you get That involved
You gotta start thinkin with ya head
Nah ya real head not the one in your pants and all
Man she was sposed to be my baby
Man we was sposed to see a baby
Man I woulda gave her everything
Better life, wedding ring, everything we never seen
(I guess we'll never see it now)

[Mr. Hudson]

There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
Outta your way

[Big Sean]

Man I wish that I could stab her
Remember when I used to grab her
I wish a nigga still had her
It's gon' hurt to see another nigga have her
When I call it's no answerin
She ain't love Big Sean she love Sean Anderson
Man you could probably feel me dyin
And you could probably hear her cryin
She killin me from the inside out
Took everything in the crib that was inside, out
She priceless and I can't afford it
You want space baby and I gave you orbit
So come home, Home is where the heart is
She said whenever I'm here I feel heartless
So it's time to part then
I beg your pardon won't be back tommorow, nah

[Mr. Hudson]

There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
There's nothing left to say now
Cause I'll be on my way now
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out
Outta your way, Outta your way, Outta your way, Outta your way
