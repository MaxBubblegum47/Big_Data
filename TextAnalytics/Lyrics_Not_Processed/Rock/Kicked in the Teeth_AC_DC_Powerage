[Intro]
Two face woman with your two face lies
I hope your two face livin' made you satisfied
Ya told me, baby, I was your only one
While you been runnin' 'round town with every mother's son
Hey

[Verse 1]
Two times, told about the women like you
Two times, told about the things you do
I used to think that you were sugar and spice
I shoulda listened to my ma's advice

[Chorus]
Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
Kicked in the teeth again
Ainâ€™t this misery ever gonna end?
And I been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Two face woman, such a cryin' shame
Double or nothin', you all the same
You run around, hope you had your fun
You never know who's gonna win
'Till the race been

[Chorus]
