[Verse 2]
People judged me in school, told me I wouldn't-wouldn't be shit
Now I'm up in Hollywood with them big bihs
I know that I do some shit that's questionable
But my mom said do what I want and I'ma do what she told me
Baby, just hold me
I got no problems, but if I do, I'ma solve 'em
I wanna see you tomorrow
Can you make plans with me, baby?
I just wanna hold your hand, like, what?
When we dance, yeah
Long time ago in Santa Monica Bay, oh
And I ain't know what up, ayy

[Chorus]
I'm out here fuckin' bitches though, who are you?
I'm out here gettin' riches though, who are you?
I'm out here fuckin' bitches though, who are you?
I'm out here gettin'... ayy, who are you?
I'm out here fuckin' bitches though, who are you?
I'm out here gettin' riches though, who are you?
I'm out here fuckin' bitches though, who are you?
I'm out here gettin' riches though, who are you?
