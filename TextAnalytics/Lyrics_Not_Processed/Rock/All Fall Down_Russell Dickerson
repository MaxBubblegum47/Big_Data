[Verse 1]
Five across midnight, dress skin tight, room 203
You reach into my pocket, unlock it, hands all over me
Three little words, do not disturb, hanging from the handle
Feeling this fire, burning all night, like that candle

[Chorus]
So baby let it all fall down
Yeah just let it all fall down
That zipper on your black dress
Jimmy Choo necklace
Red bridal high heel shoes
Purse glittering gold
Baby, I don't want
Nothing on me but you
So let it all fall down

[Verse 2]
We spent all night downtown, now it's time to get down to you and me
Let your worries and your cares and your sugar brown hair just pour all over me

[Chorus]
So baby let it all fall down
Yeah just let it all fall down
That zipper on your black dress
Jimmy Choo necklace
Red bridal high heel shoes
Purse glittering gold
Baby, I don't want
Nothing on me but you
So let it all fall down

[Bridge]
Three little words, do not disturb, hanging from the handle
Let it all loose, from your hair to your shoes, tryna get a handle

[Chorus]
So baby let it all fall down
Yeah just let it all fall down
That zipper on your black dress
Jimmy Choo necklace
Red bridal high heel shoes
Purse glittering gold
Baby, I don't want
Nothing on me but you
So let it all fall down
Won't you let it all fall down
