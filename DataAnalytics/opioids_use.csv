"Except where the prevalence values are taken from household surveys, changes between years need to be interpreted with caution as they might reflect a change in the methodology or the data source from which the estimate was derived and therefore should not be considered as a change in prevalence.
Opioids include prescription opioids, opiates (opiates include opium and heroin). Includes estimates for the countries for which a total Opioid prevalence was reported or available.

Method: HHS=Household survey, SS=School survey, A=Adjusted from other sources, I=Indirect estimates, R=Registry. 

Note: According to the Government of Canada, while prescription opioid use in Canada is reportable (see Table on Prescription opioids), other opioid use was not reportable in 2011, 2012 and 2013; data on heroin and opium use based on the household survey is not reportable and the Government of Canada does not report an estimate based on indirect methods.

UNODC Adjustments: a=adjusted for age (15-64), b=population-based/household-type study/survey, c=adjusted from a limited geographic population-based study/survey, d=adjusted from school/youth survey, e=adjusted from lifetime/monthly prevalence adjusted to annual prevalence, f=adjusted from specialized population surveys (including Rapid Assessments), g=adjusted from treatment data, h=adjusted from drug registries, i=adjusted from HIV, problematic drug users (only for heroin), j=lifetime prevalence reported, x=figure may include non-medical use of prescription opioids, z=figures may also include other non-ATS stimulants, z*= figures include the use of prescription stimulants (non-prescription/non-therapeutic use).   

The 'Method' and 'Adjustment/notes' columns have been completed only for more recent data included in previous and present issues of the World Drug Report. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
